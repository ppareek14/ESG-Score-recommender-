GRI,36,"ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT Introduction BXP committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations  (CNO), or net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent emissions  from operations, by 2025. As of December 31, 2024,   we have officially achieved our 2025 CNO Goal. This ISO  14068-1:2023-aligned Carbon-Neutral Management   Report (CNMR) outlines the approach in achieving this goal.   BXP’s CNMR is delivered and managed by BXP’s  Sustainability Department and is reviewed by BXP’s  Corporate Sustainability Steering  Committee.   The boundary of BXP's 2025 CNO Goal includes direct  and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions associated  with BXP operations at occupied and actively managed  office buildings as defined on Page 8. Scope 1 emissions  are associated with the onsite combustion of fossil fuels   for heating, hot water, and standby generators, in addition   to fugitive emissions associated with the unintended  release of gases or vapors from pressurized equipment  such as HVAC and refrigeration systems"
GRI,38,"1. ENERGY EFFICIENT OPERATIONS – approximately 1/3 of total  carbon reductions by 2025 (below a 2018 base year) from energy  conservation and efficient operations. 2.

Our annual S&I Report, published around Earth Day each year,   continues to detail GHG emissions, reduction efforts,  goal progress, and offsetting activities.

GRI,45,"BXP makes efforts to protect and enhance biodiversity   and ecosystems during the development of new buildings   and the operation of our existing buildings. Much of our  new construction involves the redevelopment of existing  sites, which conserves natural areas and habitats. In some   cases, the redevelopment of sites involves the remediation   of soil and water contamination caused by industrial  activities by others. We design buildings to minimize light  pollution which increases night sky access and reduces  the consequences of development for wildlife and people.   When we install site lighting, we typically model light  levels and specify fixtures that minimize the trespass of  light beyond the site boundary. We are also committed to  supporting biodiversity by maintaining tree canopy cover   and vegetated areas.
