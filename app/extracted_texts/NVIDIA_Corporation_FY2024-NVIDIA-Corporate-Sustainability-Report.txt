Message From Our CEO
Dear NVIDIA Family, Partners, and Supporters,
We are at a pivotal moment in history. NVIDIA’s 
technological leaps in accelerated computing 
and generative AI are at the heart of a new 
industrial revolution, fundamentally reshaping 
industries by enhancing computing power 
and significantly advancing sustainability.
The era of generative AI is here, a 
testament to the accelerated computing 
architecture we envisioned years ago. Our 
breakthroughs have significantly reduced 
computing costs, giving rise to a new 
approach to software development—
deep learning. This revolutionary method 
allows algorithms to write software that 
no human can by uncovering patterns and 
relationships in vast data sets to learn 
the structure and meaning of the data.
From steam-powered machines to electricity, 
then the production of software, each 
of the first three industrial revolutions 
produced something fundamentally new 
that transformed every industry and 
society. We are now on the cusp of making 
something previously unimaginable—digital 
intelligence. The generative AI revolution is 
poised to impact every industry and enable 
a new era of productivity and sustainability 
by unlocking efficiencies and resource 
optimization across sectors. The fourth 
industrial revolution has begun, and the world 
is embracing NVIDIA’s computing platform.
Our commitment to driving these 
changes is unwavering. Our innovations 
in AI and accelerated computing are 
setting new standards for environmental 
responsibility while powering a 
greener, more sustainable future.
NVIDIA Accelerated Computing 
Saves Energy
The era of CPU scaling that propelled the 
computer industry for decades is fading as 
computing demand skyrockets. Software 
pioneers have turned to NVIDIA-pioneered 
accelerated computing as the path 
forward. Accelerated computing is how to 
meet the massive demand for computing 
power sustainably and cost-effectively.
NVIDIA accelerated computing has reached 
an inflection point. NVIDIA is modernizing the 
world’s trillion-dollar data center industry. 
By accelerating workloads with NVIDIA 
GPUs operating in parallel, we exponentially 
increase throughput while driving down 
the total energy used to complete a task 
and, thus, the total cost of ownership. 
The energy savings are incredible.
Accelerated computing took workloads that 
previously required tens of thousands of 
general-purpose servers, consuming 10X to 
20X more cost and energy and compressed 
it into something incredibly dense. Each GPU 
server is more costly and consumes more 
power, but an order of magnitude fewer 
servers are needed. So, there are enormous 
money and energy savings when we look at 
the actual work done or throughput. That is 
precisely why, as CPU scaling has slowed, we 
must transition to accelerated computing—we 
cannot continue scaling out the traditional 
way. Accelerated computing is essential.
NVIDIA Accelerated Computing Is 
Sustainable Computing
NVIDIA already powers the most energy-
efficient supercomputers in the world, which 
scientists across various fields of science 
use to unravel the mysteries of the universe,

harnessing the immense computational 
power to simulate cosmic phenomena, 
decode genetic sequences, and predict 
climate patterns. The Green500 evaluates 
the world’s leading supercomputers based 
on their computational might and energy 
efficiency. NVIDIA technologies power 7 of the 
top 10 systems on the latest Green500 list.
Data processing and management is a 
$100 billion market and a top enterprise 
workload. NVIDIA CUDA GPUs accelerate 
the pervasive Apache Spark data processing 
engine. Benchmark studies show that NVIDIA 
accelerated Spark can reduce the carbon 
footprint of data processing by as much as 
80% while delivering 5X average speedups 
and 4X reductions in computing costs. 
Pandas is the world’s leading data analytics 
library, used by nearly 10 million data scientists. 
Though easy to use, it runs only on CPUs, and 
performance suffers from slow processing 
speeds when working with large datasets. 
To address that, we recently announced 
that NVIDIA has accelerated Pandas up to 
150X for the world’s nearly 10 million Pandas 
users without requiring them to change 
their code. Considering the amount of data 
millions of data scientists process, the time 
and energy saved will be extraordinary.
Training AI Consumes Energy – 
Applying AI Saves Energy
Training AI foundation models requires a lot 
of computing power. These requirements 
will rise as increasingly complex models 
are trained on more data to make them 
smarter, more useful, and safer. The models 
are learning to be more factual and reason 
deeply to give safer, more thoughtful, and 
better-aligned responses. NVIDIA accelerated 
computing is reducing the cost and energy 
usage needed to train these foundational 
AI models with each new generation.
NVIDIA’s new Blackwell platform is a perfect 
example. Blackwell empowers organizations 
worldwide to build and deploy real-time 
generative AI powered by large, trillion-
parameter language models. But that is only 
half of the story. This groundbreaking platform 
also delivers up to an order of magnitude 
lower cost and energy consumption than 
its predecessor for model processing. 
Training models are the start of AI. The 
investment in the cost and energy of training 
aims to create models that, when applied 
or inferencing, will help us discover better 
scientific, engineering, or operational solutions 
that conserve energy, time, and cost.  
The right lens for evaluating AI costs and 
energy is longitudinal, not just training, but 
the long view across the entire lifecycle and 
downstream impact of the AI model created. 
The compounded benefits can be immense. 
When analyzed longitudinally, AI will be utterly 
transformative in driving industrial productivity 
and use less energy, time, and cost.
AI Drives Productivity, Eliminates 
Waste, Saves Energy
We are working with companies 
worldwide to apply AI’s revolutionary 
capabilities to save energy. 
Researchers use AI to discover safer, 
better-performing batteries that use fewer 
natural resources. Microsoft and Pacific 
Northwest National Laboratory used NVIDIA 
accelerated computing to screen over 32 
million potential materials in approximately 
one week. They identified 18 promising 
candidates, including a new electrolyte 
material containing lithium and sodium ions. 
This new material reduces lithium usage by up 
to 70% compared to conventional batteries.
Energy companies are embracing AI to 
reduce operations’ environmental footprint, 
automating labor-intensive tasks, and 
enabling real-time intelligence at the grid 
edge. Portland General Electric is using 
NVIDIA AI inside electric meters to direct 
more renewable energy sources into the 
power grid, reduce power outages, accelerate 
recovery from storms, and ultimately decrease 
operational costs for the electrical grid.
Cadence creates AI chip design tools 
that speed development and help chips 
run faster, use less energy, and cost less. 
MediaTek, whose chips power over 2 billion 
connected devices, has already created a 
5% smaller die and reduced power by 6% 
using this approach. That 6% energy savings 
will be enjoyed by millions of people. So, the 
amount of energy we will save for the world 
by designing better software, chips, and 
systems has a perpetual benefit to society. 
AI Helps Us Adapt to Climate Change
One of AI’s most exciting applications is 
our Earth-2 platform. By teaching an AI to 
recognize and predict weather patterns, 
NVIDIA’s digital twin of our planet can 
predict atmospheric pressure, temperature, 
precipitation, wind speed and direction, 
and humidity at an unprecedented scale 
of two kilometers. Once the Earth-2 model

is trained, it can predict weather 1,000X 
faster and 3,000X more energy-efficiently 
than traditional physics models. 
We want Earth-2 to be available to researchers 
everywhere, so we made APIs available 
via our DGX Cloud. This advances climate 
research and contributes to environmental 
sustainability by reducing the need for 
physics simulations on supercomputers 
and their associated carbon footprint. 
Earth-2 also democratizes high-resolution 
weather prediction and improves predicting 
and tracking severe storms to mitigate 
economic impacts. The Weather Company 
and the Central Weather Administration 
of Taiwan plans to use Earth-2 to catalyze 
proactive decision-making, guiding 
companies, organizations, and nations in 
answering what-if scenarios and anticipating 
unprecedented weather to enable actionable 
outcomes, spanning policy formulation, urban 
development, and infrastructure planning.
An Operating System for Industrial 
Digitalization
Earth-2 is an example of a digital twin that 
models and predicts complex physical 
and dynamical systems. Earth-2 runs 
in NVIDIA Omniverse, a powerful virtual 
world simulation engine where computer 
graphics, physics, and AI intersect.
We created Omniverse to represent and 
model the physical world so that engineers 
can develop AIs and robotic systems that 
can understand and operate in industrial 
applications. Inside Omniverse, companies 
can operate and optimize digital twins 
of their physical infrastructures, such 
as factories, warehouses, farms, and 
processing plants. These virtual replicas 
enable businesses to identify areas for 
improvement and reduce costs, material 
consumption, and energy usage—all critical 
factors in achieving sustainability goals.
The world’s heavy industries represent a 
staggering $100 trillion in value and are 
responsible for a significant portion of global 
energy consumption. NVIDIA can profoundly 
impact sustainability efforts by digitalizing 
these industries through Omniverse and 
leveraging the power of generative AI.
A Computing Platform Shift – A New 
Industrial Revolution
NVIDIA accelerated computing has reached 
a tipping point. Industry is urgently adopting 
NVIDIA as the same architecture is needed 
to save energy, time, and cost, as well 
as for generative AI. The combination of 
accelerated computing and generative AI 
drives a complete full-stack computing 
platform shift transforming every industry.
The new computing stack, generative AI, has 
fundamentally changed how computers work—
from instruction-driven to intention-driven 
computers. Generative AI changes how we use 
computers—from searching and retrieving 
pre-packaged content to interacting with 
real-time generated information unique for 
every context. Generative AI is transforming 
the computer industry that produces 
software into one that manufactures digital 
intelligence. Most importantly, generative AI 
is a new tool for scientists and engineers to 
discover solutions for previously intractable 
challenges—to create a sustainable future.
I am incredibly proud of the strides we 
are making together—our team, partners, 
and global community. Thank you for 
joining us on this transformative journey. 
Together, we are setting new standards 
for what technology can achieve for 
the planet and future generations.

About NVIDIA
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to 
help solve the most challenging computational 
problems. NVIDIA is a full-stack computing 
infrastructure company with data center-
scale offerings that are reshaping industry. 
Our full stack includes the foundational CUDA 
programming model that runs on all NVIDIA 
GPUs, as well as hundreds of domain-specific 
software libraries, software development kits, 
and application programming interfaces. This 
deep and broad software stack accelerates 
the performance and eases the deployment 
of NVIDIA-accelerated computing for 
computationally intensive workloads such as 
AI model training and inference, data analytics, 
scientific computing, and 3D graphics. It 
enables vertical-specific optimizations to 
address industries ranging from healthcare 
and telecom to automotive and manufacturing. 
Our data center-scale offerings are comprised 
of compute and networking solutions 
that can scale to tens of thousands of 
GPU-accelerated servers interconnected 
to function as a single giant computer. 
This type of data center architecture and 
scale is needed for the development and 
deployment of modern AI applications. 
The GPU was initially used to simulate human 
imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of 
video games and films. Today, it also simulates 
human intelligence, enabling a deeper 
understanding of the physical world. Its 
parallel processing capabilities, supported by 
thousands of computing cores, are essential 
for deep learning algorithms. This form of 
AI, in which software writes itself by learning 
from large amounts of data, can serve as the 
brain of computers, robots, and self-driving 
cars that can perceive and understand the 
world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being 
developed by thousands of enterprises to 
deliver services and products that would have 
been immensely difficult or even impossible 
with traditional coding. Examples include 
generative AI—which can create new content 
such as text, code, images, audio, video, and 
molecule structures—and recommender 
systems, which can suggest highly relevant 
content such as products, services, or ads 
using deep neural networks trained on vast 
datasets that capture user preferences. 
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing 
together hardware, systems, software, 
algorithms, libraries, and services to create 
unique value for the markets we serve. While 
the computing requirements of these end 
markets are diverse, we address them with 
a unified underlying architecture leveraging 
our GPUs and networking and software 
stacks. The programmable nature of our 
architecture allows us to support several 
multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same 
underlying technology by using a variety of 
software stacks developed either internally 
or by third-party developers and partners. 
The large and growing number of developers 
and installed base across our platforms 
strengthens our ecosystem and increases 
the value of our platform to our customers. 
Innovation is at our core. We’ve invested over 
$45.3 billion in research and development 
since our inception, yielding inventions 
that are essential to modern computing. 
Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked 
the growth of the PC gaming market and 
redefined computer graphics. With our 
introduction of the CUDA programming model 
in 2006, we opened the parallel processing 
capabilities of our GPU to a broad range 
of compute-intensive applications, paving 
the way for the emergence of modern AI. In 
2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on 
NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet computer 
image recognition competition, marking the 
“Big Bang” moment of AI. We introduced our 
first Tensor Core GPU in 2017, built from the 
ground up for the new era of AI, and our first 
autonomous driving system-on-chips, or SoC, 
in 2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 
expanded our innovation canvas to include 
networking and led to the introduction of a 
new processor class—the data processing 
unit, or DPU. Over the past five years, we’ve 
built full software stacks that run on top 
of our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the 
world’s largest industries, including the 
NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, 
Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for 
industrial digitalization; and introduced the 
NVIDIA AI Enterprise software—essentially 
an operating system for enterprise AI 
applications. In 2023, we introduced our 
first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-
scale AI and high-performance computing. 
NVIDIA’s sustainability reporting follows our 
fiscal calendar; FY24 data corresponds to the 
period January 30, 2023, to January 28, 2024.
Sustainability Governance
We assess corporate sustainability impacts 
to identify our key social and environmental 
impacts, leveraging stakeholder expectations, 
market trends, and risks as well as 
opportunities in the process. We plan to 
conduct a double-materiality assessment, 
assessing sustainability issues based on both 
financial and impact materiality, by the end 
our fiscal year ending January 26, 2025.

The increased frequency and severity 
of extreme weather and climate events 
underscores a critical need for accurate 
weather forecasting, especially with the rise in 
severe weather occurrences such as blizzards, 
hurricanes, and heatwaves. As extreme-
weather events occur with greater frequency 
and, often, with little warning, meteorology 
centers can use accelerated computing to 
generate more accurate, timely forecasts 
that improve readiness and response.
In addition to powering climate and 
weather simulations, AI is accelerating the 
energy transition by making industrial-

Improving performance and energy efficiency 
is a principal goal in each step of our research, 
development, and design processes. We 
develop hardware, software, and networking 
technology to improve performance and 
energy efficiency, helping our customers solve 
problems and decrease emissions intensity.
AI models are exploding in complexity and 
size as they enhance generative AI and 
enable scientific discoveries, and modern 
data centers require accelerated computing 
platforms to effectively execute these 
workloads. Accelerated computing is the use 
of specialized hardware to dramatically speed 
up computation, by parallel processing that 
bundles frequently occurring tasks. It offloads 
demanding work that can bog down traditional 
processors that typically execute tasks in serial 
fashion, and offers lower overall costs, higher 
performance, and greater energy efficiency.
Acceleration completes larger workloads 
more quickly, returning the computer to 
a low-power idle state when done and 
consuming significantly less energy overall 
when compared to traditional computing.

Over the course of the last 8 years, we’ve increased computation by 1000X.
NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs are generally 20X more 
energy efficient than traditional CPUs for 
certain AI and high-performance computing 
(HPC) workloads, and NVIDIA DPUs can reduce 
power consumption by 25% by offloading 
essential data center networking and 
infrastructure functions from less efficient 
CPUs. If these HPC and AI workloads were 
switched from CPU infrastructure to GPU and 
DPU-accelerated operations, we estimate the 
world could save almost 30 trillion watt-hours 
of energy a year, equivalent to the electricity 
requirements of nearly 4 million U.S. homes.
Energy efficiency is critical as AI models and 
HPC applications increase exponentially in 
size. AI workloads such as large language

massive LLMs now extend further into multi-
trillion parameter scale. The NVIDIA GB200 
Grace Blackwell Superchip is estimated to 
offer 25X better energy efficiency over the 
prior Hopper generation for massive LLMs, 
while CPUs have not demonstrated an ability 
to effectively run larger or massive LLMs. 
In FY24, the U.S. Department of Energy clocked 
how fast four of its key high-performance 
computing and AI applications ran and how 
much energy they consumed on CPU-only 
and GPU-accelerated nodes on Perlmutter, 
one of the world’s largest supercomputers. At 
performance parity, a GPU-accelerated cluster 
demonstrated an average 5x improvement 
in energy efficiency. By running the same 
workload on GPUs rather than CPU-only 
instances, researchers could save millions 
of dollars and avoid consumption of 588 
megawatt hours of electricity per month.

Energy and Environment
We’re committed to reducing our 
environmental impact by driving operational 
excellence. We identify and control 
environmental impacts and continuously 
improve our performance using a 
comprehensive environmental management 
system (EMS) certified to ISO 14001, which 
covers our headquarter buildings located in 
Santa Clara, CA and in Yokneam, Israel. Our 
Environmental, Health, Safety, and Energy 
Policy provides the framework for our EMS, 
and our dedicated Environmental, Health, 
and Safety and corporate responsibility 
teams work closely with employees globally 
to execute our environmental policies and 
practices, with actionable goals and metrics 
that are annually reviewed with executives.
To bring a more structured approach to 
managing energy efficiency at several of our 
key data center locations, we have an energy 
management system certified to the ISO 
50001 standard, which covered 55% of our data 
center energy use in FY24. Our certification 
to the ISO 50001 standard recognizes our 
efforts to properly measure and reduce 
energy consumption in our data centers.
Energy-Efficient Operations
Two of our headquarters buildings in Santa 
Clara, CA are LEED Gold certified. Our 
Hyderabad, India campus is also LEED Gold 
certified. Our LEED Gold certified buildings 
were designed to be energy and water 
efficient, built with sustainable raw materials, 
and improved indoor environmental quality. 
For our Santa Clara campus, the two buildings 
are connected by a three-acre park which is 
provided with shade by trellis that houses 390 
kW of solar panels. These solar panels bring 
the total onsite solar generation capacity 
at our headquarters to 846 kW. In FY24, in 
support of our renewable electricity goal, we 
added solar panels at our Hyderabad campus.
In FY24, we increased the amount of our 
renewable electricity use to 76%, through 
on-site renewables and purchasing utility 
renewable electricity tariffs, energy attribute 
certificates and purchase power agreements. 
We are exploring additional options to 
increase our sourcing of renewable energy 
for our growing footprint, in support of 
our 100% renewable electricity goal.
Waste Management
We aim to reduce the amount of waste we 
send to landfill through waste reduction, 
reuse, and recycling initiatives. We’ve engaged 
a vendor to complete a gap analysis of our 
Santa Clara campus to better understand 
opportunities to increase our landfill diversion 
rate and minimize the amount of waste 
generated. We plan to incorporate zero-waste 
principles in our operations, such as reduction 
of overall waste and waste sent to landfills.  
For products we use for testing, R&D, and 
production purposes, we have programs in 
place to support internal re-use of equipment 
that has not reached the end of its useful 
life or financial depreciation life. We properly 
dispose of IT assets and used laptops are 
sold to a vendor for refurbishment and reuse, 
with a portion of the financial proceeds 
donated to the NVIDIA Foundation. For used 
equipment, we use a global specialist e-waste 
recycling vendor. All our vendors follow strict 
certification guidelines and procedures to 
ensure proper tracking of the chain of custody, 
decommissioning, data erasure, and recycling 
of any hardware which is broken and unusable.

Water Conservation
We use water in our direct operations 
in cooling towers and for food service, 
landscaping, and sanitation. We take steps 
to use water efficiently, particularly in 
locations that are vulnerable to drought 
conditions. We conduct an annual water risk 
assessment for all NVIDIA facilities, data 
centers, and strategic supply chain partners 
which helps us understand where water 
conservation initiatives are most needed.
Our two LEED Gold certified buildings in 
Santa Clara, CA, incorporate a range of 
water efficient measures. Through the 
installation of low-flow bathroom fixtures 
and the use of recycled water for toilet 
flushing, the buildings are designed to achieve 
reductions in domestic water demand and 
potable water use for sewage conveyance 
when compared with buildings of standard 
design. We use reclaimed water in cooling 
towers and landscape irrigation systems and 
capture rainwater in bioswales. The three-
acre park that connects the two buildings is 
planted with drought-tolerant trees and the 
greenery is irrigated by reclaimed water.
Outside of Santa Clara, our Hyderabad, 
India, site has a water treatment plant that 
reuses the site’s treated wastewater for 
landscape irrigation.
Within our data centers, we are introducing 
closed loop liquid cooling systems. An 
engineered fluid, comprised of a blend 
propylene glycol, water and inhibitors, is reused 
in these systems, eliminating the loss of water 
through evaporation, and improving the water 
efficiency of data centers. This innovation is a 
cooling alternative that allows high computing 
performance with reduced environmental 
impact. In FY24, NVIDIA’s data center team 
was awarded a U.S. Department of Energy 
grant to build an advanced liquid-cooling 
system, that will save money and run more 
efficiently than today’s air-cooled approaches. 
At our Santa Clara campus, our Voyager and Endeavor buildings are LEED Gold certified and connected by a three-acre park which is provided with shade by a trellis 
that houses solar panels.

Benefits and Compensation
We offer comprehensive benefits programs 
worldwide. Our employees, their families, 
and their welfare are a top priority. Our 
comprehensive benefits program includes an 
employee stock purchase program, access 
to quality healthcare, remote work options, 
flexible hours and paid time off for personal, 
medical, and family care needs. We provide a 
401(k) program in the U.S. and supplemental 
pension programs outside the U.S. where 
statutory schemes are insufficient. 
We provide employees with benefits such 
as reimbursement for eligible adoption, 
surrogacy, and fertility treatment expenses. 
Our parental leave program, available to all 
employees, enables birth parents to take up to 
22 weeks of paid leave, starting as early as four 
weeks before their due date. Nonbirth parents 
get up to 12 weeks of paid leave. To ease the 
transition back to work after their leave, all 
new parents also receive up to eight weeks 
of flex time and access to parenting support 
modules that provide tips and guidance.
We partner with NVIDIA’s nine different 
community resource groups to tailor 
support programs based on targeted 
needs, including military leave, student loan 
repayment, gender affirmation support, 
enhanced health insurance coverage for 
members with developmental delays, and 
mental health counselor search tools.
We evaluate our benefit offerings annually 
to ensure employee needs are met and 
continuously seek feedback from employees 
to advance our support. In FY25, we increased 
our 401(k) match to $11,500, up from $9,000.
Our employees’ well-being, physical, 
emotional, and financial health is a top 
priority, and we aim to support them by 
offering a suite of services where people 
can choose what works best for them.
Pay and Promotion 
We are committed to providing market 
aligned pay and equitable opportunities for 
advancement to all employees. We perform 
an annual review of peer compensation 
in the markets we operate in. Each year, 
every employee’s performance is assessed, 
and managers provide feedback on goals 
and priorities. Promotion readiness is 
reviewed, and compensation is adjusted

appropriately. Employees are provided 
both cash and equity compensation.
Cash compensation adjustments are 
determined based on role, market 
compensation growth and individual 
performance. Equity compensation is provided 
through restricted stock units (RSUs) that 
vest over time and provide value aligned to 
our stock price. We believe RSUs promote 
retention and align with stockholder interests.
Since 2020, we’ve used a third-party firm 
to analyze our pay practices and promotion 
activity across rating, education, years of 
experience, job function, family, and level. The 
review has determined that we’ve achieved pay 
parity, defined as no statistically significant 
differences in compensation based on 
gender, race, or ethnicity, for the past several 
years, and we plan to continue doing so.
In FY24, as we promoted many in our 
workforce, women continue to be promoted 
at an approximately equal rate to men. There 
were no statistically significant differences 
between actual and expected promotion rates.
If the review were to identify statistically 
significant issues in pay or promotions, 
we would take corrective action.
Engagement and Retention
We want NVIDIA to be a place where 
people can build their careers over their 
lifetime. To ensure our continued success, 
we maintain a working environment where 
our employees are engaged and inspired.
To evaluate employee sentiment and 
engagement, we use pulse surveys and a 
suggestion box. Pulse surveys help us gain 
insight into employee experience and provide 
employee-generated ideas so that we can take 
targeted action. This agile approach allows us 
to hear from employees more frequently and 
stay focused on specific areas, while reacting 
quickly to current events. The suggestion 
box is an always-on, interactive tool where 
employees share their thoughts about 
making our company a better place to work.
In addition, we receive feedback through 
an internal portal where all employees can 
submit, view, and vote on suggestions. Our 
CEO responds to questions from employees 
during our quarterly Company meetings.
We provide eight free days per year when 
all NVIDIANs disconnect and recharge, 
which were a direct result of employee 
feedback for structured time off.
Our employees tend to come and stay. 
NVIDIA’s overall turnover of 2.7% remains 
low, compared with the semiconductor 
industry average of 17.7%. The turnover rate 
for women and men has been similar in the 
past several years. In the U.S., retention 
rates for members of underrepresented 
communities have held equal to their peers.
Learning and Development
Being a lifetime learner is core to our culture. 
We have a library of live and on-demand 
learning experiences that include workshops, 
panel discussions, and speaker forums. 
We create learning paths focused on our 
most common development needs and 
constantly upgrade our offerings to ensure 
that our employees are exposed to the most

Responsible Sourcing
We define human rights as the fundamental 
rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment 
belonging to all humans. We seek to promote 
human rights throughout our supply chain 
and expect our suppliers to respect human 
rights whenever they provide products or 
services for us. For our efforts related to 
human rights in our supply chain, see our 
Human Rights section. NVIDIA’s supplier 
selection process incorporates social and 
environmental factors, including risk analysis 
on topics such as RBA code alignment, product 
compliance, and environmental initiatives. 
We hold ourselves and our suppliers to the 
highest standards of behavior, and only 
engage suppliers that share our values. 
We closely manage our supply chain to 
deliver innovative products that satisfy 
our customers’ expectations in a socially 
and environmentally conscious manner.
Responsible Minerals
NVIDIA is committed to the responsible 
sourcing of minerals. We support, contribute 
to, and rely on industry-wide efforts to 
validate the source of minerals used in our 
products, aiming to ensure that they come 
from socially responsible sources and do 
not contribute to human conflict. Our goal 
is to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum, 
tungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products 
and to achieve 100% Responsible Minerals 
Assurance Process-compliant tantalum, tin, 
tungsten, and gold processing facilities.
We evaluate smelter metrics and share an 
annual update in our Conflict Minerals Report. 
We’ve successfully removed non-compliant 
3TG smelters and refiners in our supply 
chain to help us meet this goal. During the 
reporting period, 100% of our suppliers and 
component manufacturers responded with 
the requested information. We also collect 
non-3TG smelter data for cobalt and mica 
from our strategic suppliers and report the 
initial results to customers. As the cobalt and 
mica programs through the RBA’s Responsible 
Minerals Initiative (RMI) matures, our goal is 
to only source from conflict-free refiners.
Our Responsible Minerals Policy, sourcing 
goals, and steps for monitoring our supply 
chain for conflict minerals is framed around 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) Due Diligence 
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of 
Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High- 
Risk Areas (CAHRA). This provides detailed 
recommendations to help companies respect 
human rights and avoid contributing to 
conflict through their mineral purchasing 
decisions and practices. Our conflict minerals 
due diligence program conforms in all material 
respects with the OECD framework.
We’re a member of the Public Private Alliance 
(PPA) for Responsible Minerals Trade and 
the RMI. The PPA provides funding and 
coordination support to organizations 
working within the Democratic Republic of 
Congo and adjacent countries to develop 
verifiable conflict-free supply chains, align 
due diligence programs and practices, 
encourage responsible sourcing from the 
region, promote transparency, and bolster 
in-region civil society and governmental 
capacity. We support these on-the-ground 
programs aimed at improving transparency 
for responsible sourcing and reducing 
human rights risks, including forced labor.

Additionally, we participate in various RMI 
work groups and align our program with the 
organization’s tracking of additional minerals 
and materials, as well as CAHRAs. We monitor 
additional legal requirements, including the EU 
Conflict Minerals Regulations, to determine 
any future obligations regarding conflict 
materials and high-risk regions of the world.
Responsible Supply Chain
We have expanded our supplier relationships 
to build redundancy and resilience in 
our operations to provide long-term 
manufacturing capacity aligned with growing 
customer demand. Our supply chain is 
concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. We 
use foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, 
and Samsung Electronics, or Samsung, to 
produce our semiconductor wafers. We 
purchase memory from Micron Technology, 
Inc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We engage 
with independent subcontractors and contract 
manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision 
Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, 
and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing, 
and packaging of our final products. 
Strategic Suppliers
Strategic suppliers include those who produce 
or handle NVIDIA production materials, 
those for whom we closely manage quality 
requirements, those who design our branded 
products, and those who we’re required to 
work with based on customer agreements.
For strategic suppliers, agreements are 
deployed and tracked through a Quarterly 
Business Review (QBR) process to ensure they 
meet our expectations, which may influence 
our business allocation decisions. Five percent 
of the QBR score is based on environmental 
and social performance, and expectations 
vary by quarter. Each quarter, we assess 
these suppliers by product category and rank 
performance, and we perform an annual risk 
assessment based on RBA results, geography, 
and type of industry. We’ve assessed and 
adjusted business with suppliers who don’t 
comply with minimum requirements. 
We review all strategic suppliers against 
NVIDIA cybersecurity requirements 
and have performed a more in-depth 
assessment of higher-risk suppliers. We 
looked at our suppliers’ conformance to 
ISO 27001, ISO 28001, C-TPAT, and NIST 
standards and evaluated them for additional 
information-, product-, and physical-security 
expectations. If gaps are discovered, we 
expect an improvement plan to align with 
NVIDIA requirements. The cybersecurity 
survey determines supplier risk to be 
low, moderate, or high, and audits are 
conducted on a one- to three-year cycle.
Risk Assessment and Auditing
All our manufacturing suppliers are 
expected to comply with the RBA Code of 
Conduct and associated NVIDIA policies, 
including our Agreement for Manufacturer 
Environmental Compliance. Since 2016, 
all NVIDIA Master Service Agreements 
executed with suppliers require compliance 
with the RBA Code of Conduct.
Our assessment process involves using the 
RBA-Online system to evaluate existing and 
potential new suppliers against product 
compliance industry standards, social 
and environmental criteria, use of conflict 
minerals, the RBA Code of Conduct, and 
NVIDIA’s code of conduct. All suppliers 
are expected to conduct an annual self-
assessment questionnaire (SAQ), and we 
expect biennial Validated Assessment 
Program (VAP) on-site, third-party audits 
to validate the SAQ. We use the results of 
the assessment, which includes a spending 
analysis, to determine their overall risk. 
To ensure consistency, suppliers can share VAP 
audits with customers. Any uncovered findings 
are also made available to those customers. 
Findings are aggregated anonymously by the 
RBA and disclosed in their public annual report.
Common audit findings include issues related 
to freely chosen employment, working hours, 
wages and benefits, emergency preparedness, 
and occupational safety. NVIDIA ensures 
suppliers close all corrective actions in 
compliance with its Full RBA membership tier.
Our goal is to audit 100% of our 
strategic suppliers every two years. 
In FY24, we reviewed VAP audits 
on 67% of our strategic suppliers, 
bringing total audits in the past two 
years to 93%. We engaged 100% of 
strategic suppliers on their corrective 
action plans and continue monitoring 
suppliers to ensure compliance.

Impact
To understand the greenhouse gas emissions 
generated across our product lifecycle 
and in manufacturing, we’ve conducted a 
product carbon footprint analysis for select 
products. We will use the information to 
identify opportunities to reduce emissions. 
Manufacturing
Emissions are generated at every stage of our 
product lifecycle, including manufacturing 
within our supply chain. Since 2014, we’ve 
expected our key silicon manufacturing and 
systems contract manufacturing suppliers to 
report their annual energy and water usage, 
waste, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
and reduction goals and objectives through 
the RBA Environmental Survey or CDP. We 
also expect suppliers to have their GHG 
emissions verified by a third party. We use 
this supplier data to better understand our 
product manufacturing impact and allocate 
carbon emissions to our customers.
We have a goal to engage manufacturing 
suppliers to effect supplier adoption 
of science-based targets. In FY24, we 
engaged suppliers totaling over 60% 
of our scope 3 category 1 emissions. 
We maintain Full Material Disclosures 
for our chip designs and select system 
products, which demonstrates our 
compliance with restricted substances 
including halogenated flame retardants, 
arsenic, and beryllium. Information on 
materials we use is reported through 
various platforms, including Substances 
of Concern in Products and International 
Material Data System for automotive.
Packaging
We continue to optimize the balance between 
protecting the environment and ensuring 
that customers receive products in like-
new condition. We embrace opportunities 
to reduce packaging materials and increase 
the proportion of recycled and recyclable 
materials. Whether products are packaged 
for end users or prepared for bulk shipping, 
we strive to find the balance between 
package density and unboxing experience.  
In FY24, over 90% of our NVIDIA GPU 
systems packaging was recyclable materials 
by weight. NVIDIA continues to progress 
other sustainability initiatives such as 
identifying opportunities to use paper-based 
cushioning in data center products, increase 
packaging recyclability, implement FSC 
paper in corrugate materials, and replace 
printed documentation with online versions 
where possible. We continue to add material 
identification codes to our packaging parts.
90%+
Of our NVIDIA GPU systems 
packaging was recyclable

Transport and Logistics
We plan, pack, and execute our raw 
material, work-in-progress, and finished 
goods shipments to optimize transport 
and logistics, which results in reduced fuel 
use and less impact on the environment.
This includes consolidating shipping 
volumes and weights and implementing a 
multimodal distribution system. An area 
of continued focus is to consolidate the 
number of pickups and shipments.
We expect carriers to report shipment data 
to support carbon emissions calculations 
and have sustainability initiatives, which are 
both covered in quarterly business reviews.

End-of-Life Management 
NVIDIA-branded products are subject to 
electronic waste disposal requirements in 
our various global markets, and we take 
seriously our extended responsibility for 
these products. In key regions such as the 
U.S. and Europe, we’ve established recycling 
programs in partnership with reputable 
third parties and provide information to 
consumers about how to recycle our branded 
products through labeling and our website. 
We help our customers monetize the 
residual value in their older DGX servers 
when refreshing to the latest technology 
with the help of a remarketing partner. 
Older generation DGX systems may be 
resold in the secondary market, and 
systems that are not resold are typically 
broken into components and recycled.
Product Quality and Safety
Safety is a principle that permeates our 
engineering culture. We incorporate it into 
every step of our product development 
process, from design and production 
to the end-user experience. 
Our products undergo rigorous qualification 
and testing to ensure compliance 
with customer safety and reliability 
standards. With these standards in 
mind, we’ve established product safety 
technical committees to oversee safety 
throughout the product lifecycle.
Cross-functional teams manage all aspects 
of product quality. Customer quality 
engineering provides direct customer 
support for all quality-related issues, 
gathers information on customer failures 
and customer-observed failure rates, and 
processes returned material authorization.
As part of the continuous improvement 
process, recommended design enhancements 
are brought to the engineering teams for 
incorporation into next-generation products. 
We monitor our quality management 
system through internal audits and an 
annual third-party ISO 9001 assessment.

Our Code
Our code of conduct outlines our core values 
and establishes the expectations we have 
about how we conduct business. It guides our 
actions in our professional relationships with 
fellow employees, and towards our customers, 
partners, competitors, vendors, government 
regulators, shareholders, and the community 
at large. Our code applies to all employees 
and directors, and we expect all third parties 
we do business with, including consultants, 
contractors, and other service providers, 
to act in a manner consistent with it.
Our code is translated into different 
languages and available on our 
website. We plan to translate into 
additional languages in FY25.
Ethics and Cybersecurity 
We strive to achieve the highest standards 
of ethical conduct in all our business 
dealings and are committed to promoting 
a culture of integrity. NVIDIA employees 
receive code of conduct training upon hire 
and then every two years thereafter. Code 
of conduct training covers topics like ethics, 
preventing workplace harassment, and 
sustainability. Employees who have frequent 
contact with customers, partners, and 
suppliers (such as those in sales, finance, 
and procurement) complete additional global 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption training.  
In addition to employee cybersecurity 
trainings, our Santa Clara headquarters is 
certified to ISO 27001. For more information 
on our approach to cybersecurity, see pp. 31 
of our our 2024 Form 10-K filed with the SEC. 
Investigations Process
Our commitment to promoting a culture 
of integrity means everyone is expected to 
act ethically and feel empowered to voice 
concerns without fear of retaliation.
Anyone can confidentially and anonymously 
submit a complaint about any matter 
of concern. These include accounting, 
internal controls, auditing, code of conduct, 
harassment, conflict of interest, or other 
potential code of conduct, policy, or legal 
violations using our Speak Up corporate hotline 
which is hosted by an independent third party.

of and adherence to NVIDIA’s ethics policies; 
establishes procedures for the receipt, 
retention, and treatment of complaints; and 
promptly and thoroughly conducts ethics-
related investigations in partnership with 
relevant organizations within NVIDIA. The 
Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee oversees the Compliance 
Committee and receives ethics complaints. 
The Compliance Committee periodically 
reviews and assesses the effectiveness of 
its procedures and adjusts as necessary. 
Our third-party auditor reviews cases 
quarterly and process updates annually.
Employees who wish to understand 
NVIDIA’s investigations process have 
access to an online training course.
Trustworthy AI
We endeavor to deliver AI models that:
Perform safely and 
as intended,
Provide transparency 
about a model’s design 
and limitations, and
Minimize unwanted bias 
and give equal opportunity 
to benefit from AI.
Comply with privacy and 
data protection laws,
Our Trustworthy AI principles, which we 
share with customers and partners, reflect 
our core values and code of conduct.
Scope and Governance
To build Trustworthy AI (TAI), we are 
developing practices, methodologies, 
and tools for datasets, machine learning 
frameworks, AI model development, and 
software development and testing. We 
aim to build tools and processes that 
enable us, our customers and partners, 
and the ecosystem to build TAI models.   
Our TAI efforts are led by a head of AI & Legal 
Ethics and is supported by a dedicated product 
team. By design, this team is structured to 
work cross-functionally with product, product 
security, safety, and infrastructure teams to 
ensure our AI aligns to our principles. The Audit 
Committee of our Board receives periodic 
updates on our TAI program and initiatives.
Our global public policy team monitors 
global regulations and relevant standards 
to ensure we maintain compliance. In FY24, 
we piloted an AI Ethics Committee to 
advise on generative AI development with 
members of our engineering, business, and 
legal organizations. We also launched an 
internal training module to introduce ways 
to incorporate TAI principles into our work.
Standards and Frameworks
We look to global frameworks such as the 
EU’s High-Level Expert group on Artificial 
Intelligence, the U.S. White House AI Bill 
of Rights, and Singapore’s Model Artificial 
Intelligence Governance Framework to 
guide our software development processes, 
from concept to performance validation to 
decommission. We participate in industry-
driven initiatives like ML Commons, as 
well as standards bodies like the IEEE 
Organizational governance of Artificial 
Intelligence Working Group. In FY24, NVIDIA 
joined the NIST AI Safety Consortium 
and Content Authenticity Initiative, which 
are focused on the development and use 
of safe and trustworthy AI systems.

Model Risk Management
NVIDIA aims to reduce the risk of harm 
from deployment of AI models or systems. 
Model risk can come from many sources, 
including datasets used to train the model, 
malicious attacks against the model, or 
failure to comply with laws and regulations.
Our model risk management guidance is 
integrated into our AI product lifecycle 
process, and outlines to all employees working 
on models the elements of development, 
validation, audit, and documentation. 
This approach provides internal development 
teams with guidance to achieve an innovative 
yet ethically responsible solution. 
Externally, NVIDIA offers toolkits like 
NeMo Guardrails for easily developing safe 
and trustworthy large language model 
conversational systems like ChatGPT.  
100+
Model cards enhanced across all 
domains to meet the 
Model Card++ standard
Translates our principles 
into actionable product 
life cycle requirements.
Is aligned with and 
incorporates our 
privacy policy.
Outlines steps to identify, 
measure, manage, and 
mitigate risks from 
our AI and machine 
learning solutions.
Model Card Improvements
Model cards ensure NVIDIA is communicating 
in the clearest language how its technology 
was made and should be used when 
developers work with our AI models. We’ve 
enhanced our model cards to make them more 
understandable to consumers, investors, and 
policy makers. Those enhancements focused 
on improved readability with clear language, 
increased detail around ethical considerations, 
and greater accessibility on our website. In 
FY24, we enhanced more than 100 model cards 
across all domains to meet the Model Card++ 
standard. We also briefed and demoed Model 
Card++ to federal government employees 
and the Society of Automotive Engineers. 
We’ve designed and continue to improve several 
tools for internal developers to aid in the 
creation of TAI models:
An inspection dashboard that 
measures a model’s completion of 
essential steps prior to publication, 
and which includes a current 
performance score and a target goal.
Model requirement and dataset 
approval processes that must be 
met prior to commercial release.
AI and machine learning dataset 
classification guidance document 
to support classifying and 
labeling of vetted datasets.
Model cards that accompany our 
published models and provide 
information and guidance on 
a model’s uses and limitations, 
including ethical considerations 
such as explainability and privacy.

Human Rights
The NCG Committee has oversight of 
policies and practices in connection with 
human rights and provides periodic updates 
to the Board. At the management level, 
our Corporate Sustainability Steering 
Committee is responsible for reviewing and 
ensuring the effectiveness of our human 
rights program. Through this governance 
body and related executive engagement, 
management undertakes all actions it 
deems reasonable and necessary to ensure 
compliance with our Human Rights Policy.
We regularly assess human rights-related 
risks and potential impacts, review our policies 
and management processes, and seek input 
from stakeholders on our approach. We have 
begun preparation for a human rights impact 
assessment across our value chain. We plan 
to use the results of that assessment to 
enhance our human rights policy and program.
All our employees are required to complete 
training on our code, which includes our 
commitment and guidelines to respect 
human rights. Employees, suppliers, and 
other external stakeholders can confidentially 
and anonymously report a concern about 
human rights using our Speak-Up line, 
which is available in seven languages.
Our investigations team will promptly 
investigate human rights allegations it 
becomes aware of through our Speak 
Up line and present any findings to the 
Compliance Committee that require the 
input of that committee. We do not tolerate 
retaliation against anyone for making a 
complaint in good faith, bringing a potential 
violation to the attention of management, or 
participating or assisting in an investigation.
NVIDIA has been a signatory of the UN 
Global Compact since June 2022. We are 
also a member of the Responsible Labor 
Initiative (RLI), the Public-Private Alliance 
for Responsible Minerals Trade (PPA), and 
the Responsible Minerals Initiative.
Upstream Human Rights 
We take the issue of forced labor very 
seriously and conduct regular audits to ensure 
all workers in our supply chain are treated with 
respect and dignity. We are full members of 
the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and 
work with them and similar industry groups 
to prevent and eliminate forced labor from 
global supply chains. Through the RBA, we 
also work with expert organizations, NGOs, 
and academia to advance our program and 
standards, and we support efforts at an 
industry level to identify and remediate actual 
and potential cases of labor and human 
rights abuse. Our supplier audits have not 
identified incidents of forced Uyghur labor. 
We expect our suppliers to maintain 
progressive employment, health, safety, 
and ethical practices that meet or exceed 
applicable laws, the RBA Code of Conduct, 
our code of conduct, and our Human Rights 
Policy. We also encourage suppliers to use 
the RBA Code of Conduct as a platform 
to go above and beyond compliance. We 
participate in RBA’s RLI and monitor our 
supply chain through VAP audits, which 
cover freely chosen employment, child 
labor, and freedom of association. 
In FY24, we reviewed VAP audits on 67% 
of our strategic suppliers, bringing total 
audits in the past two years to 93%. If we 
uncover findings during these audits, we 
work directly with suppliers to implement 
any corrective actions. In FY24, we oversaw 
the remediation and repayment by suppliers 
of fees to workers who were discovered 
through audits to have paid recruitment fees.
Product Due Diligence
We believe AI will enhance human welfare 
and human rights in a myriad of ways.
NVIDIA is accelerating the AI revolution by 
creating platforms and computing tools 
that help developers, researchers, and 
data scientists innovate in these areas.
Human Rights Principles
We follow the laws of the countries in which we operate and endorse internationally 
recognized principles, including:
	
> International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights
	
> Core Conventions of the International 
Labour Organization
	
> ILO Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work
	
> United Nations Global Compact

U.N. Sustainable Development Goals 
We continue to align our business activities to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Here are a few ways we contributed to the SDGs in FY24. 
SDG
Our Support
Our Impact
Our employees’ well-being, physical, emotional, and financial health is a top priority, and we aim 
to support them by offering a suite of services where people can choose what works best for 
them. We partner with NVIDIA’s community resource groups to tailor support programs based 
on targeted needs, including gender affirmation support, enhanced health insurance coverage 
for members with developmental delays, and mental health counselor search tools.
NVIDIA launched more than two dozen new microservices that allow healthcare enterprises worldwide 
to take advantage of the latest advances in generative AI from anywhere and on any cloud. They offer 
advanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction, 
and simulation, accelerating transformation for healthcare companies as generative AI introduces 
numerous opportunities for pharmaceutical companies, doctors, and hospitals.
We continue to invest in entry-level feeder programs around the world, including the NVIDIA 
Ignite program that prepares first- and second- year college students for an NVIDIA internship 
the following summer. We implement tools to help us identify a wider pool of diverse talent in 
the student population, and our recruitment efforts in the U.S. attracted underrepresented 
applicants through virtual and on-campus events. 
Embodying the convergence of AI and academia, the University of Florida inaugurated the Malachowsky 
Hall for Data Science & Information Technology, marking a milestone in the partnership between UF alum 
and NVIDIA co-founder Chris Malachowsky, NVIDIA and the state of Florida—a collaboration that has 
propelled UF to the forefront of AI innovation.
NVIDIA continues to achieve pay parity, defined as no statistically significant differences in 
compensation based on gender, race, or ethnicity, for the past several years, and we plan to 
continue doing so. We offer comprehensive benefits programs worldwide, including full-cost 
reimbursement for eligible adoption, surrogacy, and fertility treatment expenses.
In FY24, five NVIDIANs were among 43 women honored by the Silicon Valley YWCA for excelling in their 
fields, making significant contributions in their executive and professional roles, and giving back to the 
community.
We believe AI should respect privacy and data protection regulations, operate in a secure and 
safe way, function in a transparent and accountable manner, and avoid unwanted biases and 
discrimination. Trustworthy AI principles are foundational to our end-to-end development and 
essential for the technical excellence that enables partners, customers, and developers to do 
their best work.
The U.S. National Science Foundation has launched the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource 
pilot program with significant support from NVIDIA. The initiative aims to broaden access to the tools 
needed to power responsible AI discovery and innovation, in partnership with 10 other federal agencies as 
well as private-sector, nonprofit, and philanthropic organizations.
To manage the GHG emissions footprint of our data centers, labs, and offices, we strategically 
focus on locating new sites, selecting facilities to expand, managing our operations efficiently, 
and sourcing renewable energy. Our current goal to source all global electricity use for offices 
and data centers under operational control from renewable energy is expected to result in zero 
scope 2 market-based emissions by the end of our fiscal year ending January 26, 2025.
The National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is testing AI models that provide granular, near-term 
forecasts of sunny and cloudy conditions over the UK’s solar panels. With better forecasts, ESO could 
cut down on the extra fossil fuel energy held as reserve—improving efficiency while decreasing carbon 
footprint.

About This Report
We welcome feedback on this report and our performance. Send comments and suggestions to 
NVIDIACorporateSustainability@nvidia.com.
The discussion of topics included in this report and our other corporate responsibility disclosures 
should not be read as implying that such topics are “material” in the context of the U.S. federal 
securities laws, Delaware General Corporation Law, or any other regulatory framework, even 
where we use words such as “material” or “materiality”. Our approach to sustainability disclosures 
is informed by reporting frameworks, such as the GRI, that involve broader definitions of 
materiality than used for purposes of our compliance with SEC disclosure obligations. As a result, 
“materiality” for purposes of our sustainability reporting includes impacts on communities, the 
environment, and stakeholders such as employees, customers, and suppliers, and the inclusion 
of topics in our sustainability reporting, even when described as “material,” does not indicate 
that such topics are material to the Company’s business, operations, or financial condition.
NVIDIA’s reporting follows our fiscal calendar, FY24 data corresponds to the period 
January 30, 2023, to January 28, 2024. The information contained in this report is accurate as 
of approximately May 24, 2024, unless stated otherwise. The information is subject to change, 
and NVIDIA will not necessarily disclose such changes. The information may be updated, 
amended, supplemented, or otherwise altered by subsequent reports or filings by NVIDIA. 
Certain statements included or incorporated by reference in this report, other than statements 
or characterizations of historical fact, including, but not limited to, statements as to: our 
growth; our market opportunities; the performance, impact, and benefits of our products 
and technologies; our strategies; our priorities, goals, and objectives; market trends; future 
forecasts; and other predictions and estimates are forward-looking statements and are 
based on our current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry and 
our management’s beliefs and assumptions. We caution readers that these statements 
are merely predictions and are not guarantees of future results. Actual events may differ 
materially, perhaps adversely. In particular, goals and targets described in this report are 
aspirational and not guarantees or promises that the goals or targets will be met.
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports 
on Form 8-K, and other filings made with the SEC discuss some of the important risk factors 
that could contribute to differences between projections and outcomes, which could affect 
our business, operational results, and financial condition. Except as required by law, NVIDIA 
does not recognize any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.
Historical and forward-looking statements contained in this report may be based on 
standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes 
that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. Such 
historical and forward- looking statements may be subject to measurement uncertainties 
resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such 
information and may include estimates or approximations. We believe that such estimates 
are appropriate and reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates 
and assumptions, actual results could differ from the original estimates. The precision of 
different measurement techniques may also vary. As we improve our methodologies and as new 
information becomes available, we may continue to revise our estimates and assumptions.
This report also includes certain information, including with respect to emissions factors, 
that is obtained from published sources or third parties. The accuracy and completeness of 
such information are not guaranteed. Such information is subject to assumptions, estimates 
and other uncertainties, and we have not independently verified this information.
