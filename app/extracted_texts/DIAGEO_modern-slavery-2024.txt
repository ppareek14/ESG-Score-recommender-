This statement describes the activities being undertaken by Diageo plc and its subsidiaries worldwide, including all subsidiaries incorporated in the United Kingdom, 
Australia, and Canada, (the Diageo Group) to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our business operations and supply chain.
This statement has been published and submitted on behalf of the Diageo Group by its parent company Diageo plc. This statement has been prepared in compliance 
with global modern slavery-related legislation including the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 2010, the Australian Modern 
Slavery Act 2018 and the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act of Canada 2024 (the Canadian Modern Slavery Act).
The Diageo Group has a common coordinated approach to human rights risk identification, risk assessments and due diligence taken to address human rights, 
including modern slavery risks.
 

What is Modern Slavery?
Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of 
fundamental human rights. Modern slavery takes 
various forms, including slavery, servitude, forced 
and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of 
which have in common the deprivation of a person’s 
liberty by another to exploit them for personal or 
commercial gain.
We know that modern slavery is a global issue and 
is linked in part to the rapid rise in global migration. 
It exists in every region in the world and in most types 
of economy, whether industrialised, developing, or 
transitional. No sector or industry can be considered 
immune or be complacent.
Diageo has a zero-tolerance approach to modern 
slavery. This statement describes what we are doing 
to prevent modern slavery in our business operations 
and our supply chain.

Our Supply Network
Around 29,000 direct suppliers from more than 100 
countries provide us with the raw materials, expertise 
and other resources that help us make great brands 
and products. All the products we make rely on high- 
quality agricultural raw materials and the people who 
grow them. Just a few key raw materials go into many 
of our well-known brands – from barley in Johnnie 
Walker and wheat in Smirnoff, to molasses in Captain 
Morgan and cream in Baileys.
These agricultural raw materials are drawn from 
farms all over the world, ranging from large, highly 
mechanised farms over thousands of hectares in 
Europe and the United States, to family-owned 
smallholdings in Africa which may be less than two 
hectares in size.
We recognise that different farm types and locations, 
involving a wide variety of types of employee 
(permanent, temporary, contract and seasonal), 
pose different risks in terms of modern slavery. We 
adapt our approach to assessing standards and 
managing issues accordingly, working with major 
international suppliers and, in some cases, directly 
with smallholder farmers.

Our Ambition
Diageo is a global leader in alcoholic beverages with an 
outstanding collection of over 200 brands across spirits 
and beer sold in nearly 180 countries, including Johnnie 
Walker, Crown Royal, JεB and Buchanan’s whiskies, 
Smirnoff, Cîroc and Ketel One vodkas, Captain Morgan, 
Baileys, Don Julio, Tanqueray and Guinness.
It is our ambition to be one of the best performing, most 
trusted and respected consumer products companies in 
the world. We know that we will only achieve this ambition 
if we conduct business sustainably and responsibly.
Diageo produces its brands from more than 100 
manufacturing sites globally and in fiscal year 24 we 
directly employed over 30,000 people around the 
world. Our partners employ many more, supporting our 
global manufacturing, distribution, sales, and marketing 
operations. We have interdependent relationships 
throughout our supply chain, from the farmers who grow 
our ingredients, to our employees and contractors, to the 
consumers who buy our brands. Throughout our extended 
value chain, from grain to glass, we are connected to 
many communities. We want to make sure that throughout 
that chain – wherever we live, work, source and sell – we 
are making a positive contribution.

Governance 
 
We are committed to act in line with the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and aim 
to embed respect for human rights into everyone’s working 
day, in every country throughout our business and value 
chain. Our policies set out responsibilities to protect the 
human rights of everyone working in our direct operations, 
our value chain, and communities.
Diageo plc’s Board of Directors is responsible for 
setting the company’s purpose, values, and strategy, 
and for ensuring that the company’s culture is aligned 
with these. Our Code of Business Conduct (our Code) 
and Human Rights Global Policy are an integral part 
of ensuring that Diageo’s culture is aligned with our 
purpose and values. Our Code is approved by our 
Board of Directors and our Human Rights Global 
Policy is approved by our Chief Executive. Our human 
rights strategy is reviewed on a periodic basis by the 
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by 
members of Diageo’s Executive Committee.
Responsibility for delivery is shared between the 
members of the Executive Committee that are 
responsible for establishing our approach on the 
human rights of our employees, suppliers, and 
communities. Our Executives, senior business leaders 
and functional specialists lead the agenda via our 
Global Human Rights Steering Group, and assess 
risks, emerging issues, compliance, and remediation 
within our enterprise risk management processes.

Introduction
Responsibility for day-to-day  
delivery of our Code  
and Human Rights Policy  
is every employee and  
partner’s responsibility.
Introduction
Local human rights risks are managed at our market 
Risk Management Committees. We believe that day- 
to-day delivery of our Code and Human Rights Global 
Policy is everybody’s responsibility.
Within our Procurement structure, a dedicated 
Responsible Sourcing team is in place to lead the 
management and implementation of our human 
rights commitment beyond our own operations. 
The team works closely with regional in-market 
Risk & Governance leads accountable for driving 
performance within their respective markets. This 
performance is reported through a tier process 
through Procurement and into the Human Rights 
Steering Group.
We measure the effectiveness of our human rights 
governance through our internal assurance framework 
and third-party human rights assessments, in addition 
to monitoring allegation and breach trends and root 
causes. We continue to enhance our risk mitigation 
plans based on lessons learned.
We support our employees to embed human rights in 
their work through an annual training plan including 
general awareness for all employees, as well as 
detailed training for functions directly related to 
managing human rights risks. We communicate our 
Code and Human Rights Global Policy throughout our 
business and, alongside our Partnering with Suppliers 
Standard, to our suppliers around the world. Our 
suppliers and agencies partners are also invited to 
training and engagement events such as our annual 
Pathway of Pride programme in Africa.
Our Reporting Suite
Reporting transparently on ESG issues helps us to  
manage risks, seize opportunities and promote sustainable 
development everywhere we live, work, source and sell
Within our Annual Report we present our most material 
disclosures and describe how our strategy delivers 
value for our business and our communities, using 
the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) 
Framework as a guide.
Our ESG Reporting Index is where we give 
additional disclosures in line with the GRI 
Standards index and includes our response  
to the Sustainability Accounting Standards 		
	
           Board (SASB).

DAL‘s Structure
DAL is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Diageo plc, 
its ultimate controlling parent company.
DAL is responsible for the marketing, sales and 
distribution of the Diageo Group’s brands and products 
in Australia. DAL has two subsidiaries, both based in 
Australia — most notably Bundaberg Distilling Company 
Pty Ltd (BDC) operating the Bundaberg Distillery — neither 
of these subsidiaries meets the definition set in section  
5 of the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 for  
reporting entities.
DAL’s Operations
Diageo has two manufacturing and logistics facilities in 
Australia, both directly owned or controlled by DAL:
	 Bundaberg Distillery is in Bundaberg East, 
Queensland and produces Bundaberg Rum and 
ReefTip Drinks Co. rum products. Bundaberg Distillery 
began its operations in 1888 and was bought by 
Diageo in 2000.
	 Huntingwood facility, is based in Western 
Sydney where a variety of spirits products, 
including full strength spirits and ready 
to drink products, is manufactured. This 
facility is also DAL’s distribution centre.
DAL and BDC are responsible for all aspects of these 
facilities, including hiring and remuneration of staff and 
contractors.
DAL’s head office is located in Sydney, New South Wales. 
It is responsible for marketing, innovation, commercial 
and corporate functions. DAL has small satellite office 
locations in Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth for 
sales teams, and employs approximately 430 employees 
in Australia as of fiscal year 24.
DCI’s structure
DCI is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Diageo plc, 
its ultimate controlling parent company.
DCI is responsible for the marketing, sales and distribution 
of the Diageo Group’s brands and products in Canada. 
DCI does not have any subsidiaries, though two of its 
affiliates (Diageo Ireland Quebec Distribution Inc. and 
Diageo Americas Supply Quebec Distribution Inc.) are 
also based in Canada but do not meet the requirements 
for reporting under the Canadian Modern Slavery Act.
DCI’s Operations
Diageo is a major producer of spirits in Canada, with the 
following three production facilities:
	 Gimli, Manitoba (distilling, maturing);
	 Amherstburg, Ontario (blending and bottling); and
	 Valleyfield, Quebec (distilling, maturing, blending, 
and bottling).
Construction of a fourth production facility (distilling and 
maturing) in St. Clair, Ontario has been announced and 
will be built in the coming years.
These facilities produce 12 million cases of spirits across 
over 200 SKUs every year. Canada is the home of 
Diageo’s Crown Royal Canadian Whisky.
DCI is responsible for all aspects of these facilities, 
including hiring and remuneration of staff and 
contractors.
DCI also has a beer distribution warehouse in 
Mississauga, Ontario. In Canada, DCI employs 
approximately 775 employees.

Our Approach 
 
We fully endorse and support the principles enshrined in 
the International Bill of Human Rights and the International 
Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work.
Diageo has an embedded policy framework that 
addresses human rights, and specifically the risk 
of modern slavery. This framework details our 
commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in 
all our business dealings, and to implementing and 
enforcing systems and controls to prevent modern 
slavery in our business and in our value chain. We  
are also committed to ensuring there is transparency 
in our approach to tackling modern slavery in our  
own business and throughout our value chain.
We expect these same high standards from all our 
contractors, suppliers, and business partners. We 
require our contractors and suppliers to comply with 
our policies and codes to combat the use of forced, 
compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in 
slavery or servitude, whether adults or children.  
We expect our suppliers in turn to cascade these

principles and hold their own suppliers to the same 
high standards. To that end, we monitor how our 
suppliers manage their supply chains through tools 
such as the Sedex Self-Assessment Questionnaire 
(SAQ), which includes a dedicated section on supply 
chain management practices. Additionally, we request 
that suppliers share their supplier code of conduct 
during the onboarding process through the Third-Party 
Risk Management (TPRM) system. For those suppliers 
deemed to be a high-risk, we deploy third-party audits 
(SMETA audit methodology) to support our suppliers 
progress in demonstrating compliance. See further 
details within the later section ’Supplier Assessments’.
We maintain regular contact and utilise several 
mechanisms to engage with our trading partners 
and seek assurance that they are committed to 
adopting best practice in relation to the rights 
of their workforce and contractors, aligning 
our approach with the UN Guiding Principles 
Human Rights Due Diligence Model.

Our Policies and Training 
Our policy framework addresses human rights, and 
specifically the risk of modern slavery, and is supported  
by on-going training programmes.
Our Policies
Our Code embodies our purpose and values. It sets out 
our collective and individual commitment to conducting 
business in accordance with them, and with all relevant 
laws, regulations, and industry requirements, as well as 
with a high standard of ethics and responsibility. Our 
Code also sets out our headline expectations on human 
rights, which are further detailed in our Human 
Rights Global Policy. Our Code is available in 
19 languages. You can read about our Code 
here. We review our Code periodically to ensure 
it remains in line with our policies (which are 
reviewed annually) and our business practices. We have 
taken the opportunity to ensure the language is as simple 
as possible for our employees to understand. Our Human 
Rights Global Policy details Diageo’s position on our core 
human rights principles: Health safety and wellbeing, 
harassment and bullying, discrimination, child labour, 
forced labour; wages and working time; freedom of 
association, water sanitation and hygiene and land rights.

Introduction
Our Partnering with Suppliers Standard sets out 
the minimum standards we require of our suppliers 
human rights, laws and regulations, bribery and 
corruption in respect of the wider sustainability 
aspirations we expect our suppliers to be working 
towards in areas such as inclusion and diversity, water 
stewardship and reductions in carbon emissions.
Our latest refresh in fiscal year 24 was benchmarked 
against the requirements set out within the Corporate 
Human Rights Benchmark, ensuring our suppliers are 
partnering with us against a consistently leading set  
of standards. 
We are committed to embedding a culture that 
encourages our people to freely raise concerns 
regarding potential or actual breaches of our 
Code, policies, or standard without retaliation, 
where we listen to what they say and then 
act upon compliance issues. Our Global  
Breach Management Standard gives clear 
direction on how we manage this response. Although 
this standard is globally applicable, local regulatory or 
legal requirements may take precedence.  
See further information here. 
9
Who these policies apply to
Our Code and Human Rights Global Policy apply to 
all of our employees worldwide regardless of their 
role or seniority, including those employed by Diageo 
subsidiary companies and joint ventures where 
Diageo has a controlling interest.
We also expect all our suppliers to adopt clear 
commitments on ethical business like those in our 
Code, and any party operating on Diageo’s behalf 
must ensure that their actions comply with our Code 
and global policies. We work with our suppliers to 
ensure they adhere to the contents of our Code and 
our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, including in 
some cases contractually committing to compliance. 
We have also included an ‘end-to-end responsibility’ 
statement in our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, 
setting out the expectation of our suppliers to 
promote the principles of the standard throughout 
their own supply chain, and to have the appropriate 
governance, due-diligence and reporting processes 
in place to verify and demonstrate applicable 
compliance standards.

Training on these policies
Diageo understands the importance of building 
compliance capability across our business, and  
we are working hard to engage our employees.
Our Code training is our way of ensuring that all 
employees fully understand what is expected of them 
and is delivered predominantly by e-Learning, with an 
integrated Annual Certification of Compliance (ACC) 
requirement. Annual Code training is mandatory and 
assigned to every employee in every market and covers 
all areas of our Code, with specific emphasis on key topics 
reinforced by scenario-based videos. Employees can 
complete it through e-Learning modules in their chosen 
language on their desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, 
with a face-to-face classroom training option delivered 
at sites where employees do not use computers. All new 
joiners are required to complete the training within 30  
days from their joining date.
Each market has its own training plan for key global 
policies, which they deliver through locally organised, risk- 
based training. We have strengthened our communication 
on good practice within markets and regions through 
delivery of annual engagement events such as Business 
Integrity days, where local teams and functions come 
together to learn more about current integrity and 
compliance issues and celebrate doing business the right 
way. We regularly review our training and communications 
material, and methods for delivery, to ensure they remain 
relevant to the risks our employees face in their roles.

Introduction
Through our ACC requirement, all employees at manager 
level and above certify that they understand what 
is expected of them. In fiscal year 24, the ACC was 
completed by 97% of eligible employees. Employees who 
did not complete the ACC on time were referred to HR for 
consequence management where appropriate, including 
coaching, written warnings and a requirement to complete 
the training.
We rolled out refreshed Code of Conduct training in 
September 2023 - Integrity at Diageo - focusing on 
impactful scenarios that bring to life real world integrity 
issues and questions employees face day-to-day, using 
storytelling and animated characters to highlight the role 
we all play in achieving our performance ambition.
We have also delivered training on our Human Rights 
Global Policy for teams directly responsible for its 
implementation (including our Business Integrity, Human 
Resources and Risk Management Committee teams) to 
build their capability in identifying and managing human 
rights risks. This helps us to be alert to these risks and 
enables us to act effectively when we see them.

Due Diligence: Direct operations
Focusing on salient human rights risks
In fiscal 24 we refreshed our assessment of salient risks 
that are most relevant to our business as specified in 
the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights 
at Work and the UNGPs. We looked at human rights 
benchmarks for our industry, priority commodities in 
our supply chain and the increasing interdependence 
between human rights and climate impacts. The 
assessment identified the following salient risks: 
health and safety, wages and benefits, working time, 
harassment and bullying, discrimination, freedom of 
association and collective bargaining, child labour, 
forced labour, water sanitation and hygiene and land 
rights. Whilst we conduct ongoing due diligence in all 
areas, we have prioritised health and safety, wages 
and benefits, working time, harassment and bullying 
and discrimination based on severity, likelihood, 
attribution, leverage and breach data.
Prioritising vulnerable groups
We recognise that some groups of people are 
more vulnerable to human rights breaches and 
pay particular attention to these groups within our 
risk assessments. Determined by human rights 
frameworks, our value chain, and human rights 
impact assessments, our vulnerable groups are 
women, ethnic minorities, persons with disabilities,  
the LGBTQIA+ community, indigenous peoples, 
migrant workers and contract/ temporary workers 
and children.

Introduction
Engaging our stakeholders
We recognise the importance of listening to and consulting 
stakeholders on issues that affect them. We do this on an 
ongoing basis through different mechanisms including 
worker interviews, reviewing grievance data, and holding 
community dialogues.
Risk assessment
We use a variety of risk assessment tools in our direct 
operations. This includes self-assessment questionnaires for 
all direct operations, third-party human rights assessments 
for high-risk direct operations and deep dive assessments 
for groups that we consider more vulnerable to risk. Where 
assessments identify material human rights concerns 
or suggest our approach can be strengthened to better 
identify and prevent risk, we strive to put in place robust 
action plans to resolve matters, working with external 
experts when appropriate.
Taking action to mitigate risk
Where we identify risk to our business and our people, we 
take action to mitigate it. For example:
	 Contract labour review, recognising contract workers 
as a more vulnerable group than direct employees. 
This reviewed the effectiveness of our governance 
processes as well as conducting interviews with 
contract workers to share their views. Based on the 
findings and recommendations, we will strengthen our 
processes to improve our governance over contract 
labour. For example, reviewing contractual clauses 
with labour providers, seeking evidence of supplier 
compliance, and including contract workers in our 
human rights assessments for direct operations.
	 Global Dignity at Work Policy which tackles 
harassment and bullying in the workplace, and our 
Domestic and Family Abuse guidelines supporting 
employees, their friends and family who may be 
experiencing harassment and bullying outside the 
workplace.
	 Global Brand Promoter standard and training which 
establishes principles and guidelines to protect brand 
promoters from the risk of sexual harassment.
	 Child labour prevention programme for smallholder 
farmers, where we have trained key functions and 
business partners in Africa to prevent child labour. 
We also deliver training directly to our smallholder 
farmers.
	 Partnership with external parties to assess and address 
the health impacts of heat stress in sugarcane farming 
for our rum supply through improved access to shade, 
drinking water, personal protective equipment, and 
rest schedules. 
	 Annual training for teams and suppliers within high- 
risk categories and locations so they can effectively 
manage human rights risks.

Whistleblowing and Breaches
Global Breach Management Standard details our 
response to managing allegations of breaches, and 
provides guidance to those involved in the process 
to ensure our investigations are handled fairly and 
effectively across all markets.
We encourage our people to report potential or actual 
breaches of our Code, global policies or standards 
through our confidential grievance and whistleblowing 
service, SpeakUp, which is available for all Diageo 
employees and business partners. The intake of new 
SpeakUps is supported by a company independent 
of Diageo and is available to employees and business 
partners, who can report matters in any language, 
anonymously or not. Once reported, the SpeakUp is 
managed by Diageo from start to finish.
Where appropriate, we share anonymous case 
studies of breaches of different areas of our Code with 
employees so that they can learn from them. Our goal 
is to ‘communicate what we can, where we can, as 
soon as we can’ with regard to closed breach cases, 
regardless of level, length of service and record of 
those involved. We share learnings from our Breach 
Management process in several ways including an 
Investigation Insights section available on our internal 
Business Integrity website, during training sessions and 
during our Global and market Business Integrity days.

Introduction
In fiscal year 24, no slavery, servitude, forced labour or 
compulsory labour issues were raised through SpeakUp. 
Regarding broader human rights and wellbeing-related 
issues, such as freedom of association, discrimination, 
health safety & wellbeing, working time and wages, 
88 allegations were raised. Of these, 17 matters were 
substantiated, and constituted 8 discrimination issues,  
3 health, safety, and wellbeing issues, and 6 working  
time issues. All cases were investigated, addressed,  
and remediated appropriately.
In fiscal year 24, we did not identify any instances of  
loss of income of vulnerable families as a result of the 
steps Diageo has taken to eliminate risks of forced  
labour or child labour, and remediation has therefore  
not been necessary.
To assist in ensuring we have an effective grievance 
mechanism for both our own employees and for workers 
in our supply chain, we have joined the Grievance 
Mechanism Activation Working Group through Aim-
Progress. Membership of this group helps us build 
and enhance our governance through improving the 
effectiveness of our grievance process and supporting 
potential victims of modern slavery, enabling them to

Due Diligence: Supply Chain
i. 	
Risk Assessment Screening
This map shows 15 of our priority sourcing categories 
from a human rights perspective and where they are 
being sourced from globally. The colour coding of each 
country is derived from third-party risk data that comes 
through Sedex an online platform used to manage and 
improve working conditions in global supply chains and 
help businesses source responsibly. The Sedex Radar 
risk assessment tool, is regularly updated and informed 
by a number of external sources that specialise in 
sustainability data, and enables us to prioritise further 
due diligence as an indicator of potential risk which 
looks at labour standards, health and safety, business 
ethics and environmental impact.
We have created overviews of identified salient 
human rights risks by region which includes Africa, 
North America, Latin America as well as Europe and 
Asia- Pacific. The risks identified here at country level 
have been determined as high priority for Diageo. This 
determination is based on the inherent risk level of the 
country from third-party data, data we have gathered 
from suppliers in that region and for the particular 
commodity based on previous risk assessments, our 
ability to mitigate the risk given the supply chain model 
and how connected we are to those stakeholders which 
are impacted.

ii. 	 Supply Chain Mapping
We continue to work with our supply partners to trace 
and map the value chain beyond tier one within 
our priority commodity supply chains. This helps us 
understand where risk may occur further upstream 
in the value chain and how we can influence and 
intervene on certain human rights issues. Within our 
priority raw material supply chains, we are tracing 
crops back to farm level, in packaging we’re looking 
at where our component materials are being extracted 
from and in marketing where merchandising material 
is being manufactured.
iii. 	Workforce Profile in the Supply Chain
Our supply chain operates across multiple regions. 
A significant portion is located in high-risk countries 
(based off third-party risk data received through the 
Radar tool in Sedex) such as India, Kenya, Nigeria, 
Mexico, Brazil, Turkey, among others. We are able 
to understand the profile of the workforce within our 
direct tier 1 supply chain through supplier assessments. 
The workforce of our high-risk suppliers (that have 
completed the Sedex SAQ in our supply chain  
consists of: 
Permanent Employees: 	
	
76%
Temporary employees: 	
	
13%

Introduction
According to site profile data from all suppliers we are 
linked to in Sedex, our supply chain workforce profile 
reports as 27% female and 73% male, of which 4.6%  
are migrants.
Migrants and subcontracted workers may face unique 
challenges. Therefore, as part of our due diligence 
process, we conduct targeted audits and engage directly 
with suppliers to ensure compliance with our standards.
iv. 	 Supplier Onboarding: Third-Party Risk 
Management
Our Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) programme 
allows us to manage human rights risks when onboarding 
new suppliers against a set criteria mapped to our 
Partnering with Suppliers Standard. The Human Rights 
risk assessment involves screening of suppliers to provide 
an initial risk level. These suppliers are then required to 
answer questions and demonstrate evidence related to 
their working practices and policies focused on key risk 
areas, such as harassment, discrimination, forced labour, 
child labour, and working hours. If gaps or potential risk 
areas are identified, then suppliers are asked to take 
corrective actions that are then monitored and tracked to 
closure.
In fiscal year 24, 5,499 suppliers 15 % of Active Supplier 
Base of 34,600 suppliers were assessed through the TPRM 
programme.
 
5499 suppliers risk assessed

DAL’s supply chains
For this reporting period, DAL sourced direct and indirect 
materials and services from approximately 321 suppliers.
Local Australian production relies on raw materials 
and packaging largely sourced from Australian based 
suppliers. In this reporting period, 96% of suppliers 
(including of raw materials, such as molasses, sugar, 
neutral alcohol, of packaging materials such as glass,cans, 
closures and paper products, and logistics services) were 
locally sourced. Materials sourced internationally (including 
flavours, bulk spirit, glass bottles and equipment) were 
imported from established suppliers operating in countries 
such as the United Kingdom, within Europe, and China.
DCI’s supply chains
For this reporting period, DCI sourced direct and indirect 
materials and services from approximately 638 suppliers. 
Local Canadian production relies on raw materials and 
packaging largely sourced from Canadian based suppliers.
In this reporting period, 79% of suppliers (including of 
raw materials, such as rye and corn, packaging materials 
such as glass and plastic, logistics services and general 
contractors) were locally sourced. Materials sourced 
internationally (including rum) were imported from 
established suppliers operating in countries from within the 
Caribbean, China, within Europe and the United States.
We recognise, that notwithstanding robust global 
procurement policies, this does not automatically prevent 
risks to labour standards or modern slavery, irrespective of 
the nature and location of suppliers, and we monitor and 
assess suppliers against international standards and our 
own Partnering with Suppliers standard.
Where assessments identified human rights 
concerns or suggest our approach can be 
strengthened to better identify and prevent 
risk, we put in place robust action plans to 
resolve matters

Introduction
DAL Human Rights 
Risk Assessment
In 2019, a detailed Human Rights Impact Assessment 
(HRIA) was undertaken in DAL. The assessment 
focused on DAL’s own manufacturing and logistics 
operations, raw material suppliers (sugar cane), 
manufacturing suppliers (glass), and sales and 
marketing (own operations and sales agency).
The HRIA found that DAL’s operations are generally 
well-managed with good implementation of robust 
policies, aided by Australia’s highly regulated 
labour market, which minimises risks of labour 
rights violations. The assessment did uncover 
potential risks around supply chain management, 
supply chain visibility, and working conditions.
DAL’s operations are working to continue compliance 
with Australian labour laws, and continue to 
engage casual workers correctly, including correct 
identification of casual employees entitled to continual 
employment. Modern Slavery Act compliance 
clauses have been added into supplier contracts to 
supplement human rights clauses already referenced 
in the Partnering with Suppliers standard.
DAL’s country risk data is provided through the Sedex 
Radar Tool and indicates Australia to be a low-risk region. 
This should be considered in the context of Diageo 
operating in nearly 180 countries and with supply chains 
in many countries with higher levels of modern slavery 
risks than Australia. However, the HRIA carried out in 
Australia, identified Australia’s agricultural supply chain, 
and manufacturing suppliers from China and Indonesia as 
potential risks for forced labour or modern slavery. Potential 
harassment of staff promoting DAL products was also 
identified as a potential human rights risk. These are risks 
common to other parts of Diageo’s business and are being 
addressed on a global basis as set out in this statement.
To ensure we stay alert to emerging risks, in the fiscal 
year 24 we completed SAQs for DAL’s direct operations. 
The results of the SAQs were analysed by the Risk 
Management Committee and where the assessments 
identified any material human rights concerns or 
suggested our approach can be strengthened to 
better identify and prevent risk, we will strive to put 
in place robust action plans to resolve matters, 
working with external experts when appropriate.
DCI Human Rights 
Impact Assessment 
In 2019 we completed a detailed HRIA in North America, 
including in Canada. The assessment focused on Diageo’s 
manufacturing operations in Ontario, Canada, interviewing 
staff and workers as well as key suppliers. Site visits were 
complemented with phone interviews.
The HRIA found that human resources is well managed, 
robust health and safety procedures are in place, women 
are well represented, and significant improvements have 
been made on worker-management relationships. The 
assessment did uncover that communication between 
management and workers can be challenging, training is 
limited to new workers and oversight of labour and working 
conditions of key business partners and contractors could  
be improved.
DCI’s country risk data is provided through the Sedex  
Radar Tool and indicates Canada to be a low-risk region. 
This should be considered in the context of Diageo  
operating in nearly 180 countries and with supply chains  
in many countries with higher levels of modern slavery  
risks than Canada.
To ensure we stay alert to emerging risks, in the fiscal 
year 24 we completed SAQs for our direct operations in 
Canada. The results of the SAQs were analysed by the 
Risk Management Committee and where the assessments 
identified any material human rights concerns or suggested 
our approach can be strengthened to better identify and 
prevent risk, we will strive to put in place robust action  
plans to resolve matters, working with external experts  
when appropriate.

v.	 Supplier Prioritisation: Salient Human Rights 
Assessment
Understanding where our salient risks sit across our 
full value chain allows us to prioritise our actions 
beyond our first tier and enables us to drive social 
impact where it is needed most. We have worked to 
establish best-practice processes for the identification, 
management, reporting and remediation of human 
rights issues, with focus on integrating the UNGPs in 
our approach.
We have worked through 15 prioritised supply chains 
and across 15 human rights issue areas. These were 
then scored on their attribution to Diageo and our 
leverage to address and remediate each of the issues 
in each of the particular supply chains. These findings 
allow us to focus on particular regions where we’re 
sourcing certain products and services from, either 
directly or through our supply chain partners. It allows 
us to focus and address particular issues and use due- 
diligence tools which are designed to identify specific 
human rights issues.
Methodology: According to the UNGPs, the saliency of 
a human rights issue is determined by its significance 
and importance to stakeholders who may be affected 
by company’s activities. Using the below framework 
of defining saliency scores, we are able to identify and 
prioritise human rights issues based on their potential 
severity as well as likelihood.
 
Severity
Likelihood
(probability of 
occurring in the future, 
recognising that these 
are often, though 
not limited to, those 
impacts that have 
occurred in the past)
Scope
(the number of 
individuals that are or 
could be affected)
Scale
(the gravity of the 
impact on the human 
right(s))
Remediability
(the ease with which 
those impacted could 
be restored to their 
prior enjoyment of the 
right(s))
1 - Low
Limited number of 
rightsholders could  
be affected
Could have a limited 
detrimental impact 
on physical or mental 
health & wellbeing
The impact can be 
easily remediated
Unlikely - there is low/
no inherent risk and/
or controls are not in 
place to mitigate
     2 - Medium
Moderate number of 
rightsholders could  
be affected
Could have a serious 
detrimental impact 
on physical or mental 
health & wellbeing
The impact can be 
remediated but would 
require significant 
resource or time
Likely - there is some 
inherent risk and/or 
no or limited controls 
are in place to 
mitigate
3 - High
Large number of 
rightsholders could be 
affected (potentially 
in multiple tiers of the 
supply chain)
Could result in death
It’s possible the 
impact cannot be 
remediated 
Very likely - there 
is high inherent risk 
and/or controls to 
mitigate are limited  
or not in place
We are also factoring in our response to adverse human rights 
impacts when we consider our prioritisation criteria. This is 
determined according to attribution of impacts (i.e. the extent to 
which Diageo has ‘caused’, ‘contributed to’ or is ‘directly linked 
to’ the impact) and our leverage in addressing the impact.

vi. Supplier Assessments 
We manage social and ethical risks in our supply chain 
through our Responsible Sourcing programme, which 
is embedded across our procurement function. Our 
programme starts with our Partnering with Suppliers 
standard, which sets out our commitment to acting 
in accordance with the UNGPs and the international 
standards set out by the eight core ILO conventions and 
recommendations.
Our programme follows a risk-based approach to 
assessing adherence to our Partnering with Suppliers 
standard. Suppliers are risk-assessed against the following 
three criteria: location of supplier site, category of product 
or service and spend. Suppliers assessed as potential risk 
are required to register with Sedex and complete a SAQ. 
Suppliers who are assessed as high risk are also required 
to undertake an independent third-party Sedex Members 
Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) or an equivalent four-
pillar ethical audit. As of the end of fiscal year 24, 1,078 
suppliers have completed the latest version of the SAQ in 
Sedex. This is one of several Responsible Sourcing factors 
internally monitored at a market and global level.
Our ethical audit programme of suppliers remains a key 
part of our due diligence process to identify and manage 
ethical risks in our supply chain, including modern slavery. 
Suppliers are independently audited against the SMETA 
Four Pillar Audit Protocol or equivalent. These audits are 
carried out by independent third-party audit bodies which 
are qualified by Sedex as Affiliate Audit Companies 
and member of the Association of Professional Social 
Compliance Auditors. During fiscal year 24, we have 421 
such suppliers, of whom 323 (77%) were independently 
audited during the last three years (audits are valid 
for three years); Some of our supplier audits will be 
accessed through the mutual recognition work stream 
within our stakeholder network Aim-Progress, including 
unannounced, semi announced and fully scheduled 
audits thereby reducing audit burden that allows suppliers 
to instead focus on continuous improvement of working 
conditions.
2,301 issues of non-compliance have been raised during 
fiscal year 24 through these audits, with 51% relating to 
health, safety, and hygiene issues, 11% relating to working 
hours; 10% to wages and benefits; 7% to management 
systems and the remaining 21% to other categories. 
We work closely with our supply chain partners on the 
Corrective Action Plans in place and following these up 
to closure. Where required, we are arranging follow- 
up audits to verify the issues have been identified and 
resolved.
A breakdown of our non-compliance 
findings in our supply chain by issue 
category can be found in our 2024 ESG 
Reporting Index, within the Social section 
(pg56).
Benefits and insurance: 37%
Records keeping: 27%

vii. Enhanced Due-Diligence and Remediation 
Our enhanced due diligence process follows a 4-step 
approach (Identify > Integrate > Track > Report) as per the 
UNGPs. This allows us to review priority human rights issues 
for suppliers within a specific category and deploy the most 
effective due-diligence tool which includes the entire value 
chain. Our enhanced due diligence approach considers five 
categories across supplier assessment, supplier capability 
building and incentives, stakeholder engagement, supply 
chain transparency and collaboration.
Once we understand the detail of the risks occurring, we 
deploy a formalised remediation process for breaches in our 
supply chains, again following a 4-step approach (Identify> 
Investigate > Remediate > Monitor) aligned with the Ethical 
Trading Initiative and the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) framework. This 
framework allows us to determine for each human rights 
breach whether and the extent to which Diageo’s supply chain 
operations have caused, contributed, or are linked to the 
issue. How we provide remedy is context-dependent, but our 
aim is to restore individuals or groups that have been harmed 
by business activity to the situation they would have been 
in had the impact not occurred. We would consider various 
options of remediation including financial compensation, 
rehabilitation, restitution, apology, punitive sanctions and 
guarantees of non-repetition.

We are also involved in programmes such as building 
supply chain capability so that organisations and their 
suppliers are competent in executing robust responsible 
sourcing programmes, developing common evaluation 
methodologies, and also shared tools including a deep 
dive on living wages. Aim-Progress has developed a 
regional strategy to extend the reach and scale of support 
and impacts for global members, including Diageo, and 
we are active members of both the Africa and APAC 
regional hubs. Through these hubs, we are working with 
other existing members to address the most salient human 
rights and responsible sourcing issues across Africa and 
APAC, with the intention to provide direct supplier training 
and capability building, as well as providing a platform 
to pilot new tools and methodologies that support the 
promotion of human rights and collective mitigation of 
modern slavery risks.
 
Case Study: Protecting Workers in a Changing Climate
We are working with the non-governmental 
organisation La Isla Network and our rum supply 
chains on an intervention programme to help protect 
workers from the impacts of climate change on working 
conditions. This project, piloting in Jamaica and 
Guatemala, is designed to educate stakeholders while 
assessing their current practices and engaging with 
workers directly. We are implementing improvements 
to assure occupational safety and health risks are 
addressed, including heat stress and subsequent 
kidney injury and other poor outcomes for sugarcane 
workers due to exposure to extreme temperatures 
and working in harsh conditions. As well as improving 
health conditions for workers and reducing the risk 
of forced labour for these workers, this programme 
addresses the knock-on effects of child labour which 
occurs when workers are removed from the workforce 
due to unaddressed occupational safety and health 
risks resulting in minors leaving school and taking their 
place in the workforce, thereby increasing their own risk 
of occupational illness and injury.
We’ve partnered with La Isla Network members 
who are epidemiologists, to measure the level of 
exposure workers have to heat stress. This is done 
through measuring heart rates, metabolic loads, air 
temperature, humidity levels and wind speed amongst 
other metrics.
We aim to build a global approach to adaptable 
occupational safety and health programmes in the 
sugar industry and beyond utilising comparable 
protocols that allow the demonstration of global impact 
with reliable metrics. We believe collaborating and 
working together to create tangible solutions to
the challenges this sector is facing is key to protecting 
workers and managing the effects of climate change 
on their human rights.
In 2024 we were granted funding through the Bonsucro 
Impact Fund to support the extension of this project to 
the rest of our molasses supply chain in the Dominican 
Republic and Barbados. This funding enhances our 
ability to implement targeted interventions focusing  
on improving labour conditions and preventing  
forced labour.

Our Employees
Key employees in Procurement and Sustainability Key 
employees in Procurement and Sustainability who have 
direct responsibility for our Human Rights, Responsible 
Sourcing or Supply Governance programmes are required 
to be trained on modern slavery, with external input to 
build awareness of possible risks in key geographies and 
supply networks. Our training is designed both to educate 
employees on the principles of human rights – with a 
specific emphasis on modern slavery – and to empower 
staff to recognise the potential signs of forced labour 
occurring and the mechanisms they could utilise  
to challenge these practices and intervene. Training is 
rolled out to both Procurement staff and a selection of  
key stakeholder and influencing functions within Diageo.
During fiscal year 24, we focused on upskilling business 
leaders across the breadth of ESG relating to Spirit of 
Progress, to educate and empower leaders in partnership 
with the Saïd Business School at the University of 
Oxford. Nearly 520 of these leaders completed the 
course and 95% reported that they were equipped 
to think and act differently following the course. 
We also provide training to our Procurement teams on our 
Responsible Sourcing programme and our Partnering with 
Suppliers Standard, which includes guidance on how we 
manage human rights and labour standard risks within 
our supply chain. All Category Managers have access to 
our internal Responsible Sourcing Toolkit, which provides 
detailed end-to-end guidance on taking suppliers through 
each step of the responsible sourcing journey. We also 
have a Responsible Sourcing Toolkit guide for suppliers 
hosted on the Diageo Suppliers Service Hub. Both the 
internal and external toolkits remain live documents which 
are regularly updated with the latest information relating to 
our responsible sourcing programme.
Our Procurement Category Managers have also been 
trained on the OECD guidelines for identifying and 
managing salient human rights risks in their respective 
supply chain categories. The training looked at what risks 
occur within the sourcing regions linked to their category, 
how to conduct further due diligence relevant to their 
area, remediation of any identified risks and finally how to 
track and communicate the impact of this activity. This has 
been developed into an internal e-Learning module for 
continued use globally. 
For our supply sites specifically, we provide Security 
Standards and Awareness training to ensure the integrity 
of our supply chain and to reduce the risk of human 
trafficking.

Our Supply Chain Partners
Diageo is committed to supporting capability building 
in our supply chain, particularly where it is aimed at 
increasing awareness of modern slavery risks and their 
indicators. We have developed an online learning module 
for our suppliers with the objective of upskilling them 
on human rights issues that may take place within their 
own operations and their supply chain, so that they are 
sufficiently prepared to be able to identify and mitigate 
potential and actual human rights risks. The online module 
contains scenarios and proposes different methods of 
response to identify salient human rights risks, conducting 
further due diligence and options for remediation and 
was rolled out in fiscal year 24 to 45 suppliers from 15 high 
priority categories (including Raw Materials, Packaging, 
Logistics and Indirects) nominated based on their 
geographical risk and spend. Approximately 25 suppliers 
have thus far managed to complete the online module 
successfully.  
 
As well as producing online learning content, we have 
also collaborated on several in-person training activities 
during fiscal year 24. In May and June 2024, as part 
of our wider programme to improve the economic and 
social resilience of our smallholder farmers, we rolled 
out child labour awareness training for our smallholder 
farmers in Kenya and Ghana. In Kenya we trained 
4,000 farmers and in Ghana 11,490. The training was 
delivered through a Train-the-Trainer model to then 
reach our smallholder farmers based on the Child 
Protection Toolkit we previously developed in partnership 
with The Coca-Cola Company and ABInBev. We 
will continue to refresh this training and expand the 
scope of delivery to other regions in fiscal year 25.
 
Diageo are members of Aim-Progress, a stakeholder 
initiative for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) 
sector on responsible sourcing. Through our membership 
of Aim-Progress, we play an active role in the regional 
hubs within Africa and Asia Pacific. These regional hubs 
provide training programmes on key issues relating to 
modern slavery which member companies from across the 
FMCG community can invite their suppliers to. During fiscal 
year 24 we partnered with several other FMCG companies 
and with our suppliers who joined a number of in-person 
and virtual training sessions on modern slavery. In Kenya 
the training covered gender and sexual harassment, 
grievance mechanisms, regenerative agriculture, and 
workforce casualisation.  
 
In India the focus was on Human rights and environmental 
due diligence legislation, improving wages, protecting 
contract and migrant workers, effective use of audits and 
implementing robust grievance mechanics. In Malaysia 
the emphasis was on protecting migrant workers and 
promoting responsible purchasing practices. In the United 
States we co-funded training programmes, utilising a mix 
of live webinars and e-learning, aimed at identifying and

Diageo uses various methods of assessing the effectiveness 
of the actions taken to assess and address modern slavery 
risks. We are continually reviewing our approaches both 
through internal and external measures to ensure the risk of 
exploitation in our operations and supply chain is reduced 
through our practices. We regularly assess the effectiveness 
of our overall programme against international requirements 
in the UNGPs and OECD Guidelines.
Diageo takes several approaches to reviewing our risk and 
controls environment, which are also reported up to our 
Executive’s risk management bodies, such as the Audit and 
Risk Committee, and to the Audit Committee of the Board of 
Diageo plc, and include:
	 Global governance of modern slavery is managed 
through our Human Rights Steering Group. This group 
reviews the effectiveness of our practices across the 
business including our own operations, our supply 
chain and how we work comply with global legislation. 
Our Global Procurement Function has an embedded 
governance process to oversee the global supply 
base including using risk management dashboards, 
reviewed monthly by our leaders across all countries 
and markets concerning modern slavery risks. The 
performance of our procurement professionals and 
leaders is monitored through a balanced scorecard of 
key performance indicators reviewed each month,

and a component directly focusses on mitigation of 
modern slavery risks to ensure we drive prompt action 
and remediation where necessary. In addition, we 
have invested in dedicated Global and Local Risk and 
Governance Procurement Management resources and 
Business Integrity resources that monitor our performance 
across all markets. Responsible Sourcing (including how 
we manage Modern Slavery risks) is part of our company 
set of business controls.
	 Our Human Rights and Responsible Sourcing 
Controls measure compliance and are tested as part 
of our Diageo annual testing cycle. This involves a 
process by a team outside the Global Procurement 
organisation to test performance impartially. As 
part of this cycle, we have a measurement in place 
to ensure leaders are focussed on reducing control 
failures and net deficiencies. Functional performance 
on net deficiencies is reported up to our Audit 
and Risk Committee and ultimately to the Audit 
Committee of the Board of Diageo plc.
	 Diageo’s internal audit team periodically audits our 
human rights programme for our own sites and our 
Responsible Sourcing methodology and approach. 
Our most recent internal audit of Responsible 
Sourcing took place in April 2024, where the end-to-
end process of onboarding suppliers through
to improving their capability was assessed, with 
recommendations on how to optimise the process for 
human rights risk management. During our most recent 
internal audit, recommendations for improvement were 
made linked to our escalation process for non-compliant 
suppliers, how we manage assessments for warehousing 
suppliers and gathering more accurate site location data. 
In addition, from time to time, our external auditor may 
perform global or country audits of our approach. We 
review how our Responsible Sourcing audit programme 
is progressing through time. In fiscal year 24 over 77% of 
all instances of non-compliance raised during the year 
(2,301) have been closed, impacting 66,932 workers from 
244 sites. We are following up with the relevant suppliers 
through corrective action plans and are working together 
to resolve all remaining open issues.

Introduction
Our programmes provide a solid platform to continue progress 
in identifying and reducing the risk of modern slavery in our 
business and value chain. Our Human Rights and Responsible 
Sourcing programmes have helped us identify and focus on 
higher-risk areas within our operations and the full value chain, 
and to instigate remedial and improvement actions.
Within Responsible Sourcing we will utilise our salient 
risks framework to ensure we prioritise our action based 
on the OECD guidelines of positively impacting the most 
vulnerable stakeholders. We are also integrating our work 
on carbon, water, and nature to measure and manage 
the impact on people. As we roll-out more regenerative 
agriculture programmes in our supply chain, we will look 
to combine how we work with farmers on improved soil 
health and carbon reduction with a particular focus on 
modern slavery within our raw material supply chains  
and particularly with smallholder farmers.
The key risks we have identified will be the focus of further 
work, as we strengthen child protection, contract labour 
standards, and our work to tackle sexual harassment in 
the hospitality industry, whilst also building awareness and 
capability within our supplier network through training and 
engagement programmes. Furthermore, we will continue 
to embed our human rights approach across our global 
functions, markets and corporate risk management tools 
so that we can regularly assess and address human rights 
risks following our initial assessments, as well as monitor 
the effectiveness of the remedial actions taken.
We recognise there can be a heightened risk of modern 
slavery in some emerging markets where we make 
acquisitions. We will continue to apply our programmes 
across all markets, implementing them for acquisitions 
and their associated supply chains. Any newly acquired 
operations are incorporated into our global drive to 
enable all our companies and their suppliers to meet 
Diageo’s high standards in all areas of governance and 
compliance, including in the fields of human rights and 
modern slavery.

Introduction
Worker Voice
As part of our ongoing commitment to enhancing labour 
rights in our supply chain, we are integrating worker 
voice as a key assessment tool to gather direct insights 
into working conditions in areas where we currently 
have limited visibility. The project focuses on four priority 
categories — agave, grapes, transportation, and facilities 
management — partnering with three strategic suppliers 
in each category. Through surveys, interviews, and digital 
engagement with workers, we will gather real-time data to 
assess working conditions, better understand workers well- 
being and identify potential risks to improve our supply 
chain practices.
The target audience for this initiative includes both 
permanent and temporary workers involved in those 
supply chains part of the project.
Staying ahead of emerging legal requirements and 
increasing stakeholder expectations 
We continue to monitor new regulations, including the 
EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and 
in fiscal year 24, took preparatory steps in anticipation 
of this regulation. We have refreshed our list of salient 
risks, vulnerable groups, high risk markets and high-risk 
commodities in our supply chain. We have implemented 
new risk assessment tools for our direct operations and 
supply chain that allow us to better detect and mitigate 
risk before an incident occurs. We are in the process of 
expanding our human rights due diligence further along 
our value chain – incorporating new businesses, brand 
promoters, third-party operations, suppliers’, stakeholders, 
and our customers.

3 	 Launch of our Human Rights Impact 
Assessment (HRIA) programme, a 
systematic review of business activity and 
human rights due diligence approach 
to identify and assess potential human 
rights impacts, including modern slavery 
risks. Our assessments involve detailed 
examination of our value chain, from raw 
material sourcing to manufacturing units 
where we procure our glass, labels, caps, 
and other items, to our own production 
operations, and to the retailers and bars 
selling our products.

our supply chains at scale. 
1 	 Our first HRIA was completed  
in Kenya.
2 	 Our HRIA business toolkit was 
established. This guides our markets 
through a systematic review of their 
businesses to identify and assess 
potential human rights impacts, 
including modern slavery risks.
.
3 	 Key employees in Procurement 
and Sustainability who have direct 
responsibility for our Human Rights, 
Responsible Sourcing or Supply 
Governance programmes were first 
trained on human trafficking and 
modern slavery, with external input 
to build awareness of possible risks in 
key geographies and supply networks. 
This training was refreshed in 2019 
and again in 2020.
