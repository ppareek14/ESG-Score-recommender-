Our progress toward our SDT will continue to be influenced by market conditions, public policy, and technological advancement, and as such, we do 
not expect our progress to be linear. In line with the Firm’s approach for the rest of our business, we do not manage the SDT focused on      
short-term results, but rather, focused on positioning ourselves to drive long-term progress

The Energy Mix target recognizes that a singular focus on fossil fuels will not 
achieve the necessary transition of the global energy system
Factors that Impact Progress Toward Target
Energy Mix Target
Previous Oil & Gas End Use Target
Oil & Gas End Use (Scope 3) Carbon 
Intensity
Decrease in portfolio weighted-
average carbon intensity of Oil & Gas 
clients
Increase in portfolio weighted-average 
carbon intensity of Oil & Gas clients
Oil & Gas Financing
Decrease in financing provided to Oil 
& Gas clients
Increase in financing provided to Oil & 
Gas clients
Zero-Carbon Power Financing
Increase in financing of zero-carbon 
power activities
Decrease in financing of zero-carbon 
power activities
Environmental
Understanding Absolute Emissions Disclosure for Our Energy Mix Portfolio
To provide transparency and insight into the emissions footprint of our financing to the Oil & Gas sector, we disclosed our absolute financed and facilitated emissions covering 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 for upstream, refining, and integrated companies
Our reported absolute financed and facilitated emissions for our Energy Mix portfolio correspond to the end-use (Scope 3) emissions from Oil & Gas clients
Electric Power clients within our Energy Mix portfolio do not contribute to our absolute financed and facilitated emissions, as zero-carbon power generation leads to no end-use 
emissions
We expanded the boundary of our Oil & Gas End Use (Scope 3) target — now called Energy Mix — to include zero-carbon power 
generation activity from our Electric Power portfolio, which is intended to better capture how our financing helps to facilitate the 
diversification of energy sources by supporting the development of zero- and low-carbon alternatives
The Energy Mix target provides us with a more comprehensive view of the energy system and increases the factors that can impact 
progress toward this target compared to our previous approach

Our corporate governance practices are designed to serve the diverse interests of 
our stakeholders and communities we operate in
An important component of risk management at JPMorgan Chase is assessing our clients’ approach to, and performance on, E&S 
matters. Failing to appropriately manage E&S risks can impact our clients’ operations and long-term economic viability, increase
scrutiny from our investors, employees, and regulators, and impact the environment and communities across the world. Where 
relevant, we consider a range of internationally recognized principles to inform our approach in managing certain E&S risks
Managing 
Environmental 
and Social Risks
The Firm’s political engagement and public policy activities are managed by Global Government Relations, which helps us focus
the Firm’s political engagement efforts on those public policy issues most relevant to the long-term interests of the Firm overall 
and to our clients and shareholders. Because of our policies and practices, we received a “Trendsetter” ranking in 2023, with an
overall score of 97.1%, by the Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability (CPA)-Zicklin Index
Political, Public 
Policy & Industry 
Engagement
Our Firm has a range of stakeholders, including customers and clients, investors, employees, communities, regulators and 
policymakers, suppliers and research analysts. We engage with these stakeholders throughout the year to obtain insight into their 
needs and perspectives, and to gather feedback on our strategy and performance, including as they relate to ESG matters
Stakeholder 
engagement
We acknowledge that our business has the potential to impact surrounding communities and the environment; as such, it is 
important that we consider human rights issues when making business decisions. While national governments bear primary 
responsibility to protect the human rights of their citizens, including their safety and security, we strive to respect and promote 
human rights with our employees, suppliers and clients
Human Rights 
The risk of cyber-attacks and other threats to information security continues to evolve and grow. In addition, the individuals with 
whom the Firm interacts expect that our data practices are safe and lawful. Data privacy and cybersecurity therefore remain top 
priorities for our Firm
Data Privacy & 
Cyber Security
We strive to be accountable, straightforward and honest in our dealings with customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and 
other stakeholders. Our Code of Conduct, Business Principles, and other internal policies and procedures are designed to 
promote a culture of respect that allows every employee to feel safe at work and empowered to speak up if they have concerns 
about unethical behavior
Business Ethics
Governance
Responsibility for oversight and management of ESG occurs at multiple levels within the organization. The Board’s core areas of 
oversight include strategy, executive performance, talent management and succession planning, financial performance and 
condition, risk management and internal control framework and on ESG matters. Senior management within each of our lines of 
business are responsible for driving strategy and execution, including relating to ESG matters where applicable, across the Firm
