GRI Index 
This index outlines our response to the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards
Our definition of material is relatively broad and includes issues that surfaced as part of our materiality assessment, regardless of priority, as 
illustrated on page 3. We have reported on as many standards as possible, against the priorities set by our materiality review. We continue to 
report against the most recent versions of the GRI Standards, staying true to our philosophy of reporting in a transparent manner to global 
standards of best practice on a range of economic, environmental and social impacts.
Translating our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan to GRI
In addition to informing our strategy, our materiality assessment guides our reporting and has helped us determine which issues to address in 
our Annual Report, on our website and in our ESG Reporting Index, so as to be most informative for our stakeholders. The following table maps 
our activities and programmes against the GRI Standards.

Our response
1-1
Accuracy
We clearly, consistently and transparently report our performance against our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan 
on pages 48-74 of our Annual Report.
We explain our methodology for calculating performance against targets in the Reporting boundaries 
and methodologies section of this ESG Reporting Index. PwC was engaged to provide independent 
limited assurance over selected information in our Annual Report and in this ESG Reporting Index for 
the year ended 30 June 2024.
1-2
Balance
We report against stretching targets and GRI indicators, whether or not our performance has been 
strong. This gives a balanced view of the impacts we make, which we have defined by considering the 
views of a range of stakeholders.
We aim to present information in such a way that readers can assess trends in performance year 
on year.
1-3
Clarity
Our ESG information is described at a high level on our website, with examples to bring our strategy to 
life. We identify and report on the most material issues in our Annual Report. And we have produced 
this ESG Reporting Index to make sure our readers can find all the information they seek, including our 
responses to all GRI Standards.
1-4
Comparability
We have designed our Annual Report and this ESG Reporting Index to enable stakeholders to easily 
review our performance over time, and to help readers find comparable information to other 
companies by following generally accepted reporting frameworks, such as GRI and the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol). Where we have differed from the methodology described in those 
standards, we have transparently reported on those differences in our Reporting boundaries and 
methodologies section.
1-5
Completeness
Our coverage of material topics is explained in the Material topics section on page 20 and the scope of 
our performance indicators are outlined in the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on 
pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index. 
1-6
Sustainability context
Our Annual Report explains the wider context in which we operate and presents our sustainability 
performance in relation to both our corporate performance and global sustainable development issues, 
including the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
Our Annual Report also presents how our material issues – that is, economic, environmental and social 
issues – relate to our long-term strategy, risks, opportunities and goals, including throughout our 
value chain.
1-7
Timeliness
We continue to publish this ESG Reporting Index alongside the Annual Report.
1-8
Verifiability
Our reporting methodologies for non-financial information can be found on pages 94-116 of this ESG 
Reporting Index. In some cases, our data and processes are assured by third parties.
Information on effective risk management, control environment and internal controls can be found on 
pages 77-85 of Annual Report.

those employees whose contract is not fixed-term or temporary. Part-time is defined as an employee not working at 100% of a full-time 
equivalent. 
Information about our total workforce by employees and supervised workers, and by gender, is included in

Our response

Workers who are not 
employees 
Our extended workers cover engagements which are required to be resourced at speed and where there 
is no requirement to commit to a fixed staffing cost. This includes short-term capacity challenges, specialist 
expertise/resource, deliverables, commercials, and knowledge transfer to Diageo that addresses a 
particular business issue, opportunity or requirement. The resource is either employed by a staffing 
agency and placed on assignment with us where Diageo is responsible for the day-to-day direction of 
work, or as an independent contractor whose work is based on pre-agreed milestones and not under the 
direction of Diageo teams.  
The main types of work they perform include:
• Construction projects, resulting from investments we’re making in the business.
• Supply manufacturing, such as packaging operators, warehouse operators and forklift truck drivers.
• Project managers across our corporate functions.
The monthly average contractor headcount in our extended workforce was 3,989, supporting our 
operations across 32 countries. This was an average of 1,108 fewer monthly contractors than in fiscal 23. 
The decrease was primarily driven by continuous management of the cost of extended workers as a part 
of ongoing productivity, a reduction in overall manufacturing volumes globally and outsourcing of 
commercial operations in India to a service provider.
Please refer to our non-financial Reporting boundaries and methodologies in this ESG Reporting Index on 
pages 94-116 for more information on how data has been compiled.

and the community elements of our commitment to champion inclusion and diversity and pioneer 
grain-to-glass sustainability.
The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the 
Remuneration Committee. More information on the membership and work of these committees is 
included in the Governance section of the Annual Report on pages 87-151.

Collective knowledge 
of the highest 
governance body
The Board’s collective knowledge and experience of ESG is enhanced with background reports on 
various economic and ESG topics that it receives throughout the year. Some of these reports are 
discussed in detail in Board meetings. 
Additionally, our ESG Executive Working Group leads discussion of ESG topics and our ‘Spirit of Progress’ 
plan, including at our Annual Strategy Conference held during the year, again improving the Board’s 
knowledge and expertise in this area. 
Further details can be found in the Governance section of the Annual Report on pages 87-151. 
2-18
Evaluation of the 
performance of the 
highest governance 
body
We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the Board, its committees and Directors every year. 
At least once every three years, the evaluation is carried out externally by an independent professional 
consultancy. 
During fiscal 24, the Board undertook an externally facilitated evaluation of its performance and 
effectiveness. This included interviewing each Director, receiving feedback from senior management and 
external advisers in relation to how the Board supervises the company’s activities, including those in 
respect of ESG.
A summary of the key recommendations and actions for focus for fiscal 24 and fiscal 25 are set out in the 
Governance section of the Annual Report on pages 87-151, which includes a continued focus on 
ESG matters.
2-19
Remuneration policies
The Directors’ remuneration report in the Annual Report on pages 122-147 includes our remuneration 
policy. As explained in that report, remuneration is driven by both financial and individual business 
performance objectives that, in some cases, include ESG as well as financial goals. 
From 2020, Executive Directors, other members of the Executive Committee and senior leaders 
throughout the business have been directly incentivised through long-term incentive plans to achieve ESG 
goals. Please see the Governance section of our Annual Report for more information. We may also 
include ESG-type measures in the individual business objective element of Executive Committee 
members’ shorter-term annual incentive plans.
Omissions: the remuneration policy applicable to all Executive Committee members.
Reason: not applicable.
Explanation: the remuneration policy covering other members of our Executive Committee is not a

Process to determine 
remuneration
Our Remuneration Committee determines senior- and executive-level remuneration in accordance with 
the remuneration policy, after taking into account engaging with views of shareholders and reviewing 
insights from the Chairman’s discussions with employees. Key aspects of pay for the Directors are 
included in the Directors’ remuneration report in the Annual Report on pages 122-147. Details of 
independent third-party advisers, including remuneration consultants, are described on page 127 of the 
Annual Report. 
Each year, at the company’s Annual General Meeting, shareholders are asked to vote to approve the 
Directors’ remuneration report. The last Directors’ remuneration report was approved by 95.51% of votes. 
The Directors’ remuneration policy, which is approved by shareholders at least every three years, was 
approved by 95.41% of votes in 2023. The governance process can be found on pages 127 in the Annual 
Report including the statement on voting by our shareholders.

median total compensation for UK employees – on page 142-144 of the Annual Report.
Percentage increase in pay
We report the year-on-year change in Directors’ salaries, bonuses and benefits relative to the average 
increase for all employees globally on pages 144. We also report the total amount paid in salaries and 
benefits to employees on page 174 of the Annual Report.

Policy commitments
Our policy commitments and approach
Our Code of Business Conduct sets out what we stand for as a business and how we demonstrate the 
highest standards of integrity and ethical behaviour. It is guided by our purpose and values. It provides 
clarity on how we and any contracted business partners representing our business, are expected to 
behave to build the trust and respect of everyone who interacts with us. 
Our Code is underpinned by a number of global policies, standards and guidelines covering specific 
areas of our work. We review these every year to make sure we take account of any changes in our 
external environment and update them accordingly through Executive Committee approval. They reflect 
our values and our commitment to doing business the right way – and can be found on our website. Our 
Code and the majority of our global policies are translated into 19 languages, and are regularly 
communicated across the business through our Business Integrity programme.
The Global Business Integrity team oversees the Global Policy Framework, which lays out the process of 
developing and revising policies, reviewing and approving them and making them available to everyone 
at Diageo. This might be through global mandatory training, for example. 
We take a precautionary approach to our Global Environment Policy, which sets out our obligations and 
expectations for managing impact on and from, the environment. We describe this in how we are 
working to reduce emissions in the Pioneer grain-to-glass sustainability section of the Annual Report on 
pages 61-73.
Policy commitment to respect human rights
Our Global Human Rights Policy covers a list of internationally recognised human rights and a list of 
specific at-risk groups that we give particular attention to. 
The authoritative intergovernmental instruments that we are committed to are referenced within our policies 
and standards. Our Global Human Rights Policy is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights to 
Work, the Children’s Rights and Business Principles, the UN Global LGBTI Standards of Conduct for Business, 
the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles and the UN Global Compact. 
Due diligence
We review and refresh our Code at least every three years and our policies and standards annually. 
Where deemed necessary, we may update any of these documents throughout the fiscal year. Each 
Global Policy has assigned to a Global Subject Matter Expert (SME) who is responsible for refreshing the 
applicable policy or standard each year, prior to distribution. We further strengthen our approach 
through analysing our breach reporting mechanism, SpeakUp, which is available to both our employees 
and business partners. Our Risk Management standard ensures we have an effective and fit for purpose 
risk management framework in place. More details can be found in our Annual Report on pages 77-85.

Embedding policy 
commitments
Neither compliance nor conducting our business with integrity are negotiable – and our approach to risk 
and compliance helps us to encourage the right behaviours and attitudes in our people and our 
contracted business partners, to ensure responsible business conduct in everything we do. 
In our Code of Business Conduct we set out which policies and standards are relevant for all our 
employees and allocate responsibility to specific groups for others: for example, employees who work 
with suppliers are responsible for implementing the commitments of our Partnering with Suppliers 
Standard; ensuring those representing our business understand and are aligned to our ways of working. 
We further support our employees to embed our global policies in their work through an annual, risk-
based training plan. This includes general awareness for all employees, as well as detailed training for 
functions managing specific business risks. 
Our Global Business Integrity team manages the integration of our commitments into organisational 
strategies, operational policies and procedures through our Global Policy Framework. This framework 
also sets out how we implement our commitments with and through our business relationships: for 
example, we expect our suppliers to adhere to and commit to our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, 
which sets out our minimum expectations on environmental, social and governance criteria. 
We undertake annual mandatory global training on our Code and key global policies. This includes an 
integrated Annual Certification of Compliance for all managers and their direct reports, and covers over 
24,000 eligible employees of which approximately 23,600 have completed the training. Our Code is 
available in 19 languages ensuring that employees around the world can access the policy.

Processes to remediate 
negative impacts
Our ambition to do business the right way means we strive to remediate any negative impacts we have 
caused or contributed to. We do this through our grievance mechanisms, which provide a framework for 
dealing with any adverse impacts that arise. 
Our environmental and social grievance mechanisms
Our grievance mechanisms cover a wide range of social and environmental issues such as: impacts on 
society; human rights; health, safety and wellbeing; harassment and discrimination; and environmental 
damage and other environmental issues.
Our key grievance mechanism is our third-party SpeakUp helpline and website, available in multiple 
languages. These can be accessed by employees and anyone in our value chain, including contractors, 
suppliers, customers and consumers. 
For employees, SpeakUp complements, rather than replaces, reporting issues directly to colleagues – line 
managers, the Legal team, the Human Resources (HR) team or Business Integrity managers. Grievances 
are investigated independently and where necessary, anonymised to protect those raising the issue.
For suppliers, we advertise SpeakUp through our Partnering with Suppliers Standard. They are also 
encouraged to raise concerns to their most senior Diageo contact, a Diageo lawyer or the market 
managing director or function head. We also expect our suppliers to apply these principles and 
processes to their own operations and workers as well as along their supply chains.
Environmental grievances are addressed locally and also reviewed quarterly by the relevant functional 
Risk Management Committees for trends or hotspot areas of focus. Findings are escalated to the Global 
Governance team to develop mitigations as appropriate.
During the reporting year, 10 grievances about environmental impacts were filed. All were addressed, 
with three being resolved through formal grievance mechanisms. One of these grievances was reported 
via SpeakUp this year, and was found to be substantiated. This was addressed through coaching and 
training, without the need for resolution through formal grievance mechanisms. We do not disclose further 
detail on how each individual grievance is resolved because this may compromise the anonymity of 
those involved. 
How we assess the effectiveness of our grievance mechanisms
On social grievances, our Global Breach Management Committee meets quarterly to identify key trends 
and themes and determine whether any interventions or actions are required. We also engage with local 
judicial or non-judicial grievance mechanisms to address matters when needed. An independent 
assessment of our Breach Management Standard took place in 2022 to assess its compatibility with the 
EU Whistleblowing Directive. All relevant adjustments were made to the standard in 2023 and nothing 
further was required in fiscal 24.
This year 35 social grievance-related allegations around health, safety and wellbeing were reported via 
SpeakUp, of which five were found to be substantiated.
These were all internal matters and did not involve any external parties. All matters were reviewed via a 
final report sent to decision makers. Appropriate remedial activities were undertaken in response 
including, where necessary, disciplinary action as well as coaching, training and controls and policy 
reviews. Completion of remediation was tracked via case leaders to ensure completion and all cases are 
now closed.
Regarding incidences of discrimination please refer to section 406-01.

As well as routine tracking and review, we also review assessments through our Third-Party Risk 
Management programme which assesses supplier risk prior to onboarding. Within our human rights risk 
domain, we require suppliers to detail how grievances are reported to their management. We are also 
able to review grievance mechanism effectiveness within our supply chain through non-compliances from 
the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) supplier assessment systems. Our reviews have led us to 
work more closely with Sedex on SMETA activities and with suppliers to assess and strengthen 
compliance with labour standards. 
We are also members of Aim-Progress, the stakeholder initiative on responsible sourcing for Fast-Moving 
Consumer Goods companies and we use several tools provided through the Grievance Mechanism 
working group to support our review of grievance mechanism effectiveness. These include the Grievance 
Mechanism Maturity Framework and self-assessment tool. 
On environmental grievances, our Environment teams in each market review grievances to consider 
whether mitigation has been effective and whether grievances have been addressed. The effectiveness of 
this approach is monitored by: 
• Drawing on internal and/or independent external expertise and feedback.
• Conducting meaningful consultation with potentially affected groups and other relevant stakeholders.
• Reviewing internal and external audit schedules.
• The effectiveness of this approach is managed by reviewing global trends in grievances and 
grievance mechanisms.

Mechanisms for 
seeking advice and 
raising concerns
Our confidential SpeakUp service is available for people to raise concerns about compliance with the 
law, our Code of Business Conduct, any of our global policies or standards or any other compliance or 
ethics matter.
Our SpeakUp whistleblowing phone line and web reporting tool can be accessed by all our employees and 
by those in our value chain, including contractors, suppliers, customers and consumers. Overall statistics and 
notable matters are reported quarterly to our Executive Committee and our Audit Committee.
We do not tolerate reprisals against anyone who reports a concern or helps with an investigation in good 
faith. Anyone found to be involved in retaliation against an individual who has raised a concern will be 
subject to disciplinary action.
More information is included in the Our principal risks and risk management section and the Governance 
section of the Annual Report on pages 77-85 and 87-151.

Compliance with laws

Environmental compliance 
Our approach to water, energy, biodiversity, emissions, and effluents and waste is described in the 
Environment section of this ESG Reporting Index on pages 32-55 below. These form part of our overall 
approach to managing our environmental impact and complying with all local laws and regulations, or 
with our own standards – whichever are higher – at each site. These are set out in our Global Environment 
Policy and our supporting framework of policies. 
The President, Global Supply and Procurement & Chief Sustainability Officer is the owner of the Global 
Environment Policy, and regularly reviews environmental and compliance performance throughout the 
year. Additionally, our Global Governance function manages quarterly Supply Chain and Procurement 
Environmental Compliance reports, which include performance reviews and address risks. 
There were 55 incidents of non-compliance related to environmental regulations, licenses, and permit 
requirements this year. There were no incidents of non-compliance with environmental consents reported 
from last year.
Socioeconomic compliance
There were no charges to exceptional items in respect of non-compliance with social and economic laws 
and regulations this year. For more information on how we manage socioeconomic compliance, please 
see GRI 2-23 and 2-24.
Omissions: the total number and the monetary value of fines for instances of non-compliance with laws

We have helped establish many social aspects organisations (SAOs) – that is, industry-funded bodies that 
work with governments, the private sector and NGOs to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. Information on 
how we work with the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking and a list of our SAOs and trade 
associations that run responsible drinking initiatives can be found in the Alcohol Policy section of our website. 
We are proud signatories of a number of initiatives, including UNGC/Science Based Targets initiative, 
UNGC’s Uniting Business and Governments to Recover Better, the Race To Zero, Race to Resilience, the 
UNGC Government Letter on SDGs in Recovery and RE100. A list of the climate goals and pledges 
Diageo supports can be found in Carbon Net Zero Strategy on page 16.

We engage internal and external stakeholders, including employees, investors, commercial partners, 
governments, NGOs, local communities and consumers. More information on our stakeholders can be 
found in the Annual Report on pages 100-107.
We actively engage stakeholders at local and global levels. At a local level, employees across our 
business engage their colleagues, local governments, customers, media and community groups on issues 
of immediate concern to them. At a global level, we engage investors, customers, suppliers and 
multinational organisations such as UN agencies and NGOs. Examples of how we engage with 
stakeholders can be found in the Stakeholder engagement section of our website.

Process to determine 
material topics
In 2019, we carried out a rigorous materiality assessment. As a starting point to this process, we identified 
actual and potential negative and positive impacts that our business activities and relationships have on 
the economy, environment and people. The assessment examined the external trends shaping our 
operating environment. It also assessed how we can most effectively align our work and the way we do 
business with the UN SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).
The assessment showed us the significance of our impacts in terms of severity, scale, scope and 
likelihood,and it informed how we prioritise the most significant impacts – which we have illustrated in our 
materiality matrix on page 3 of this ESG Reporting Index. The findings have guided how we have 
developed our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan, our reporting priorities and our assurance process. 
We review materiality on an annual basis, considering stakeholder comments – including those arising 
from our internal subject-matter experts – Corporate Relations activity, financial analysis and external 
developments such as the UN SDGs, the Paris Climate Agreement, other external initiatives and events. 
Looking forward 
By 2026, we will be expected to report under the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD). We are undertaking the double materiality assessment, the results of which will be 
reported on in advance of required reporting in fiscal 26.
3-2
List of material topics
Our materiality assessment under GRI informed our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan and helped us to define our 
reporting scope. Our analysis confirmed the importance of several key themes: promoting positive 
drinking by encouraging moderation and tackling the harmful use of alcohol; championing water 
stewardship and decarbonisation as part of pioneering sustainability from grain-to-glass; and 
championing inclusion and diversity, within our business, with our suppliers and partners and in the 
communities where we live, work, source and sell. Those risks considered most material from a financial 
and non-financial perspective are included in our Annual Report on pages 77-85. We continue to 
highlight climate-related risks within the Our principal risks and risk management section of our Annual 
Report: see page 77 for more information. 
The following GRI aspects are material to our supply sites: procurement practices, materials, energy, 
water and effluents, biodiversity, emissions, waste, supplier environmental assessment, environmental 
grievance mechanisms, occupational health and safety, supplier social and environmental assessment, 
diversity and equal opportunity and human rights assessment. The remaining additional aspects are 
material – except for indigenous rights, which did not come up as material through our stakeholder study. 
There have not been any significant changes to our list of material topics and topic boundaries since the 
previous reporting period. We took a value-chain approach to our materiality matrix, so the issues that 
we identified as material are also material to our suppliers and other business partners.

Our relationships with suppliers, investors, lenders, governments, employees and local community 
stakeholders have direct economic and social impacts, which we measure, evaluate and manage.
Our Annual Report explains how we manage financial performance and includes financial performance 
measures. Each market and function is responsible for monitoring and reporting economic performance 
against annual plans and targets. That allows us to report on overall performance against our strategy.
The Board, the Executive Committee and management teams at market and function level review 
economic performance at each of their meetings, tracking performance measures and annual operating 
plans. Details of financial performance measures are included in the Annual Report.
Where necessary, we develop or adapt our activities to improve performance against our targets or in

Our management 
approach to indirect 
economic impacts
As a global business operating in numerous locations, we have many indirect economic impacts on the 
communities we operate in.
Our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan has been developed to address our most material issues, including how we 
support sustainable social and economic growth in those communities. Our business and hospitality skills 
training programmes, for example, aim to increase employability, improve livelihoods and support a 
thriving hospitality sector that works for all.
We review indirect economic impacts as part of strategy development and risk management and we 
report them to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. For more information about our 
strategy and indirect economic impacts, see the Our growth ambition and Our performance sections of 
our Annual Report on pages 14-27.

There are a diverse array of indirect economic impacts associated with our business relationships and 
our community investment programmes. We developed our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan knowing that the 
way we do business influences the distribution of economic impacts on specific groups. 
In fiscal 24, we invested $28.9 million or 0.5% of operating profit in programmes to support the 
communities where we live, work, source and sell. This community investment data includes specific 
voluntary engagement with charitable organisations or activities that extend beyond our core business 
activities. It does not include any investment towards our programmes that drives direct commercial

Our management 
approach to 
procurement 
practices
As a multinational company, Diageo is connected to a large and varied group of suppliers. We can therefore 
seek to influence supplier behaviour and create positive social and environmental change through our 
procurement practices – who we choose to partner with and how we partner with them. Due to the 
complexity of our supply chain, there are also risks related to our suppliers’ social and environmental impacts 
which we need to manage.
We select our suppliers based on their ability to deliver services and materials effectively and in a timely 
fashion, as set out in our Partnering with Suppliers Standard. We expect them to adopt clear commitments 
and minimum standards on ethical business, human rights and health and safety, as set out in our Code of 
Business Conduct. We also expect suppliers to share the priorities within our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan.
We evaluate suppliers against various risk processes, such as business continuity and financial risk. These 
include the risk of bribery and corruption, which we manage through our One Trust assessment, which 
considers operating, market and sector risks, and which incorporates feedback from our internal reviews 
and assessments.
Procurement teams review each supplier’s ongoing performance against contract and service levels. 
We assess our suppliers’ adherence to specific requirements on issues such as labour and human rights.
Our Internal Audit and Global Business Integrity teams audit our procurement practices. From these audits, 
we produce a report for functional management and relevant Executive Committee members, which includes 
remedial actions and recommendations.
We work extensively with our suppliers to help them manage social and environmental risks and promote 
positive impact. We have used the CDP Supply Chain and Water Security programmes, through which we 
engage key suppliers on measuring and managing their carbon emissions and water-related impacts.
Diageo has a role to play in supporting minority-owned and disadvantaged businesses. Our supplier diversity 
programme is intended to create opportunities for growth and innovation alongside the advancement of 
sustainable economic impact in the diverse communities where we source, make and sell. We continue our 
collaboration with advocacy organisations like WEConnect International, MSDUK, Disability:IN, and others, to 
integrate diverse-owned and disadvantaged businesses into our network. With an ambition to increase spend 
with diverse-owned and disadvantaged businesses each year to 2030, in fiscal 24, we spent $883 million with 
diverse-owned and disadvantaged suppliers, an increase of 18% compared to fiscal 23. For more information 
see Reporting boundaries and methodologies on pages 94-116.
During the year we launched an accelerator development programme focused on sustainability. The 
programme, delivered with our partners, provides environmental skills and practices to support diverse 
businesses’ resiliency in global value chains. 55% of the first cohort of graduates from the programme were 
from women-owned businesses.
We also recognise that broader positive impact can be achieved by collaborating with our suppliers and 
partners. That’s why we have now expanded our supplier diversity focus to our Tier 2 suppliers globally. This 
expansion empowers our suppliers to accelerate inclusion and diversity in their own value chains. 
Alongside being recognised for our commitments to supplier diversity, we also celebrate the successes of our 
diverse suppliers, who contribute value to our bottom line, our consumers and our communities. In the year, 
we saw a business owned by women in Africa helping our brewers replace heavy oil fuels with biomass 
fuelled by non-conventional materials, enabling a reduction in our carbon footprint. We also saw a minority-
owned business in Europe create a unique retail space which drove consumer enthusiasm for our brands 
beyond that which is normally experienced.

Proportion of 
spending on local 
suppliers
We estimate that on average more than 92% of our raw materials volume is dedicated to ‘in-country’ 
suppliers for our sites of significant operation in the following locations: India, Ireland, Mexico, Türkiye, the 
United Kingdom and the United States. For our sites in Africa, on average more than 90% of agriculture raw 
material volume in our operations came from suppliers based in Africa during fiscal 24.
We consider operations significant where they contribute towards 90% of Diageo's total expenditure on 
procured raw materials. A 'local' supplier is defined as one that operates within the same country as our 
operations, except in Africa, where 'local' refers to suppliers located within the same region.

Our management 
approach to anti-
corruption
Diageo does not tolerate any form of corruption and has implemented extensive policies and procedures 
to counter corruption risks. In addition to the principles of our Code of Business Conduct, we have an 
internal Countering Corruption Global Policy. Its core principles are applied to all our operations and 
personnel. Routine training is undertaken throughout the business, as is specialised training for specific 
employee groups in higher-risk locations and functions. We drive adherence to the policy through our 
global and local management and within routine business operations – and we review this adherence 
during assessments carried out by internal assessors.
Our Global Business Integrity team monitors compliance with our Code, including our internal anti-
corruption principles. Our Global Audit and Risk team regularly audits our markets, which includes 
auditing their compliance procedures. The team specifies any required improvements, along with a 
mandatory completion date.
The Global Business Integrity team checks that all necessary personnel have completed their Code 
training and reports results to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board.
More details can be found in the Doing business the right way section of our Annual Report on pages 
53-54.

Communication and 
training about anti-
corruption policies and 
procedures
Governance body
The members of Diageo’s Board of Directors and the Executive Committee are provided with a copy of 
our Code of Business Conduct on appointment, which contains a section on anti-bribery. All members of 
the Board are aware of Diageo’s anti-bribery policies and procedures through their roles in risk 
management and as part of the Audit Committee. Additionally, the Executive Committee is required to 
complete an annual Code eLearning, prior to completing an Annual Certification of Compliance (ACC), 
attesting to their compliance with the anti-corruption provisions of Diageo’s Code.
Employees
Within 30 days of joining, all new Diageo group employees are required to complete training on 
Diageo’s Code. The training covers Diageo’s anti-corruption policies and procedures. All employees at 
manager level and above, and employees in certain non-manager roles, are required to complete an 
ACC. By completing the ACC, employees are confirming that they have read and understood the Code 
and our policy on anti-corruption. 
All employees are required to undergo re-training of the Code on an annual basis. 
Our compliance programme uses a risk-based approach to identify where we should focus our anti-
corruption communication and training. This approach considers the external context, geographic and 
functional risks and the output of our own reviews, including input from SpeakUp data. An example of 
our anti-corruption procedures is our third-party supplier due diligence programme, Know Your Business 
Partner (KYBP), which was refreshed at the end of 2021, in line with our external risk landscape. 
The table below shows the percentage of employees who have completed their annual training on the

The Global Business Integrity team also conducts training on Diageo’s specific anti-corruption compliance 
policy, which is cascaded throughout the markets and across the business units.  
Suppliers 
When we enter into a contract with suppliers, they receive our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, which 
contains a section relating to adherence to laws and regulations, including bribery and corruption laws. 
The standard states that our suppliers must have a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption in 
any form and that we expect our suppliers to adhere to all applicable laws.

Our management 
approach to anti-
competitive behaviour
We have an internal Competition and Anti-trust Global Policy, which is included in our Code of Business 
Conduct and in our Code training programme. We monitor adherence by reviewing emerging issues 
and outcomes from SpeakUp and by routinely assessing business functions through our internal reviews.
Our Global Business Integrity team monitors compliance with our Code, which includes our internal 
competition and anti-trust principles.
Our Procurement teams are routinely trained in anti-trust compliance and a set of guidelines has been 
created to provide specific anti-trust guidance on sustainability conversations involving competitors. 
For more information on how we evaluate our approach to compliance issues, including anti-competitive 
behaviour, see GRI 3-3 Anti-corruption in this ESG Reporting Index.

Tax
Disclosure
Our response
3-3
Our management 
approach to tax
We pay tax in accordance with all relevant laws and regulations in the countries where we do business.
Our approach to tax seeks to enable and support our ambition and business strategy, as well as balance 
the various interests of our stakeholders, including investors, governments, our people, customers, 
consumers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate.
Our approach to tax, including our commitments, core principles and governance mechanisms, is 
described in detail in our global Tax Policy.
The Board of Directors approves our Tax Policy and tax strategy, and monitors compliance each year 
through the Audit Committee – and, as appropriate, on an ad hoc basis. It delegates the authority to 
execute against this policy framework to the Finance Committee.
The Finance Committee, made up of senior management with relevant expertise (including the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer), is the supervisory body for all group tax activities. This 
Committee reviews relevant developments on issues covered by our policy three times a year, and as 
appropriate, on an ad hoc basis.
For more information about our tax governance and how we evaluate our approach, see page 5 of our 
Tax Policy.

Our response
3-3
Our management 
approach to materials
The materials we use are largely categorised as agricultural raw materials and packaging. The 
production, use and disposal of these materials contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, water 
consumption and other environmental impacts, including waste creation. Most of these impacts occur 
within our supply chain.
For further information, see: 
• Our website: For information on our management approach to materials, see the Become sustainable 
by design and Responsible sourcing pages of our website. 
• Our reports: For information on our targets relating to packaging and raw materials, see the Pioneer 
grain-to-glass sustainability section of our Annual Report on pages 71-72. For more information about 
how we measure and report on our targets, see the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section 
of this ESG Reporting Index, on pages 94-116. 
• Our policies and standards: For information on our strategies on packaging and agricultural raw 
materials, see our Reinventing Packaging Policy and Sustainable Agriculture Guidelines.
Our Supply and Procurement teams assess the impacts of sourcing materials, review supplier 
management processes and collect data on all materials purchased. This data is used to evaluate our 
progress against set targets.
Packaging 
As part of our ‘Spirit of Progress’ ambitions to reduce our environmental impact, we prioritise reducing 
packaging weight, increasing recycled content and removing secondary and single use packaging. We 
also continue to expand circular solutions where possible.
Access to quality post-consumer cullet and recycled PET continues to present a significant challenge in 
achieving our targets. We are working across sectors as well as with local authorities and trade bodies, to 
improve and strengthen end of life recycling infrastructure in key markets, to increase the return of 
packaging to our suppliers and to improve recycling rates and circularity.
Agricultural raw materials 
Our vision, outlined in our Sustainable Agriculture Guidelines, aims to make our agricultural supply chains 
economically, socially and environmentally sustainable and resilient. We are collaborating with our suppliers 
and partners to improve farm management practices across our supply chain and promote regenerative 
agriculture practices. Last year, in partnership with Metabolic, we conducted a nature impact assessment across 
our priority raw materials to deepen our understanding across each sourcing context. We used the results of this 
assessment to inform our roadmap and coalition-building efforts in a localised way. For example, in Mexico, 
where we currently source agave, we launched a new regenerative agriculture programme, actively engaging 
with agave suppliers.
We work with industry groups on regenerative agriculture frameworks and to develop protocols on the 
measurement, reporting and verification of the impact of our programmes. As members of the One 
Planet for Business Biodiversity coalition, we engage in regional landscape strategies and outcome-based 
approaches. Our efforts include improving traceability of raw materials, tracking materials covered by 
sustainability standards and certifications, committing to sourcing local raw materials and supporting 
smallholder farmers with skills, training and sustainable farming techniques.
Our performance in meeting our ‘Spirit of Progress’ targets is reported internally every quarter and 
reviewed at market, regional and global level by stakeholders throughout the business, including our 
Executive Committee and the 2030 Grain-to-Glass Strategic Business Review team.

Recycled input 
materials used
In fiscal 24, 42% of the materials used in our packaging were recycled input materials. Refer to the 
Annual Report for further discussion.
In fiscal 20, we also set an ambition to reach 40% recycled content in our plastic bottles by 2025. Our 
recycled content in plastic bottles has increased from 7% (fiscal 23) to 22% (fiscal 24) against our 2025 
ambition. We initially set our ambition at 40%; and based on latest procurement projections, we have 
adjusted our ambition for fiscal 25 target to 35%. Whilst we have made significant progress in North 
America and Europe, the anticipated changes planned for India were delayed by a change in legislation 
that impacted access to quality, food grade, recycled plastic. This created a risk to the delivery of the 
fiscal target. We are working collaboratively, both internally and externally, to move to recycled plastic 
inclusion across our largest portfolios but, in some markets, this has been slower than anticipated. 
While we have reduced our near-term target, we are also committing to increase the recycled plastic in 
our plastic packaging each year to 2030.

Our management 
approach to energy
Climate change is presenting increasingly severe physical impacts worldwide. Driven predominantly by 
the combustion of fossil fuels to generate energy, efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions through 
regulatory and policy changes raise the price of non-renewable energy in order to drive lower 
consumption and a move to a low-carbon world. Our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan includes several ambitions 
that aim to cut our carbon emissions, including our ambition for 100% renewable energy use across our 
direct operations by 2030. 
For further information, see: 
• Our website: For information on our approach to energy, as part of our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan, please 
see the Accelerate to a low-carbon world page of our website. 
• Our reports: See the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG 
Reporting Index for more information about how we measure and report on our energy-related targets.
• Our policies and standards: See our Net Zero Carbon Strategy and our Global Environment Policy for 
information on our strategy for energy and emissions. 
Our approach to energy is based on four main activities:
1. Reducing energy consumption and increasing our energy efficiency
2. Recovering and reusing energy
3. Converting energy sources to renewables – both electricity and fuel/heat
4. Minimising energy use across our supply chain.
We are investing in renewable energy solutions across our direct operations (e.g. on-site solar PV, 
biomass combustion plants), while also identifying ways to optimise our energy use (e.g. heat recovery 
and reuse in our breweries and distilleries). Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and making our 
operations more efficient are the most impactful levers to decarbonise our sites and operate in a more 
resource-efficient way. We are working towards our 2030 ambition of 100% renewable energy use 
across our direct operations, through our continued efforts to generate and source renewable electricity, 
alongside our direct and indirect fuel switching activities to enable renewable fuel and heat.
In addition to our ‘Spirit of Progress’ renewable ambition, we have set an additional ambition specific to 
electricity usage with RE100. Our near-term ambition is to source 50% of our electricity from renewable 
sources by 2025 and 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

Energy consumption 
within the 
organisation
We report three years of renewable and non-renewable direct energy consumption, with our baseline year 
being 2020. This includes both energy generated and used on site and energy supplied to our facilities.
Renewable and non-renewable direct energy consumption (TJ)1,2,3
1. Direct energy consumption refers to energy sources that we 
own or control and generate Scope 1 emissions.
2. Direct renewable energy sources are comprised of biomass, 
biogas, biofuel and renewable gas through grid. Direct non-
renewable energy sources are comprised of natural gas, LPG, 
gas oil and other liquid fuels.
3. 2020 baseline data, and data for the periods ended 30 June 
2022 and 30 June 2023, have been restated.
Δ  Fiscal 24 total direct energy consumption, renewable and non-
renewable 10,289 TJ, is within PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s 
(PwC’s) independent limited assurance scope – see pages 
118-121 of this ESG Reporting Index. For Reporting boundaries 
and methodologies, see pages 94-116.
Indirect (grid electricity) 2,155 TJ accounted for 17.3% of total energy consumption 12,453 TJ in fiscal 24.
Our total renewable energy use as a percentage of total energy consumption was 50.3% in fiscal 24, a 
5.7% increase on fiscal 23. The improvement in renewable energy performance has been driven by 
increased biomass, biofuel and biogas use primarily across Africa, tequila and scotch markets.
Renewable electricity use as a percentage of total electricity consumed was 93.7% in fiscal 24, a 7.0% 
increase on fiscal 23 largely driven by additional renewable electricity use in North America. We are on 
track to meet our 2025 RE100 interim target commitment.
Omissions: breakdown of energy consumption (or energy sold) by heating, cooling and steam. 
Reason: information unavailable/incomplete.
Explanation: the breakdown of energy consumption or energy sold by heating, cooling and steam is not 
included here as this level of detail is unavailable given the inherent complexity of heat recovery systems. 
Sold electricity is not subtracted from energy or emissions for consistency, as directed by the GHG Protocol.
302-02
Energy consumption 
outside of the 
organisation
Purchased goods and services, capital goods, transport and distribution of our brands by third-party 
logistics providers and the use of chilling and refrigeration equipment by our retail customers to store and 
display products are among the most significant areas of energy consumption outside our direct use. This 
year, total energy consumption outside the organisation is determined to be 30,471,037 gigajoules (GJ). 
Packaging materials account for 14.9 million GJ, raw materials for 6.9 million GJ, transport and distribution 
for 9,174 GJ, and chilling and refrigeration equipment for 216,656 GJ.

Reduction of energy 
consumption
This year, energy consumption from fuel, electricity, heating, cooling and steam decreased by 1.3% 
compared to fiscal 23. Direct energy efficiency gains in East Africa and India coupled with lower distilled 
volumes in tequila and packaged and brewed volumes in Nigeria are the main drivers for lower energy 
consumption. We have ongoing energy efficiency initiatives designed to decouple and minimise the impact 
of production volume increases from energy consumption.
Reporting boundaries and methodologies for energy consumption can be found on pages 94-116 of this 
ESG Reporting Index.
302-05
Reductions in energy 
requirements of 
products and services
Energy requirements of products and services are not deemed relevant, given that carbon emissions from 
this energy use do not meet the relevancy criteria stipulated by the WRI Scope 3 Reporting Standard. 
Specifically, these emissions do not contribute significantly to our overall Scope 3 footprint, nor do they 
contribute to our business-wide risk exposure.

Our management 
approach to water and 
effluents
Water is an essential ingredient in all our brands and a precious shared resource that is under increasing 
pressure in many parts of the world. A lack of access to clean water can affect the health of communities, 
their livelihoods and their ability to grow crops.
Many of our operations are water intensive and many of our suppliers – particularly of agricultural 
commodities – depend upon sufficient water.
For further information, see: 
• Our website: For information on our management approach to water, see the Preserve water for life 
pages of our website.
• Our reports: For information about the actual and potential impacts of our business operations on 
water and effluents on the economy, environment and society and information on our progress against 
our water-related targets see the Pioneer grain-to-glass sustainability section of our Annual Report on 
pages 67-68. For information on how we measure and report on our water-related targets, see 
Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index. 
• Our policies and standards: For information about our strategy and management approach to water 
and effluents, see our Preserve water for life strategy and our Global Environment Policy. 
As part of our ‘Spirit of Progress’ plan, our Preserve water for life strategy defines our strategic approach 
to water stewardship. This strategy is made up of four key pillars:
1. Water in our operations 
2. Water in our supply chains
3. Water in our communities
4. Water advocacy
As part of our Global Environment Policy, we strive to:
• Comply with regulations on water use and discharge, or follow Diageo standards where no 
regulations exist.
• Use water quality indicators to monitor our performance.
• Implement locally appropriate solutions for wastewater management, including water recycling 
when feasible.
An important part of our approach is to provide access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in 
water-stressed communities near our sites and in water-stressed areas that supply our raw materials. From 
fiscal 24, we have maintained our commitment investing in 23 WASH projects in nine countries and 
bringing safe water and sanitation to 128,000 people. We continued to make our WASH programmes 
more sustainable in the face of climate impacts and more inclusive of women and other 
underrepresented groups. For more information about this, see the section on Champion inclusion and 
diversity in the Annual Report on pages 59-60.
To better measure the effectiveness of our WASH programmes, this year we partnered with 
WASH4WORK, a multi-stakeholder initiative hosted by the United Nations Global Compact’s CEO Water 
Mandate, to create a standardised accounting framework for WASH. The framework, piloted in three 
countries, proposes to strengthen the business case for WASH investments by measuring both the 
environmental and social benefits of WASH. This new framework helps us better understand and 
communicate the value of our investments in WASH initiatives.

Interactions with water 
as a shared resource
We are a beverage company; water is an essential ingredient for all of our brands and is used 
throughout our value chain. Water is needed to grow our raw materials and manufacture our products.  
We carry out a detailed, data-driven assessment of our impacts and dependencies on water throughout 
our supply chain. We assess the water used in our products together with water used to grow our raw 
materials and conduct source-vulnerability assessments in selected watersheds.
We undertake regular water assessments for brands and with suppliers. We conduct our own site water 
risk assessments every two years; we have a range of approaches to support these assessments, 
including lifecycle analysis, environmental footprinting, the WRI Aqueduct tool and our own internal risk 
assessment process.
For more information about how we address water-related impacts, our water-related targets to be met 
by 2030 and how we work with our stakeholders – including suppliers, consumers, local communities, 
governments and regulatory groups – see GRI 3-3 on this page.
303-02 
Management of water 
discharge-related 
impacts
We aim to return all wastewater from our operations safely to the environment. Our internal standards set 
rigorous criteria for wastewater discharge to ensure we meet or exceed local and national regulations. 
We strive to maximise circularity wherever possible. The criteria for wastewater discharge include 
temperature, pH, total suspended solids, nitrates, phosphates and chemical oxygen demand and/or 
biological oxygen demand (BOD) – key parameters in determining the pollution potential and oxidisable 
organic matter present in the discharged water. We apply our global wastewater standard across all 
sites, including locations where local discharge parameters do not exist or are in development.
Omission: the profile of the receiving waterbody.
Reason: we are not disclosing every local/internal assessment we take on operational sites, since it can 
vary based on different parameters.
Explanation: mandatory regulatory requirements are fulfilled in every operational site regarding the 
profile of the receiving waterbody.

There were 193 spills or incidents during the reporting year, totalling approximately 11,362.55 m³ of spilled 
material. We have established a stringent baseline for significant spills, reflecting our commitment to 
minimising environmental impact and ensuring sustainable management practices.  
According to our definitions, a significant spill or release occurs when a substance that can be solid, 
gaseous or liquid leaks from its container or containment. 
A significant spill or release is one that meets any of the following three criteria: 
• Volume: 25 litres for hazardous substances; 50 litres for non-hazardous substances; 100 litres for 
alcohol/ethanol; 25 kg for dry spillages.
• Pollution: Has a pollution effect (i.e. might possibly affect the quality of the soil, water, air, biodiversity 
and human health).
• Reportable: Is a spill that must be reported to the appropriate government agency.
In each of these cases, actions were taken to contain and resolve the spill, and the regulator was 
informed, when applicable, and satisfied with our response, corrective action and follow-up.
Omissions: volume of unplanned discharges is not monitored.
Reason: data is unavailable/incomplete. 
Explanation: monitoring programme to be established to determine number of occasions and volumes.

Our management 
approach to 
biodiversity
Many of our distilleries, breweries and other sites are surrounded by valuable ecosystems that support 
a wide range of plant and animal species which can be vital to the livelihoods of local people. The 
production of the raw materials that we source from suppliers can also affect nature, for example, by 
impacting natural habitats, reducing the availability and/or quality of water or through the use of 
pesticides and fertilisers. 
For further information, see: 
• Our website: For information about how we manage biodiversity around our distilleries, breweries and 
other sites, see the Biodiversity section of our website.
• Our reports: For information about how we report on biodiversity, including definitions, scope and data 
preparation, see the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG 
Reporting Index.
• Our policies and standards: Our Deforestation Guidelines set out our commitments to achieving no 
deforestation and no conversion in our supply chains by the end of 2025. Our Sustainable Agriculture 
Guidelines set out our expectations for farmers, including those for the use of pesticides and fertilisers.
We continue to focus on the impact our business has on biodiversity, particularly in relation to water, our 
main ingredient. For more information on how we manage water and effluents, please see pages 38-41 
of this ESG Reporting Index. We also carry out biodiversity impact assessments for new builds and sites in 
sensitive locations. 
We have identified 54 operational sites, and other areas of land we own, that are in or adjacent to 
protected areas or areas of high biodiversity value as defined by the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment 
Tool, United Nations or National Conservation Lists. These sites are listed under GRI 304-01 below and 
have a relatively small total area of 54.2 km2. We have created a framework to develop biodiversity 
management plans for our operational sites.
Several of our sites are also close to the habitats of threatened species, as designated by the International 
Union for Conservation of Nature. In all cases, we are managing these sites in line with our licence 
conditions and are aiming to meet the expectations of local stakeholders. 
We carried out an assessment of deforestation risk within our supply chains. It found that while most of 
our raw materials are not directly associated with high deforestation risk, some may pose a potential risk. 
We have set a commitment of net zero conversion for all natural habitats, no deforestation and no 
conversion in our supply chain – by the end of 2025 for direct suppliers and by 2030 for indirect suppliers. 
We are developing regenerative agricultural pilot programmes to help farmers deliver positive outcomes 
for nature. 
To increase the efficacy of our approach to biodiversity, we will strengthen our ability to quantify our 
biodiversity impacts and dependencies across our raw material and packaging supply chains. We are 
aligning our work with external frameworks including the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures. The outcomes of this work will be reviewed by a cross-functional working group and at our 
quarterly 2030 Grain-to-Glass Strategic Business Review meetings. These developments will help us 
manage biodiversity risks and opportunities and ensure we have the right level of resources to meet 
our commitments.

Significant impacts of 
activities, products and 
services on biodiversity
None of the operations or land that we own have a significant impact on protected areas, or on areas of 
high biodiversity value outside protected areas. Through the sourcing of our agricultural and packaging 
commodities, we will impact on biodiversity; particularly through the use of land for farming and resulting 
land use change, the use of agrochemicals in these production systems and the impact on fresh water 
availability and quality.
Omissions: quantitative upstream impacts on biodiversity. 
Reason: information unavailable/incomplete. 
Explanation: we are currently completing our assessment of our upstream impacts on biodiversity.

Habitats protected or 
restored
We have implemented various initiatives to protect and restore habitats. Our water replenishment efforts 
focus on environmental restoration and conservation. In Jalisco, Mexico, we partnered with local 
authorities in San Diego de Alejandría to establish a tree nursery. This initiative promotes reforestation 
activities and the preservation of local species to maintain landscapes.
Through our regenerative agriculture programmes, we aim to protect and restore soils. In Ireland, we 
have collaborated with 44 farmers to plant cover crops and actively monitor biodiversity both above and 
below the ground.
Our brands are also leading initiatives for nature restoration; for example, Bulleit Frontier Whiskey and 
American Forests have extended their partnership, committing to planting and restoring 2.5 million white 
oak trees by 2026. These trees are essential for the production of whiskey barrels and contribute to 
combating climate change by absorbing carbon, purifying air and conserving water.
Seedlip contributes 1% of its annual global revenues to environmental causes. In Europe, we support the 
Urban Nature Project led by the Natural History Museum. This project focuses on creating urban green 
spaces and wildlife habitats.
Furthermore, we have reported a total area of 5.7 km2 of habitats protected and restored across our 
supply locations.

Explanation: we believe that our impact on any one species on the IUCN Red List is immaterial. We are 
continuing to research the impact we have on the biodiversity near our sites, and until such time that 
material impacts are identified to species, we will refrain from reporting.

Our management 
approach to emissions
The physical impacts of climate change are becoming progressively more severe globally. We are 
committed to adapting to climate change and mitigating our impact on the environment. We are 
following a science-based approach to reducing our emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3, in line with the 
Paris Agreement, to mitigate and adapt to the worst effects of climate change. 
For further information, see: 
• Our website: For information on our approach to emissions in the context of our ‘Spirit of Progress’ 10-
year strategy, please see the Pioneer grain-to-glass sustainability section of our website which includes 
our Net Zero Carbon Strategy. 
• Our reports: See the Pioneer grain-to-glass sustainability section of our Annual Report on pages 69-71 
for information on our approach to emissions and performance against our emissions targets. Also see 
the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index for 
more information about how we measure and report on our targets.
• Our policies and standards: See our Net Zero Carbon Strategy and our Global Environment Policy for 
information on our approach to energy and emissions. 
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our own operations 
By actively increasing the use of renewable energy in our operations, we are working towards reducing 
our energy-related emissions that contribute greater than 98% of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission 
footprint. In order to meet our ambition to be net zero in our direct operations by 2030, we have to 
directly abate our operational emissions by at least 95% compared with our 2020 baseline.
We are committed to driving down residual emissions from non-zero emission bioenergy sources, fugitive 
gas emissions and other sources. We measure and reduce these emissions under the We Mean Business 
initiative to address short-lived climate pollutants. Our residual emissions are minimal, making up less 
than 5% of our direct operations’ GHG emissions. A maximum of 5% of our 2020 Scope 1 and 2 baseline 
emissions could be neutralised using carbon credits to reach our net zero target commitments in line with 
a science-based approach.
We report any biological or biogenic carbon dioxide emissions separately – these emissions, from the 
combustion of bioenergy and processes like fermentation to produce alcohol, are considered ‘outside of scope’.
GHG emissions from our supply chains 
In addition to our direct operations emissions ambition, we have set a Science Based Targets initiative 
approved target to reduce our Scope 3 value chain emissions by 50% by 2030 from our 2020 baseline. 
To do so, we are building long-lasting partnerships with our suppliers and are helping our third-party 
operations to join us on this journey. Transforming the way we do business to embed a lower-carbon, 
more collaborative and circular way of sourcing our materials and services will enable us to deliver 
significant emission reductions. 
We have developed and are implementing and refining decarbonisation roadmaps to reduce our Scope 
3 emissions and we are partnering with our suppliers to improve the granularity of our Scope 3 
greenhouse gas emissions data, while driving reductions together.
Key contributors to our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions include the raw materials we source, the 
packaging we purchase and the energy purchased by our suppliers. We are dedicating resources to deploy 
and scale regenerative agriculture solutions and reduce our raw material emissions. In addition, we are 
developing circular packaging propositions that reduce the volume and type of packaging materials we use. 
We are also working with our suppliers to help them access low-cost, reliable renewable energy.

Our management 
approach to waste
As with many products, the production of alcoholic drinks has the potential to generate waste at 
multiple stages of the product lifecycle. If left unmanaged, waste from our operations and supply chain 
would create negative environmental and social impacts, including contributing to greenhouse gas 
emissions, air pollution, biodiversity loss and harm to human health. In view of these risks, managing 
waste is a priority.
For further information, see:
• Our website: For information on our approach to waste and our zero waste to landfill commitment see 
the Pioneer grain-to-glass sustainability section on our website.
• Our reports: For information on our approach to waste and performance against our waste-related 
targets, see the Pioneering grain-to-glass and responding to climate-related risk section of our Annual 
Report on pages 61-67. For information on how we measure and report on our targets, also see the 
Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index.
• Our policies and standards: Our Global Environment Policy and our Partnering with Suppliers Standard 
set out our commitments around waste and our expectations of our suppliers. 
Our primary focus for waste is end-user waste, where we have set ambitions to increase the recycled 
content included in our packaging as well as reduce the weight of our packaging. For more information, 
refer to the Annual Report on pages 71-72 and GRI 301-02. We also consider the recyclability of our 
packaging to be an important part of our strategy to increase the circularity of our supply chain and 
support our emissions reduction efforts. More information is included in GRI 301-03.
For waste generated in our direct operations, we are proud to have maintained our ambition to produce 
zero waste created intended for landfill in fiscal 24. We continue to report on waste in our direct 
operations in GRI 306-03. To continue to minimise landfill waste, we partner with certified waste handlers 
and follow a waste management hierarchy: eliminate, reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, and dispose.
We purchase most of our packaging materials, so we look to engage with our suppliers to set zero waste 
targets, as outlined in our Partnering with Suppliers Standard. For contracted suppliers, our standard 
templates include guidance language to encourage waste reduction efforts.

Waste generation and 
significant
waste-related impacts
Co-products and by-products from brewing and distilling represent the key waste streams from our 
operations in addition to creating a resource for further use. Applying circularity measures is central to our 
approach to handling our materials and reducing any waste-related impacts. We mitigate risk by 
recovering and reusing co-products and by-products from brewing, distilling and malting in agricultural 
applications, for example, as animal feed or in valorisation processes.
The most significant waste-related impacts are associated with our downstream supply chain – that is, the 
disposal of our products and packaging after use.
See GRI 306-02 below for information on our strategy to minimise upstream waste, including how we 
partner with our suppliers to carry out regenerative agriculture techniques. Downstream, we try to 
minimise waste through circular-economy initiatives, such as our EcoSpirits solution in Asia, the UK 
and Ireland.
306-02
Management of 
significant waste-
related impacts
We continue to focus on how we can use our resources to drive positive change in the way that society 
produces and manages waste. We aim to do this by creating and advocating for more efficient 
production and recycling infrastructure while developing sustainable and circular packaging solutions.
See our website and page 71-72 of our Annual Report for information about the strategy, targets and 
performance that contribute towards us becoming sustainable by design.
Over recent years, we have undertaken various initiatives to develop recycling infrastructure in 
communities where we make and sell products. 
• We work with third parties to manage the waste that is created when producing and manufacturing 
our products.
• We perform waste traceability assessments on third parties to make sure they manage waste in line 
with our contractual agreements and government legislation. 
Our 2030 ambition is to achieve zero waste created intended for landfill in our direct operations, which 
we met in fiscal 23. Our performance in fiscal 24 shows that we continue to meet our 2030 ambition. We 
are assessing our waste handlers regularly to improve our contracts with waste handlers and embed 
further internal controls to maintain our zero waste to landfill status.

Our management 
approach to supplier 
environmental 
assessment
Many of the environmental impacts of the products we sell take place within our supply chain. 
Assessing the performance of our suppliers is an important step in supporting them to manage and 
reduce these impacts.
By means of:
• Climate change questionnaire.
• Water security questionnaire.
• Supplier assessment (quality, cost, reliability, sustainability).
• Carbon and water performance reviews. 
For more information about our approach to environmental management with suppliers, see our 
Partnering with Suppliers Standard. 
308-01
New suppliers that 
were screened using 
environmental criteria
When onboarding new Tier 1 suppliers we provide them with a copy of our contracting terms, which 
includes our expectations regarding our ‘Spirit of Progress’ ambitions. We ask suppliers to take part in 
CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) if they are over a certain spend threshold and 
within a certain category which is deemed high priority for carbon and water. 100% of our suppliers have 
been screened against this criteria in fiscal 24. We are then able to collect the data and understand 
where further engagement is needed to drive improvements. 
308-02
Negative 
environmental impacts 
in the supply chain and 
actions taken
For our management approach on supplier environmental assessment please see GRI 3-3 above.
To enhance our engagement with participating suppliers, in support of our ‘Spirit of Progress’ Scope 3 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions target, we have developed ‘sprint processes’, which start with 
supplier questionnaires that include a suite of performance measures relating to climate change and 
water security. 
Through our climate change questionnaire, our suppliers are assessed on their transparency, their ability 
to report Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions data, the reduction initiatives they have in place, how 
they are setting targets against those initiatives, their ability to transition to renewable energy and how 
they are managing their Scope 3 supply chain greenhouse gas emissions. 
Through our water security questionnaire, we assess our suppliers on their transparency, how they 
report on their operational water risks, their water accounting information, the governance structures 
they have in place, their water use targets and how they engage with their supply chains. For both 
programmes, we then meet regularly with our suppliers to assess progress and where they need support 
to address challenges. 
Our Procurement function assesses suppliers on a range of factors including quality, cost, reliability and 
sustainability, and communicates their overall effectiveness and suitability through our sourcing process, 
performance management scorecard and contract documents. We have carried out detailed carbon 
and water performance reviews with our largest suppliers and developed specific action plans to address 
areas for improvement. 
For more information on our approach to environmental management with suppliers, see our Partnering 
with Suppliers Standard.

Our management 
approach to 
employment
We are committed to providing a safe, healthy and flexible working environment for all our people. We 
also strive to create a working environment that is inspiring and where talent is nurtured, developed and 
rewarded. We promote an inclusive culture where our employees feel secure, respected and valued for 
their contribution. 
For further information, see:  
• Our website and reports: For more information on our approach to employment, see the Our people 
and culture section of our Annual Report on page 55-56 and the Our inclusive culture page on our 
website. 
• Our policies and standards: We comply with all local labour laws and regulations and expect our 
suppliers to do the same. In addition, our Global Human Rights Policy includes our own policies for 
employees and our Partnering with Suppliers Standard sets the minimum standards for our suppliers. 
We measure employee engagement as one of our key performance indicators, as set out in our Annual 
Report on page 26, using our annual Your Voice survey. Based on the outcomes of this survey, in addition 
to ongoing engagement programmes, teams develop their own action plans to improve employee 
engagement and satisfaction. In fiscal 24, we are also measuring our cultural transformation through the 
Your Voice survey and teams will develop targeted plans to further embed speed and agility to 
complement global culture initiatives being rolled out. Our HR team routinely reviews our policies and 
standards to ensure they are sufficiently rigorous and will continue to strengthen our reputation as an 
employer. This helps us retain our employees while also attracting new people to the business. Our 
Executive Committee is provided with half-yearly updates on talent planning. More details can be found 
in the Annual Report on pages 122-125.

Benefits provided to 
full-time employees 
that are not provided 
to temporary or part-
time employees
Benefits provided to employees vary across the countries where we do business. In the United Kingdom, 
for example – which accounts for 17% of our global employee base – we make no differentiation in 
relation to access to benefits between full-time and part-time employees: all employees have access to 
the same benefits applicable to their grade and location, regardless of the number of hours worked. In 
the United States and Canada – which account for 10% of our global employee base – non-unionised 
employees who work fewer than 20 hours per week are not eligible to receive all the benefits offered to 
those who work for more than 20 hours which is in line with the market practice; those employees who 
work 20 hours or more in a week have access to the same benefits applicable to their grade and 
location, regardless of the number of hours worked.
Omissions: list of benefits, details across all locations.
Reason: information unavailable/incomplete.
Explanation: Diageo seeks to attract and retain the best talent and because the provision of benefits is 
aligned to local market requirements, including taking into account the provision made from a regulatory 
perspective (for example in retirement or medical care) there is variation in packages from market to 
market. We have employees in more than 60 countries and do not collate this information.

We comply with all local legislation in our provision of family leave and provide benefits beyond 
minimum requirements in many countries. We continue to apply an ambitious global Family Leave Policy, 
which is applicable to all parents regardless of gender, sexual orientation or whether they become 
parents biologically,or via surrogacy or adoption. The policy offers women in all markets a minimum of 
26 weeks of fully paid maternity leave, and men in all markets a minimum of four weeks of fully paid 
paternity leave. In 59 countries, we offer 26 weeks of fully paid paternity leave.
Data on family leave is only available for markets where we have implemented our global HR system, 
Workday.

Labour/management relations

Our management 
approach to labour/
management relations
We have a strong commitment to discuss any concerns from any of our people, including those who are 
represented through a trade union or works council. Our HR team builds relationships with these groups 
where they exist and is encouraged to involve employee representatives early in business decisions to 
give them an opportunity to contribute to key issues.
In countries where the right to freedom of association is restricted by law, we support the development of 
alternative means of representing employees’ interests, by investing in individual consultations.
We encourage our people to raise and discuss their concerns through an informal approach. In most 
cases the most effective and efficient way of dealing with a problem or potential problem is to raise the 
matter through the informal route. Our confidential SpeakUp service is equally accessible to our 
employees and anyone in our value chain, including contractors, suppliers, customers and consumers. 
We use any feedback we receive through SpeakUp and other engagement mechanisms to evaluate our 
approach to labour/management relations.
In fiscal 24, as part of our commitment to assess human rights compliance, our direct operations 
implemented a self-assessment questionnaire to review human rights risks, specifically including our 
approach to labour/management relations. Where any concerns are identified, this enables us to 
introduce corrective action plans as may be appropriate.
We believe our commitment helps to build positive relationships with our employees, increases employee 
engagement and business performance and contributes to our success against Diageo’s Performance 
Ambition. Challenging labour relations might contribute to workplace disagreements, lower employee 
engagement, reduced productivity and increased employee turnover.
For further information see: 
• Our policies and standards: For more information on our approach to labour/management relations, 
see our Code of Business Conduct, our Global Human Rights Policy.
Dedicated training modules that cover our Code and Dignity at Work help uphold our commitment to 
treating employees with respect and integrity. We expect our suppliers to adhere to these principles, as is 
outlined in our Partnering with Suppliers Standard.
We measure employee engagement as one of our overarching performance measures, as set out in our 
Annual Report on page 26, using our annual Your Voice survey. Based on the outcomes of this survey 
and our ongoing engagement programmes, each team develops its own action plan to improve 
employee engagement and satisfaction.
Our HR team routinely reviews our policies and standards to ensure they are sufficiently rigorous and will 
continue to strengthen our reputation as an employer. This helps us retain our employees while also 
attracting new people to the business.
402-01
Minimum notice 
periods regarding 
operational changes
We adhere to the law in countries that define a minimum consultation period and requirements for 
collective and individual consultation. We also aim to redeploy impacted employees or find suitable 
alternative employment for them wherever possible. If we cannot do that, we pay severance or 
redundancy. We also offer outplacement support, which varies by market, to help those who leave 
Diageo to find another job.

Our management 
approach to 
occupational health 
and safety
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for employees, contractors and 
visitors, as outlined in our Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy. We aim to prevent all workplace accidents 
and illnesses by conducting our business in compliance with applicable health and safety laws and 
regulations, company standards, policies and best practices. Our leaders are responsible for cascading 
and implementing occupational health and safety among their direct reports and third parties within their 
remit. We also expect all employees to take responsibility for their safety and those around them by 
acting in accordance with our Codes.
Our ambition is to have a world-class end-to-end health and safety culture where everyone is safer 
together when working on site, at home and on the road. We are striving to embed best-in-class 
leading key performance indicators, systems, technology and standards to enable delivery of world 
class performance.
We maintain Global Risk Management Standards (GRMS) for occupational health and safety, which 
apply to all our operations and business units. These standards aim to make sure that everyone, 
everywhere, is safer together when working on-site, at home and on the road. 
For further information, see: 
• Our website: For information about our management approach to health, safety and wellbeing for our 
employees, contractors and visitors. 
• Our reports: For more information about how we measure and report on our health and safety data, see 
the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index.
• Our policies and standards: For more information, see our Global Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy.
To track the effectiveness of our approach, our site, market and global functional teams regularly monitor 
and review occupational health and safety. We report our performance measures to Governance 
Leadership weekly, to Supply Chain and Procurement Leadership monthly and to the Executive 
Committee quarterly.
Performance trends are monitored closely and intervention activities – such as capability building and 
improvements to processes with associated investments in systems, technology, assets and resources are 
implemented as required.
More details can be found in the Annual Report on pages 57-58.

Occupational health 
and safety 
management system
We implement our occupational health and safety management system by embedding our risk 
management standards and through a robust internal assurance programme. At a minimum, all 
locations must adhere to local legislation; where the Diageo standard is higher, then the locations adhere 
to the Diageo standard.
The system covers our workers and activities across our functions, from procurement, manufacturing and 
production to marketing, sales and distribution. It includes on-site third-party contractors and third-party 
logistics providers. All Diageo locations including supply sites, offices, warehouses, visitor and technical 
centres and commercial facilities are in scope.
403-02
Hazard identification, 
risk assessment, and 
incident investigation
Through an extensive risk management programme, we assess risk, identify work-related hazards and 
implement appropriate mitigation measures and programmes. Risk assessments are carried out by cross-
functional teams comprised of individuals familiar with specific tasks and supported by a team lead who 
is trained and competent in carrying out risk assessments. We apply the hierarchy of controls when 
implementing solutions to eliminate hazards and minimise risks. There are a number of triggers for the 
review of risk assessments, e.g. a near miss or incident, a change to the process or equipment, or a 
concern raised by someone on site. Documented risk assessments for a particular area or tasks are 
shared with those working in the area and carrying out specific tasks to ensure they are aware of the risks 
and the controls in place to carry out the tasks safely. Within our manufacturing operations, through our 
tier meeting structures, we communicate that all employees have the freedom to stop a task if they have 
any concerns that they or other individuals in the vicinity of the task could be injured.
A key element to safety at all our locations is hazard reporting. It assists us in identifying and rectifying 
unsafe conditions or behaviours as well as recognise positive behaviours. Most locations have an 
electronic system to log hazard cards; these are reviewed on a daily basis and assigned for action. 
Numbers of hazard cards open and hazard cards closed are monitored through daily or weekly team 
meetings. Through our Global Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy, all employees are encouraged to 
report work-related hazards as soon as possible and remove themselves from work situations they believe 
could cause injury or ill health. For any employees who are concerned about reprisals we encourage 
them to raise any concerns through our confidential SpeakUp service.
We also have recognition schemes in place to proactively encourage every employee to look after their 
own and their colleagues’ health and safety. Our global learning platform, Diageo My Learning Hub, has 
tailored guidance about how to report and investigate work-related incidents, how to identify hazards 
and how to assess risks to determine corrective actions. 
Incidents with or without injury are investigated by local teams. Incidents meeting the lost time criteria are 
reported through to the global team within 24 hours and a full investigation to determine root cause and 
preventive actions is completed within seven days.

Occupational health 
services
Our Occupational Health and Safety strategy aims to create a culture free of work-related injury and 
illness for workers. Our continued focus on our global risk management standards ensures that health, 
safety and wellbeing controls are in place. It is mandatory for all employees to complete a medical 
questionnaire as part of the onboarding process. A health surveillance programme, provided by qualified 
healthcare professionals, is available to all employees. These services are provided on-site, and 
employees can access them through their line manager. In the case of an injury or illness (work-related or 
not), employees have access to confidential advice from independent healthcare professionals to support 
their return to work. Employees also have access to a number of other support services through our 
confidential Employee Assistance Programme (EAP).
For contractors working at our locations, they are made aware of the hazards through our risk 
assessments. Where required, Diageo recommends to their employers that they carry out a health 
surveillance programme similar to what we would have in the area.
403-04
Worker participation, 
consultation, and 
communication on 
occupational health 
and safety
Our Global Risk Management Standards mandate the use of employee consultation forums, such as 
safety committees at facility level. The standards also require employees to be involved in risk assessment 
and change-management processes where they relate to health and safety.
Individuals involved in safety incidents, and those with experience of a work area, will actively participate 
in investigations and support local management teams in the implementation of additional mitigations to 
protect the workforce. 
We also continue to use Diageo’s Flex Philosophy, developed in 2021, which provides our employees with 
a framework and principles of working patterns.
Our dedicated health and safety internal website and health and safety channel on Diageo My Learning 
Hub (our internal learning management system) aim to improve health and safety communication, 
awareness and training across our supply chain.
Contractors under our direct control attend daily team meetings where health and safety is discussed, 
they are trained in our risk assessments, they join hazard spotting walks and they are encouraged to raise 
any concerns. Where they are involved in an accident or witness an accident, they will support the 
investigation process in the same way as Diageo employees would.
For outsourced operations based at our locations, these contractors will have their own meeting structures 
and their own forums where they can raise any safety concerns to their own line managers.

Worker training on 
occupational health 
and safety
All our locations complete a training needs assessment to determine their occupational health and safety 
training requirements. There are a number of general trainings which are mandatory for all employees 
while other trainings will be task specific.
We train our employees on occupational health and safety through several channels, including:
• Diageo My Learning Hub, which is a learning management platform our employees can access every 
day for occupational health and safety capability and awareness content. Some of this training is 
mandated and assigned to workers and is based on the requirements of their role.
• Face-to-face occupational health and safety training, such as manual handling training, forklift truck 
training and explosive atmospheres training, which is delivered by approved and competent internal 
and external trainers.
• Other specific subject-matter-expert training, delivered through video conferencing.
• Where appropriate, training is evaluated throughout the training or at the end of the training using 
multiple choice type questions.
Contractors receive general training in order to access our sites and then specific training on the hazards 
and risks they will experience in the area of the site that they work. Contractors with Diageo email 
addresses can access our training portal Diageo My Learning Hub. 
403-06
Promotion of worker 
health
We promote worker health and encourage employees to access local services and systems, on a 
voluntary basis, through several channels:
• Our Benefits team facilitates non-occupational medical and healthcare services. We provide optional 
medical insurance, which is communicated to employees through internal communication channels.
• To make wellbeing part of our culture every day, everywhere, we have created the Diageo Wellbeing 
Philosophy and set up a dedicated intranet site to share information with employees. 
• On Diageo My Learning Hub, we have developed a Wellbeing channel where employees can find 
learning materials on physical, mental, social and financial wellbeing and other courses such as on 
positive drinking behaviours. We have provided all employees with access to the digital mental health 
app UNMIND and we offer an Employee Assistance Programme.
• Our psychological safety employee toolkit aims to foster an environment where everyone can openly 
speak up, take personal risks and offer opposing views without fear of consequence. 
• Our Employee Engagement team runs health and wellbeing awareness capability weeks covering 
subjects including mental health, mindfulness techniques and nutrition.
Contractors who have a Diageo email address can access the above wellbeing content on Diageo My 
Learning Hub, the wellbeing internal website and the psychological safety toolkit.

Prevention and 
mitigation of 
occupational health 
and safety impacts 
directly linked by 
business relationships
We partner with suppliers, in over 100 countries, who work with us and support our mutual commitment to 
creating the highest-quality products in a sustainable and ethical way. As outlined in our Partnering with 
Suppliers Standard, we expect our suppliers to meet applicable local and national health and safety laws 
and regulations, including those related to the design, construction and maintenance of facilities for 
employees and contract workers. We expect suppliers to comply with our Global Health, Safety and 
Wellbeing Policy and Global Standards as well as adhering to, where applicable, Diageo's Life Saving 
Rules which define the core expectations and behaviours to adopt to ensure a world-class health and 
safety culture and working environment. We expect our suppliers to train their people to required health 
and safety competence levels to enable them to conduct their work-related tasks and activities in a safe, 
healthy and responsible manner. This should also include wellbeing-specific training on areas like 
mental health.
We build core health and safety requirements and performance measure deliverables into our third-party 
service-level agreements (SLAs). This helps us prevent and mitigate significant occupational health and 
safety impacts directly linked to our operations, products or services through our business relationships. 
We regularly meet third-party service providers to review their delivery against performance measures. 
We will also withdraw from business relations with service providers that put the health and safety of 
employees at risk or that do not consistently deliver the performance measures within the SLAs.
403-08
Workers covered by an 
occupational health 
and safety 
management system
All our employees (full-time or part-time) as well as all contractors must comply with the mandatory 
requirements of our Global Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy, as well as adhere to all relevant global 
risk management standards. Adhering to these standards and requirements is continually assessed by 
internal audit. In this fiscal, on a global basis, 2,761 self-assessments were carried out on our Health and 
Safety Global Standards.
Where appropriate, our sites are accredited to the ISO 45001 (or equivalent) Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System Standard and are regularly audited against this standard by an approved 
third party.
No employees or contractors are excluded from the occupational health and safety management system.
Health and safety performance is monitored through regular site, regional and global business 
performance meetings.

Work-related injuries
In line with industry best practice, we include our own employees plus temporary staff and contractors 
who work under our direct supervision in our accident metrics.
Lost time accident (LTA)
An LTA in Diageo is defined as any work-related incident, involving injury or illness, where a person is 
unable to conduct their routine and meaningful tasks and a healthcare professional or Diageo 
healthcare professional recommends one or more days away from work (excluding the day of injury or 
onset of illness). 
Total recordable accidents (TRA)
A TRA is the sum of in-scope, work-related accidents including fatalities, lost time accidents, restricted 
work cases and medical treatment cases excluding only those that require simple first-aid treatment.
Severe injury and fatality prevention
All business units are required to conform to our Global Severe and Fatal Incident Prevention Programme. 
This programme aims to eliminate the risks that lead to severe or fatal incidents and ensures suitable and 
sustainable controls are in place. Local and regional teams make sure employees and workers are 
trained on these requirements and conduct frequent, robust self-assessment audits to measure ongoing 
compliance to this mandatory programme.
Accident rates
Our first metric, lost time Accident frequency rate (LTAFR) per 1,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs) was 1.06, 
an increase when compared with fiscal 23. This means our overall global target of less than or equal to 
1.0 was not achieved this year. The increase is driven by an increased number of lost time accidents in 
Scotch and North American markets. Our second metric, total recordable accident frequency rate 
(TRAFR) measures the number of recordable accidents per 1,000 workers. Our aim is to achieve a TRAFR 
performance of lower than 3.5. In fiscal 24, TRAFR was 1.97 accidents per 1,000 workers, reduced from 
2.06 in fiscal 23.
This year, there were no employee (including contractors under our direct supervision) fatalities on or off 
our sites and no contractor fatalities on our sites.

2. Severity rate is number of days lost per 1,000 employees and is a measure of the seriousness of the incident and consequent absence 
from work.
3. An LTA rate is not reported for independent contractors because of the difficulty and administrative burden of accurately recording 
headcount. Performance is measured by an absolute incident number.

We investigate all accidents and use data-driven trending to determine focus areas where interventions may 
be required. Cuts/lacerations across our own employee group as well as the contractor group was the 
primary incident type in last fiscal. Slips/trips and falls, while significantly reduced across our contractor 
group, continues to be an issue among our own employees and as a result we have included it as one of 
our five ‘Strive for Zero’ rules. In fiscal 24, we categorised accidents according to the seriousness of the 
injuries sustained (six categories, i.e. amputation, concussion, crushing, fracture, hospitalisation and second/
third degree burns) - 22% of all accidents have been categorised as resulting in ‘serious injuries’.

Our management 
approach to 
occupational training 
and education
We place great emphasis on continuous learning as a means of developing our people – it is a core 
pillar of our people strategy. Our vision is to support people to be better, providing the knowledge, skills, 
experiences and communities that allow them to grow themselves. This allows them to achieve a fulfilling 
and meaningful impact on Diageo's performance and their career development, all in an environment 
that is distinctive and inclusive.
Our approach is reflected in key global policies. In our Global Human Rights Policy, we recognise the 
importance of learning by committing to providing our employees with learning and development 
opportunities to enhance their skills and progress in their careers. 
In our Global Health, Safety and Wellbeing Policy, we commit to training and motivating our employees 
to work safely and responsibly. We provide comprehensive learning and development opportunities to 
equip each individual with the knowledge and skills required to advance their careers and take proactive 
steps to prevent injuries and illnesses while supporting their physical, mental and emotional wellbeing.
Through learning and training needs analyses, we identify the skills, knowledge and behavioural needs 
required of individuals and teams for Diageo to win now and in the future.
We leverage our performance management process to determine development opportunities for every 
employee across the organisation. We evaluate employees’ performance against annual goals and 
identify where they may benefit from our extensive range of internal and external training programmes. 
Additionally, each function assesses its own training needs based on its performance imperatives, 
providing additional insights to help guide employees to the right training, at the right time. 
Understanding Diageo’s capabilities gaps and needs helps us craft and execute targeted strategies, in 
partnership with our markets and functions, across Talent Strategy, Organisation Effectiveness, Talent 
Acquisition, Reward and Learning and Development. 
In fiscal 24, we have focused on company-wide capability priorities, as agreed with the Executive 
Committee, that include digital upskilling and reskilling, ESG upskilling, commercial upskilling and 
leadership and people management upskilling. See GRI 404-02 below for more detailed information.
We have a well-established process for assessing and measuring the impact of training programmes, 
with regular reviews of take-up, and impact, specifically relating to our strategic capability requirements. 
Our Learning Centre of Excellence is responsible for driving this activity and assessing progress.

Average hours of 
training per year per 
employee
We track employee training hours – from both global and local programmes. We have shifted to a more 
targeted approach to learning, helping to close skill gaps and develop new capabilities in emerging 
business priorities. This year, the system recorded a total of 635,889 learning hours, with each of our 
employees on Workday receiving an average of 24 hours of targeted learning. This represents an increase 
in learning hours per employee compared with the previous fiscal year (22 hours) – reflecting the 
acceleration of training focused on priority skills, such as coaching, digital, and on the ‘dial-up behaviours’.
Omissions: training hours per employee, by gender, training hours from non-Workday markets
Reason: information unavailable/incomplete. 
Explanation: gender is a sensitive data field that is not included in our training measurement systems. To 
protect the integrity of sensitive data, we collect it only when absolutely necessary. There is no current use 
case for training data to be analysed by gender. Data is typically analysed and provided by region, 
management level or by topic in case of Workday markets.
These figures don’t represent the full scale of development opportunities that Diageo’s continuous 
learning culture provides. They include access to a broad range of training programmes, and offer a 
diverse range of learning formats, including online courses, micro learning modules, coaching, mentoring 
and on-the-job training, catering to different learning styles and preferences. Cultivating a continuous 
learning culture fosters innovation, agility and a competitive edge in the rapidly changing marketplace 
that we operate in.

Programs for 
upgrading employee 
skills and transition 
assistance programs
We want our people to be able to access learning that is recognised and valued for the performance 
impact it drives ‘today’ and as a critical enabler of everyone's growth and development.
We achieve this through our three core strategic pillars:
1. Promote a continuous learning culture: to facilitate personalised, micro-learning moments every day, 
where individuals take ownership for their learning needs, supported by peer learning opportunities 
and enabled by our learning platform, Diageo My Learning Hub. While employees own their learning, 
line managers provide important guidance and support via regular development check-ins using our 
Partners for Growth process. 
2. Developing targeted learning programmes: that address priority skill gaps, using a blend of online 
modules, instructor-led workshops (live or virtual) and on-the-job training. Utilising Diageo My Learning 
Hub to curate and deliver personalised learning journeys based on individual roles and business needs. 
3. Ensure learning experiences are strategically targeted to equip employees as they navigate key 
transitions throughout their career journey at Diageo, for example:
• Onboarding: An immersive programme that combines micro-learning modules with opportunities to 
connect new hires with colleagues who can explain company culture, help navigate priority tasks and 
make connections with relevant networks.
• Providing learning pathways and certification programmes to help employees adapt to changing 
business needs - acquiring new skills as their roles evolve in response to emerging technologies, 
customer needs and consumer preferences. 
Our learning and development platform, Diageo My Learning Hub, contains a library of more than 
20,000 external learning resources that complement our own proprietary learning content and provides 
our people with access to best-in-class learning on any device, anywhere, at any time.

Most of our employees use Diageo My Learning Hub to supplement their personal development via 
individual development plans and performance goals, as part of their Partners for Growth (P4G) 
appraisal. Diageo My Learning Hub also supports leadership development programmes such as Impact, 
which in fiscal 24 was focused on enhancing coaching skills across our people manager population

Our performance and talent management processes encourage managers and employees to have regular 
meaningful performance and development conversations. Setting clear performance and development 
goals and discussing achievements against these goals on a regular basis is key for growth – both for our 
people and the business. We emphasise both the specific results achieved (‘the what’) and the manner in 
which they are achieved (‘the how’) in our performance and development conversations to ensure we take 
a holistic view of performance and encourage the right behaviours when delivering outcomes.

by gender unless there is strong business case for doing so.

Our management 
approach to diversity 
and equal opportunity
We are committed to creating the most inclusive and diverse culture possible, not just because it’s the 
right thing to do, but because we believe this commitment helps us to recruit and retain the best 
employees, achieve better performance and have a greater impact on society.
We are committed to supporting our people at various life stages in their careers while removing financial 
barriers, which is crucial to ensuring sustainable communities and economies. For example our Global 
Family Leave Policy, Thriving through Menopause, UK Carer’s Leave Policy and Flexible Working and 
Wellbeing philosophies support our people to make important decisions during ‘life moments’ without 
worrying about financial implications of time off. Our Global Human Rights Policy ensures that there is no 
discrimination and actively prevents any form of harassment.
We partner with our Business and Employee Resource Groups (BRGs and ERGs) who represent and share 
ideas, views and lived experiences, that help us take action in the development and implementation of 
policies and guidelines that support our people. Please see the Resource Groups at Diageo section of our 
website. Internally we communicate new policies and existing amendments to all impacted employees 
through email, online channel engagement and people manager communications, alongside awareness 
and education sessions. Externally we continue to share news of our policies and guidelines on our 
website to allow us to attract future talent, and ensure our stakeholders understand our ambitions as we 
enhance our inclusive culture.
To track the effectiveness of our approach to diversity and equal opportunity, we monitor a number of 
inclusion and diversity ambitions each month, which our Executive Committee reviews each quarter. We 
have directly linked our senior leader long-term incentive plan awards to delivering these ambitions. We 
also keep track of our employees’ experience of diversity through our annual Your Voice survey and 
regular Executive listening sessions with our BRGs and ERGs. For an overview of our leading policies and 
guidelines see the Champion inclusion and diversity section of our Annual Report on pages 59-60, and 
for information on how we calculate diversity and equal opportunity performance, see the Reporting 
boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index.
In our industry, women have been historically underrepresented in manufacturing and STEM (science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics) roles. However, we are dedicated to changing this narrative 
to create an industry that is truly diverse and inclusive through initiatives like graduates, apprenticeships, 
returnships and scholarships. 
As advertisers of beloved brands worldwide, we recognise our ability to shape culture through our 
advertising, content, partnerships and suppliers. We are committed to promoting diversity by increasing 
the representation of women and ethnically diverse directors who work on our advertising. To support 
women re-entering the industry after career breaks, we partner with Creative Equals on a returner 
scheme in the UK, North America and India. 
We are also committed to supporting people with career paths in hospitality, through Learning for Life 
and our Diageo Bar Academy, where women are proportionately represented. We believe in having a 
diverse supply chain that reflects our inclusion and diversity values. We work with diverse suppliers and 
help them become accredited with advocacy organisations, which creates opportunities for them within 
our business. More details can be found in the Annual Report on pages 59-60.

Incidents of 
discrimination and

within direct 
operations
Measures are in place to manage and monitor allegations of discrimination. The Dignity at Work Policy 
remains the cornerstone of Diageo’s commitment to identify and challenge any form of discriminatory 
behaviour wherever it may happen within the organisation, empowering and supporting colleagues to 
speak up if they witness any activity of concern.  
This year 47 allegations relating to discriminatory behaviour were reported via SpeakUp, of which four 
were found to be substantiated. These were all internal matters and did not involve any suppliers or 
external parties.  
Per Diageo’s zero-tolerance approach to discrimination, all cases were reviewed via a final report sent 
to decision makers. Appropriate remedial activities were undertaken in response including, where 
necessary, disciplinary action. Remediation plans implemented, where appropriate, for the four 
substantiated cases included coaching, training and policy review. Completion of remediation plans 
was tracked via investigation case leaders to ensure resolution. All four substantiated cases are now 
closed with appropriate action taken.
Suppliers at 
significant risk for 
incidents of 
discrimination and 
corrective actions
Our four-pillar ethical audits are used to identify incidents of discrimination and other non-compliances 
in our supply chain, as described in our Global Human Rights Policy. When such incidents are

Our management 
approach to freedom 
of association and 
collective bargaining
We have a strong commitment to industrial dialogue, supporting the right of employees to join or not join 
a trade union, as outlined in our Global Human Rights Policy. We also expect this of our suppliers, as 
outlined in our Partnering with Suppliers Standard. This is a contractual requirement.
We aim to maintain regular and open dialogue with unions over issues of common interest. We also 
believe in the same principles for our suppliers. 
We use internal reviews and our supplier assessment process to evaluate our approach. Reviews include 
input from trade unions and any feedback we receive through SpeakUp and other engagement 
mechanisms. As indicated within our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, we expect our suppliers to allow 
their employees freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations. This includes providing the right to join a trade union and prohibiting any intimidation, 
harassment or violence against any union members and representatives.
In fiscal 24, as part of our commitment to assess human rights compliance, our direct operations 
implemented a self-assessment questionnaire to review human rights risks, specifically including our 
approach to freedom of association and collective rights. Where any concerns are identified, this enables 
us to introduce corrective action plans as may be appropriate.
In countries where the right to freedom of association is restricted by law, we support the development of 
alternative means of representing employees’ interests, by investing in individual consultations. 
We believe our commitment helps to enhance constructive dialogue in the workplace, and achieves a 
peaceful, inclusive and democratic participation of employee representatives, resolves conflicts peacefully 
and effectively and enhance business performance. A failure to respect freedom of association or 
collective bargaining within our organisation and our supply chains could pose serious risks to our 
employees’ human rights, lead to industrial actions and impact the reputation and performance of 
our business.
For further information, see: 
• Our policies and standards: Details of our approach to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining are set out in our Global Human Rights Policy and in the Human Rights section of our 
Partnering with Suppliers Standard.

Operations in which 
the right to freedom of 
association and 
collective bargaining 
may be at risk 
In fiscal 24, there has been a focus on our supply sites, involving a detailed self-assessment questionnaire 
process that includes scrutiny of compliance with employee rights relating to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining. The process has not revealed any significant or material concerns.
Additionally, as part of our broader commitment to assessing human rights compliance in fiscal 24, all 
our direct operations implemented a self-assessment questionnaire to identify any potential violations or 
significant risks to human rights, including workers’ rights to exercise freedom of association or collective 
bargaining. Where any significant or material risks are identified, corrective action plans, as may be 
appropriate, will be implemented.
In countries where the right to freedom of association is restricted by law, we support the development of 
alternative means of representing employees’ interests, by investing in individual consultations.
We respect our employees’ choice to join or not join a trade union or other organisations of their choice, 
and to bargain collectively in support of their mutual interests. We support rights to exercise freedom of 
association and collective bargaining by taking appropriate measures to prohibit any form of intimidation 
or retaliation against workers seeking to exercise their right, by reviewing and refreshing our Global 
Human Rights Policy on an annual basis. 
We also investigate allegations of violations or risks to freedom of association or collective bargaining as 
and when they may arise, and take remedial action, as appropriate. In fiscal 24, we are not aware of any 
direct operations that have significant risks concerning issues related to freedom of association and 
collective bargaining.
Suppliers in which the 
right to freedom of 
association and 
collective bargaining 
may be at risk 
During fiscal 24 we conducted a saliency assessment of 15 prioritised supply chains across raw materials, 
packaging, logistics, marketing, manufacturing and indirects. Our supply chains are prioritised based 
upon inherent risk, materiality and spend data. We assessed our impact on these supply chains for salient 
risk based upon scope (number of individuals affected), scale (gravity of impact on human rights), 
remediability (our ability to address and remedy any harm caused) and the likelihood of the impact 
occurring. Within these priority supply chains, we have not identified freedom of association to be a 
salient risk. 
We identify issues of non-compliance relating to freedom of association and collective bargaining 
through our four-pillar ethical audits. We have key performance indicators in place in relation to the 
closure of any non-compliances identified; this helps ensure we remain effective with our actions taken. 
When issues are identified, we are following up with the suppliers as part of their corrective action plans 
to ensure open non-compliances are resolved.
Further information on priority supply chains can be found in GRI 3-3 Supplier Social Assessment.

Child labour

Our response

Our management 
approach to child 
labour
We act in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We do not 
permit child labour within our operations or those of our suppliers or business partners. 
We will not employ anyone under the age of 16. Employees under the age of 18 will not perform any 
hazardous work. We respect and comply with all relevant local and international laws regarding 
minimum age for employment and we verify identification documents prior to hiring.
We assess our activities for risk of the worst forms of child labour, as defined by the International Labour 
Organization’s Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182, Article 3). We investigate allegations 
as and when they come up, and take remedial action, involving relevant local agencies as appropriate. 
We assess child labour risk through our own farm visits and ongoing due diligence processes. 
In fiscal 24, as part of our commitment to assess human rights compliance, our direct operations applied 
a self-assessment questionnaire to review human rights risks, specifically including child labour risks. We 
assessed child labour risk by asking questions related to having ever found workers that were under 
minimum legal working age and the measures that are taken to verify the age of workers prior to hiring. 
Through this assessment we are not aware of any direct operations that have significant risks concerning 
issues related to child labour. Where the assessment suggests our measures can be strengthened to 
better identify and prevent risk, this enables us to introduce action plans as may be appropriate.
We have identified child labour as a potential risk within our agricultural supply chain, particularly in 
Africa. To address this, we have developed a child protection toolkit to educate our own people on the 
risks to children’s safety from working on small farms, including what activities are unacceptable and 
pose a risk to their development. We build similar awareness within farming communities through our 
training programmes. Through our human rights due diligence processes we continue to evaluate 
ongoing risk, deliver mitigation plans, train our teams and assess the effectiveness of our approach.
For further information, see: 
• Our reports: Our Doing business the right way section in the Annual Report for more information on our 
management approach to human rights.
• Our policies and standards: Details of our approach to child labour are set out in our Human Rights 
Global Policy.

labour, as defined by the International Labour Organization’s Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 
1999 (No. 182, Article 3). We will investigate allegations as and when they occur and take appropriate 
remedial action, involving relevant local agencies as appropriate. 
Suppliers at significant 
risk for incidents of 
child labour
As indicated within our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, we expect our suppliers to adhere to 
applicable laws and regulations concerning minimum working age and to protect employees under 18 
by allowing them access to education, limiting employment during typical resting hours and ensuring no 
exposure to working conditions that are likely to jeopardise their health and safety or morals.
Children and young workers is a key element of the SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) audit 
methodology and age verification takes place through the review of documents including policies and 
procedures in place to manage child labour. We have key performance indicators in place in relation to 
the closure of any non-compliances identified, which helps ensure we remain effective with our actions 
taken. When issues are identified, we follow up with the suppliers as part of their corrective action plans to 
ensure open non-compliances are resolved.
During fiscal 24 we conducted a saliency assessment of 15 prioritised supply chains across raw materials, 
packaging, logistics, marketing, manufacturing and indirects. Our supply chains are prioritised based 
upon inherent risk, materiality and spend data. We assessed our impact on these supply chains for salient 
risk based upon scope (number of individuals affected), scale (gravity of impact on human rights), 
remediability (our ability to address and remedy any harm caused) and the likelihood of the impact 
occurring. Across our 15 priority supply chains, we have identified child labour to be a potential high risk 
in some of our key raw materials (sugar and sweeteners, cereals, grapes, flavours and botanicals) as well 
as packaging components (glass, cartons and corrugate, labels and sleeves, cans, closures and crowns) 
and within manufacturing (chemicals and gases, barrels and kegs). We are working with our supply 
chain partners, industry bodies, NGOs and peers to create action plans for mitigating any risks identified. 
This also includes the development of a child protection toolkit for both farming supply networks and our 
employees involved with the supply chain.

Our management 
approach to forced or 
compulsory labour
We act in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We do not 
permit forced or compulsory labour within our operations or those of our suppliers or business partners. 
We do not permit involuntary servitude for our employees or within our suppliers or business partners. This 
includes the consideration of debt bondage and unacceptable financial costs forced upon workers. We 
respect and comply with all relevant local laws regarding voluntary employment. We are committed to 
protecting the rights of all workers in our value chain, including migrant workers who may be only 
temporarily present.
In fiscal 23, as part of our commitment to assess human rights compliance, our direct operations applied a 
self-assessment questionnaire to review human rights risks, specifically including forced or compulsory 
labour risks. We assessed forced or compulsory labour risks by asking questions such as workers having the 
right to refuse to work overtime and having the freedom to leave employment when a contract expires. 
Through this assessment we are not aware of any direct operations that have significant risks related to 
forced or compulsory labour. Where the assessment suggests our measures can be strengthened to better 
identify and prevent risk, this enables us to introduce action plans as may be appropriate.
Through our human rights impact assessments, we have reviewed higher-risk areas of our value chain 
network, including agricultural supply chains in Africa, Brazil, Guatemala, India, Mexico, Turkey and the 
United Kingdom and are not aware of any operations that have significant risks concerning issues related 
to forced or compulsory labour. If any allegations are reported, we will investigate and take remedial 
action, involving relevant local agencies as appropriate. More details are included in our submission in 
the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Statement. We will continue to assess forced or compulsory labour 
risk through our ongoing due diligence processes. We will investigate allegations as and when they occur 
and take remedial action, involving relevant local agencies as appropriate.
For further information, see: 
• Our reports: Our Doing business the right way section in the Annual Report for more information on our 
management approach to human rights.

Human Rights Global Policy.

Operations at 
significant risk for 
incidents of forced or 
compulsory labour
Through our assessments on internal operations, we have not identified any significant risks related to 
forced or compulsory labour. We will investigate allegations as and when they occur and take 
appropriate remedial action, involving relevant local agencies as appropriate. 
Suppliers at significant 
risk for incidents of 
forced or compulsory 
labour
As indicated within our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, we expect our suppliers to strictly prohibit the 
use of forced labour, including debt bondage and any financial burdens on workers by withholding 
wages or paying expenses such as recruitment fees. 
Workers must not be restricted with their movement, for example, the retention of identification documents 
and bank payment cards, and workers should not be forced to use company-provided accommodation.
Within our supply chain, incidents of non-compliance raised under Employment Is Freely Chosen are 
captured through four-pillar ethical audits. We have key performance indicators in place in relation to the 
closure of any non-compliances identified and this helps ensure we remain effective with our actions 
taken. When issues are identified, we are following up with the suppliers as part of their corrective action 
plans to ensure open non-compliances are resolved.

Security practices
Disclosure
Our response
3-3
Our management 
approach to security 
practices
Our Corporate Security Policy outlines our four pillars of security: people security, physical security 
(including of our products and assets), investigations and business continuity and crisis management. This 
policy is underpinned by a number of minimum standards and guidelines that every market and site are 
required to adhere to.
We operate security programmes in all markets and at all sites, with nominated and trained individuals 
responsible for the programme. The level of security in each market and at each site is determined by its 
size, risk levels and any local requirements.
Markets and sites are supported by a central team of security experts, who have regional and functional 
responsibility for security delivery across all our markets and the four pillars. This team runs global 
training, such as our online personal safety training, oversees global security communications and 
awareness and helps to ensure we satisfy external regulations and requirements.
We take a risk-based approach to security, with a global programme to identify and assess risks and 
produce mitigation plans. We review security risks routinely and communicate with our people around the 
world to raise awareness. The Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and the Audit and Risk 
Committee review our approach and relevant risks as part of our corporate risk management programme.
Market adherence to our corporate security policies and standards is continually monitored through 
reviews and audits. Global corporate security policies and standards are also subject to regular review. 
All updates or adjustments are communicated clearly to markets and sites.
The Corporate Security team regularly benchmarks its practices and performance with other multinationals. 
It also liaises closely with government security experts through its membership of organisations such as the 
UK government’s National Protective Security Authority, the US State Department’s Overseas Security 
Advisory Council and the International Security Management Association.
410-01
Security personnel 
trained in human rights 
policies or procedures
100% of our internal Corporate Security team have been trained on our ‘Human Rights Principles for 
Corporate Security’, which sets out the key principles and requirements to help ensure that human rights 
are upheld and respected wherever we implement security operations to protect the business. These 
principles complement the overarching Diageo Global Human Rights Policy, and are also based upon, 
and consistent with, the internationally recognised ‘Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights’.
This training does not apply to third-party organisations providing security personnel. Third-party security 
personnel are contractually required to adhere to our Code of Business Conduct, which incorporates our 
Human Rights Global Policy. That policy requires our third-party suppliers to adopt similar human rights 
standards and operate in line with our Partnering with Suppliers Standard, which also includes express 
reference to compliance with human rights conventions.

Our management 
approach to local 
communities
Our social impact strategy addresses our actual or potential positive and negative impacts on our 
employees, supply chains and communities. We manage potential negative impacts through our human 
rights framework (see page 54 of our Annual Report).
Our positive impact programmes aim to provide opportunities for those in our communities to grow as 
we grow. We focus our efforts where we can make the biggest impact – providing access to skills and 
resources in communities where we live, work, source and sell our products. This includes providing: 
• Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) to communities around our production sites or local sourcing 
areas in water stressed areas. 
• Business and hospitality skills to underrepresented groups to increase their employability and improve 
livelihoods. 
• Agricultural skills and resources to our smallholder farmers to strengthen their resilience and economic 
prosperity in our most important ingredient-sourcing landscapes.
All of our programmes strive to be inclusive by design and tackle barriers to equal representation and 
participation of women and other underrepresented groups (see page 60 of our Annual Report).
Delivery of our community programmes is managed by various functions within the business, including 
the Corporate Relations, Supply and Procurement teams. 
In fiscal 23, we reached our 2030 target for WASH, meaning all nine of the markets included in our target 
invested in WASH projects since 2020. In fiscal 24 we maintained our commitment, investing in 23 WASH 
projects in nine countries and bringing safe water and sanitation to 128,000 people. 
Learning for Life, our business and hospitality skills programme for people from underrepresented groups 
reached 36,000 people in 36 countries and territories in fiscal 24.
Across our key Africa sourcing regions and farming communities in Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda, we 
have delivered seeds and inputs to smallholder farmers and are working alongside development and 
agronomic partners to improve farmer resilience. In fiscal 24 we delivered good agricultural practice training 
to 11,000 smallholder farmers. Cumulatively we reached 24,000 in total and continued to digitise smallholder 
value chains to collect farm-level data and use insights into the development of our programmes.
See the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index for 
more information on how we measure and report on our progress. 
Local communities
413-01
Operations with local 
community 
engagement, impact 
assessments, and 
development programs
We run community impact programmes in 83% of our markets. Before we commence a programme we 
seek insights from relevant data, take guidance from our expert NGO partners and conduct stakeholder 
interviews with local communities to ensure we design a programme that meets their needs. We also 
carry out detailed research when the programmes are complete to understand their full impact: for 
example, in fiscal 24 we assessed the effectiveness of our water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) 
programmes in Africa. In fiscal 23 we conducted an impact assessment of Learning for Life, our business 
and hospitality training programme for underrepresented groups in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
Similar studies have assessed the impact of our smallholder farmer programmes in Africa. We use the 
findings and recommendations from these assessments to continuously improve our programmes.

Supplier social assessment

Human rights in our 
supply chain
Many of our real and potential social impacts are found in our supply chain. We are aware of potential 
negative social impacts that can occur within our supply chain and have designed our due-diligence 
programme to identify, mitigate and remedy these if we have caused the impact or work with partners to 
address this when we deem we have contributed to the impact. These impacts can affect labour and 
working conditions, occupational health and safety as well as other human rights impacts including 
forced labour and child labour. From within our policies, our Partnering with Suppliers Standard sets out 
the minimum social, ethical and environmental standards we require suppliers to follow as part of their 
contract with us. Those standards set out our commitment to acting in line with the United Nations 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and with international standards set out in the 
eight core International Labour Organization conventions and recommendations.
Our Responsible Sourcing programme enables us to identify, assess and manage social and ethical 
impacts in our supply chain. All Tier 1 suppliers go through an initial screening process that considers 
category risk, country risks and level of spend. Where the process flags a potential risk, the supplier must 
register with Sedex (Ethical Data Platform) and complete a Sedex self-assessment questionnaire. Third-
party audits are conducted for high-risk suppliers every three years assuming all non-compliances are 
addressed. Audits follow the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) Four Pillar Audit Protocol or 
equivalent. Where we identify instances of non-compliance, we raise a corrective action plan report and 
work with that supplier towards a resolution. While specific issues of non-compliance are acted on as part 
of the audit process, these reviews also identify trends that allow us to revise standards and guidance. If 
specific suppliers consistently fail to respond to improvement plans, as identified as part of their 
performance evaluation, we reserve the right to stop working with them.
During fiscal 24 we conducted a saliency assessment of 15 prioritised supply chains across raw materials, 
packaging, logistics, marketing, manufacturing and indirects. Our supply chains are prioritised based upon 
inherent risk, materiality and spend data. We assessed our impact on these supply chains for salient risk 
based upon scope (number of individuals affected), scale (gravity of impact on human rights), remediability 
(our ability to address and remedy any harm caused) and the likelihood of the impact occurring.
Identifying vulnerable stakeholders
We identify those potentially vulnerable to human rights abuse in several ways, including through our 
human rights impact assessments, which cover markets in each region we operate and have an impact. 
These assessments will look in detail at a market’s salient risks and vulnerable stakeholders, both within 
our own operations and our supply chain. Finally, we work through stakeholder initiative groups such as 
Aim-Progress and collaborate with other industry peers to identify common vulnerable and affected 
stakeholders so that we can address any issues and support these stakeholders collectively.
Capacity building and training programmes
We ensure capability training is in place for our supply chain, which ensures suppliers are competent in 
executing robust, Responsible Sourcing programmes. In fiscal 24, we launched an e-learning module on 
identification and remediation of salient risks. This has been launched to our 15 priority supply chains and 
will cascade the principles of responsible sourcing through the supply chain.
Through our stakeholder work with Aim-Progress, Diageo is an active member of both the Africa and 
APAC regional hubs. Through these hubs, we are working with other existing members to address the 
most salient human rights and responsible sourcing issues across different regions, with the intention to 
provide direct supplier training and capability building, as well as providing a platform to pilot new tools 
and methodologies that support the promotion of human rights and collective mitigation of human 
rights risks.

New suppliers that 
were screened using 
social criteria
All suppliers of procurement-managed spend go through the screening process described in GRI 3-3 on 
page 84 of this ESG Reporting Index. This includes areas such as labour standards, human rights including 
child labour, and legal compliance on issues such as pay. 
We have embedded our ‘Spirit of Progress’ goals and our Responsible Sourcing programme within the 
contractual clauses and tender processes for selecting new suppliers. Our suppliers are therefore 
incentivised to make progress against the environmental, social and governance focus areas laid out in 
our Partnering with Suppliers Standard. Doing so will increase their chances of winning new business or 
maintaining current business. 
414-02
Negative social 
impacts in the supply 
chain and actions 
taken
All suppliers flagged as a potential risk are required to register with Sedex and to complete the Sedex self-
assessment questionnaire. 
Suppliers who represent a potential high risk are flagged so they can be independently audited against 
the  SMETA Four Pillar Audit Protocol or equivalent. We have 421 such suppliers, of whom 323 or 77% were 
independently audited in the past three years. We commissioned all audits, but some will be accessed 
through the mutual recognition work stream of our stakeholder network Aim-Progress.
A total of 2,301 issues of non-compliance have been raised through these audits, with 51% relating to 
health, safety and hygiene issues; 11% to working hours; 10% to wages and benefits; 7% to management 
systems; and the remaining 21% to other categories. We have followed up with the relevant suppliers with 
corrective action plans and are working together to resolve them, having already closed 1,772 issues of 
non-compliance – of which 12 were business critical – in fiscal 24. Where required, we are arranging follow-
up audits to verify the issues have been closed.

Our management 
approach to public 
policy
As part of doing business, we engage with governments, public interest groups, industry associations and 
a broad range of similar bodies around the world.
In doing so, our aim is always to comply with all laws governing political activity.
Our Corporate Relations team manages our engagement with stakeholders on public policy matters, 
assessing risk and aiming to support the delivery of our strategy including, for example, promoting 
positive drinking and relevant fiscal and regulatory policies. For more details on our approach to public 
policy, see our Code of Business Conduct.
The team assesses public policy risks and opportunities and develops our Corporate Relations strategy in 
line with our Growth Ambition at market and global levels. We regularly monitor and evaluate 
international trade, indirect tax and regulatory risks around the world, analysing their impact and 
developing mitigation and response strategies. 
More information on how we manage indirect tax, trade and regulatory risks can be found in our 
Annual Report on page 109, while our position on specific issues related to alcohol policy is described on 
our website.
We track the effectiveness of our approach across our markets through internal reporting frameworks 
and ensure we adopt our strategy and allocate resources appropriately throughout the year.
The Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee review our overall 
approach, along with the management of specific public policy issues, as part of our overall corporate 
risk management activity.

Political contributions
We have not given any money for political purposes in the United Kingdom, made no donations to EU 
political organisations, nor incurred any EU political expenditure during the year. 
Our US-based subsidiary, Diageo North America, Inc, made contributions solely at its own discretion to 
non-EU political candidates and committees in the United States, where it is common practice. 
Contributions of approximately $1.1 million were made by Diageo North America, Inc, during the financial 
year to US state and local candidates and committees, consistent with applicable laws. Additionally, our 
Australian-based subsidiary made contributions, solely at its own discretion, totalling approximately 
$0.01 million. 
Contributions reflect no endorsement of a particular political party, and contributions were made with the 
aim of promoting a better understanding of our business and our views on commercial matters, as well 
as a generally improved business environment.

Our management 
approach to customer 
health and safety
We aim to design and make products that are always safe for consumers to drink, and that meet their 
expectations in terms of taste, consistency and presentation. We have a programme of certification for 
our sites that includes:
• Site internal assessment to Diageo standards.
• Market independent assurance of adherence to standards.
• ISO 9001 for our production facilities.
• FSSC 22000 at our brewing and packaging locations.
At the date of this ESG Reporting index, 75%(fiscal 23 restated: 70%) of our production facilities were ISO 
9001 certified and 87%(fiscal 23: 85%) of our brewing and packaging sites were certified to FSSC 22000. 
We have revised the previous year’s figures on ISO 9001 certification to incorporate updated information 
regarding our India sites, which are managed through an internal quality management system in 
accordance with ISO 9001 principles. In April 2024, Diageo successfully transitioned its head office from 
FSSC 22000 version 5 to FSSC 22000 version 6. The certification of our head office is a critical part of our 
global site certification regarding food safety and quality. We continue to enforce the importance of 
certifications, and as we build new sites or acquire new businesses, we actively pursue certifications of 
these sites within a reasonable timeframe. 
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews our key risks relating to customer health and safety, counterfeit 
products and contamination, with a particular focus on food fraud.
The Supply and Procurement team led by the President, Global Supply and Procurement, monitors our top 
performance measures for quality, tracking total and critical pack defects, as well as distribution defects.
Market-level teams meet monthly with the market head of governance to review these performance 
measures, along with other global and local quality performance measures, and escalate any issues to the 
market head of supply chain. This is part of our broader environment, health, safety and quality agenda.

Assessment of the 
health and safety 
impacts of product and 
service categories
Our products are mostly low risk in that they are unlikely to be a source of food poisoning and are stable 
at ambient temperatures. All products are subject to liquid testing and inspection for defects – which 
include critical defects relating to product safety and legislative requirements.
We have continued to review and update our global quality and global risk management standards. 
These are shared with all production sites as they are published.
See the Reporting boundaries and methodologies section on pages 94-116 of this ESG Reporting Index for 
more information on how we measure and monitor packaging defects and distribution defects.

Our management 
approach to marketing 
and labelling
We take seriously our duty to develop, produce, market and sell our brands responsibly, and all our 
marketing is governed by our Diageo Marketing Code, Digital Code, Responsible Research Global 
Standard and Data Protection Global Policy. Our Diageo Consumer Information Standard provides 
mandatory minimum standards for the information that must be included on labels and packaging on all 
Diageo-owned brands in all geographies (where legally permitted). Labels and packaging must include 
alcohol content and nutrition information per serve, alcohol content by volume (ABV), at least one and up 
to three responsible drinking symbols, a reference to our global responsible drinking website, 
DRINKiQ.com, a list of allergens, and recycling and sustainability symbols.
For further information, see: 
• Our policies and standards: For more details about labelling and information, see the Diageo 
Marketing Code, Quality Global Policy and the Diageo Consumer Information Standard.
We have a cross-functional review process in place for all marketing communications that ensures 
compliance with the Diageo Marketing Code. On rare occasions where communications are in breach of 
the Code, we revise them accordingly. Our Marketing, Legal, Brand Technical and Regulatory functions 
review packaging and labelling of new products to ensure they comply with the Diageo Consumer 
Information Standard.
We review the Diageo Marketing Code every two years to ensure it remains best-in-class compared with 
rigorous standards in our industry and that it is consistent with evolving technologies. Any changes are 
signed off by members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Marketing Officer, General 
Counsel and Director of Corporate Relations.
Our market-based teams, including general managers, review the efficacy of marketing communications, 
as do our global brand teams and global Marketing function. By continually assessing our 
communications, we gain feedback that helps improve future campaigns.

• Content, particularly with regard to substances that might produce an environmental or social impact: 
Legislation typically requires a statement of alcoholic content on our alcoholic products; where 
applicable, products contain this information.
• Safe use of the product or service: Together with companies that form the International Alliance for 
Responsible Drinking, we have committed to adding an age-restriction symbol or equivalent words on 
all our alcohol brand labels, including alcohol-free extensions of alcohol brands. This is alongside our 
existing commitment to include up to three responsible drinking symbols. These, together with all other 
requirements of the Diageo Consumer Information Standard (see previous page), are implemented on 
new brand innovations and when we renovate existing brands. 
• Disposal of the product and environmental/social impacts: We mandate the Mobius loop (or 
equivalent) on packaging and point of sale materials as part of our Diageo Consumer Information 
Standard; this is included on our products where relevant and permitted, with the exception of United 
Spirits Limited in India, which does not use the Mobius loop on its product labelling at present. 
Additional packaging and recycling information is provided on packaging components where 
required by legislation. 
Our products are covered by the Diageo Marketing Code.

Incidents of non- 
compliance concerning 
product and service 
information and 
labelling
We take compliance with product, service information and labelling regulations seriously. Given the 
breadth of our portfolio we may, on occasion, be subject to challenge, for example where legislative 
changes occur at short notice.  
We address these issues rapidly by means of working closely together with regulators and brand teams 
to agree the necessary course of action in each case.
While we accept some small risk in our labelling, we have an absolute zero-risk approach when it comes 
to product safety.
417-03
Incidents of non- 
compliance concerning 
marketing 
communications
This year, no complaints about Diageo’s advertising were upheld by the following key advertising 
regulators and/or industry bodies: 
• ASA and Portman Group (UK)
• ASAI (Ireland)
• ABAC (Australia)
However, a complaint was upheld against our tequila brand Casamigos by DISCUS (USA).
For more details, and for industry complaints, see our Annual Report on page 52.

Our management 
approach to customer 
privacy
We hold personal data about employees, customers, suppliers, consumers and other individuals, including 
prospective and former employees. Our Global Data Privacy Programme, led by our Senior Data Privacy 
Director, has been designed to protect all personal data that we handle in our business activities.
Our Code of Business Conduct and Data Privacy Global Policy set out our key principles and standards in 
how we handle data in line with our values, data protection laws and respect for privacy as a human right.
Our Chief Information Security Officer leads a cyber security programme to defend against cyber-attacks. 
That includes seeking to protect information assets through embedding a security aware culture, 
implementing compliance management procedures and operating an intelligence-driven cyber resilience 
programme. They are supported by the Chief Information Officer and together they co-chair the Digital 
and Technology Risk Management Committee in reviewing key security risks and mitigations. They report 
on the status and mitigations for enterprise risks to the Audit and Risk Committee and the Audit 
Committee twice a year.
Our Internal Audit team periodically audits our Global Data Privacy Programme. Findings are reviewed, 
with mitigation and improvement activities developed as appropriate, including escalation to our Audit 
and Risk Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Board if required.
Data privacy issues may also be raised through our SpeakUp helpline, to line managers, market legal 
counsels, data privacy stewards, the HR team or directly to the Senior Data Privacy Director.
For more information, see our Code.
