Chairman's Letter
I am writing to you after assuming the Presidency of 
Telefónica. I begin this challenge with humility, ambition 
and the pride of being part of something great. Since my 
appointment, I had the opportunity to meet many of the 
outstanding professionals whose talent and dedication 
have contributed to building the company we have 
today.
Since its foundation over a hundred years ago, 
Telefónica has come a long way of challenges and 
successes. A century of history that reflects the 
anticipation and transformation of a pioneering and 
strategic company.
2024 results show the strength of the company and the 
progress we have made in executing our strategy. We 
have met our targets and maintain solid operational and 
financial momentum in key markets.
We are leaders in infrastructure and digital capabilities, 
we operate the largest fiber network in Europe and we 
continue to lead 5G deployment. All of this ensures a 
better customer experience and greater customer 
loyalty. In addition, we continue with strict capital 
allocation while maintaining a proactive and prudent 
balance sheet management.
As we look into the future, in an accelerating world, our 
role will be more critical than ever. Telefónica is not just 
a telco, but a technology company that is ready and in a 
privileged position to lead this new era.
Our purpose, "To make our world more human by 
connecting lives", drives us to accelerate responsible 
digitalisation that generates a positive impact for all our 
stakeholders. We reaffirm our commitment to the 
principles of the UN Global Compact and the 
Sustainable Development Goals. At Telefónica, we are 
committed to keep innovating and create a more 
connected, inclusive and sustainable world.
These sustainability efforts have been recognized 
internationally. In 2024, Telefónica reaffirmed its 
leadership by being distinguished as one of the ten most 
sustainable companies according to TIME and Statista 
and the seventh in Newsweek's Excellence Index. 
Additionally, it is a leader in climate action according to 
CDP and tops the sector in FTSE4Good, ISS ESG 
Corporate Rating and the World's Benchmarking 
Alliance's Social Benchmark (WBA).
Finally, I would like to acknowledge our professionals for 
their commitment, ambition and dedication to achieving 
our goals, and our customers and shareholders for their 
continued trust. Thank you, on behalf of the entire 
Telefónica Board of Directors.

1.1. Context
The year 2024 continued to be marked by uncertainty 
and volatility arising from geopolitical and 
macroeconomic tensions. Exceptionally, this volatility 
coexisted with opportunities for growth and technology-
based transformation. The telco sector has benefited 
from its defensive nature, the investments made in new 
networks and a regulatory environment which 
anticipated constructive changes to rules that have 
become obsolete under the new competition conditions.
A volatile global environment with 
opportunities for growth:
Elections took place in major/influential countries in 
2024, in the midst of a socio-political environment that 
remains strongly polarised. These brought about 
changes in government and, looking to the future, 
uncertainty about the evolution of key policies for 
economic development.
• There are expectations for a resolution to active 
military and geopolitical conflicts, although there is 
also a risk of new tensions as we move towards a 
multipolar world.
• Potential risks related to world trade and global supply 
chains have emerged as a result of new and more 
protectionist tariff policies and restrictions on 
technology use.
• The positive trend in inflation in 2024 suggests bigger 
cuts in interest rates, although these expectations may 
not be materialise due to changes in fiscal policies. 
Global growth, especially in the Eurozone, remains 
low, while states' debt levels are rising after the years 
of expansionist policies.
• Against this backdrop, financial markets have 
responded positively (mainly in the US). Defensive 
stocks (such as telcos) have created value for their 
shareholders.
Accelerated technological change led by 
the development of artificial intelligence 
(AI):
The pace of technological change continues to 
accelerate. Artificial intelligence and the components 
required to develop it (e.g. semiconductors, computing, 
energy and communications) have boosted investment 
in infrastructure.
• AI applications have driven a strong growth in demand 
for capacity at data centres (DC), with some regions 
under strain from high occupancy rates. The 
construction of new DCs requires new electrical 
infrastructure to be developed in parallel.
• There is continued uncertainty around the impact of AI 
on traffic needs in telecommunications networks. 
Operators maintain their expectations of growth in 
demand for edge computing, to reduce latency and 
enable new business models.
• Tensions in the supply of semiconductors and other 
dual-use technologies are reshaping the technology 
supplier ecosystem.
• The launch of a new generation of connected devices 
with integrated AI capacities could accelerate the 
replacement of current devices, increasing sales of 
hardware.
• Advances in quantum computing are starting to make 
its implementation within a reasonable time period 
viable. For telcos, developing new security and 
encryption systems is crucial in order to protect 
communications.
• Operators continue to carry out the softwarisation of 
their networks and transform their operations. By 
opening up their infrastructure to third parties through 
standardised APIs, operators are paving the way for 
new business models (e.g. API-centric SaaS).

Demographic change in a social 
environment that is more aware of the 
impact of technology:
The population in economically significant regions of the 
world  continues to age. Meanwhile, new technologies 
are rapidly impacting the lives of the general public and 
business activities.
• The transformation of the population pyramid 
continues in the West as life expectancy rises and the 
birth rate stalls, in spite of the impact of migration 
flows. This shift compromises economies in the long 
term, straining healthcare and retirement systems.
• Consumers and  families have suffered the impact of 
inflation and interest rates in previous years, reducing 
their disposable income.
• The profound impact that new technologies and 
applications are having on societies is fuelling anxiety 
about their potentially negative repercussions 
(security, misinformation, etc.).
• For companies, the key is resilience. Technological 
transformation and digitalisation are gaining speed to 
increase productivity. In turn, against a backdrop of 
geopolitical tensions, the concern about cybersecurity 
is growing.
• Applications based on AI are beginning to be adopted 
to a significant degree by consumers, companies and 
developers. Given the expectations surrounding this 
technology and projected investment, there is 
reasonable uncertainty about its measurable 
economic impact and the time horizons for returns.
• The work environment continues to evolve. As new 
generations replace previous generations, they cause 
shifts in corporate culture. The implementation of AI 
and technological acceleration have given rise to a 
structural shortage of talent, which needs to be 
addressed.
The telecommunications industry remains 
highly dynamic, with a sector that is calling 
out for new regulatory models:
Despite a past of stagnation in terms of revenues and 
adverse regulation, telcos continue to galvanise 
investment in networks, to the benefit of the societies in 
which they operate. The sector is therefore strategic 
both in itself and as an enabler of other sectors.
• Competition within the sector remains high in the 
main markets, with a multitude of brands and 
operators. Despite inflation, communication prices are 
still falling, especially in lower-value segments.
• The operators in developed markets are completing 
the fibre and 5G investment cycle and have 
announced fewer future investment needs. There is 
some uncertainty about the next generation of 6G 
mobile technology (capacity, time horizons, costs, 
etc.).
• In Europe, the publication of the Letta and Draghi 
reports could herald a new approach for industrial 
policy. For telcos, the two reports confirm the 
diagnosis of the state of the sector.
• Operator consolidation has begun to reshape some 
European telecommunications markets. A favourable 
policy could strengthen a strategic and distinctly 
investment-oriented sector in Europe.
• The overhaul of an obsolete regulatory environment 
has already started in certain markets, with aspects 
such as infrastructure-sharing obligations, wholesale 
prices, authorisation systems and concessions being 
reviewed. In Europe, discussions about standardising 
the conditions for spectrum acquisitions have begun.
Strategy: Telefónica has built solid 
foundations for the future
In a highly dynamic macroeconomic and industry 
landscape, Telefónica has developed a solid positioning 
based on:
◦Telefonica’s relevance to its growing customer base, 
reflected on improved satisfaction and customer 
loyalty indicators.
◦A world-class positioning in infrastructure, based on 
fibre and 5G, on Telefonica’s core markets.
◦An experienced management team, with proven 
know-how in the sector.
Looking ahead, Telefónica remains focused on creating 
value for its shareholders and other stakeholders 
through rigorous strategic analysis and the effective 
execution of key initiatives:
◦Focus on its core markets: A customer-centric 
approach that enhances satisfaction and loyalty 
metrics, leveraging leading brands and tailored value 
propositions for each market segment.
◦Improved operational efficiency: A commitment to 
efficiency, leveraging technology for process 
optimisation. Past investments made in fibre and 5G 
networks enable a significant reduction in capital 
expenditure (CapEx) needs, directly impacting free 
cash flow (FCF).
◦Efficient capital allocation: Financial discipline and 
strict criteria for capital allocation, prioritising 
investments in growth areas with high potential for 
returns.

In 2024, global equity markets posted positive returns 
(MSCI World index +25.1% in euro terms) in a year 
characterized by a change of route by the major central 
banks, which implemented the first interest rate cuts 
after the disinflationary process initiated in 2023. US 
stock markets performed particularly well, boosted by 
the “Magnificent 7” technology stocks on the back of 
expectations about Artificial Intelligence. European stock 
markets posted more modest returns, in a more difficult 
economic environment in some countries, while Asian 
stock markets rallied in the last quarter (announcement 
of strong monetary and fiscal stimulus in China).
Among the main European indices (Stoxx 600, +6.0%, 
EStoxx-50 +8.3%), the DAX (+18.9%) recorded the best 
performance, reaching new record highs, followed by 
the Ibex-35 (+14.8%) which continued its upward trend, 
with +40.9% in the last two years. The CAC 40 ended in 
negative territory (-2.1%), in a year of political turmoil in 
France, which reinforced doubts about its financial 
stability. The US markets were the undisputed leaders of 
the year, with the S&P 500 (+23.3%) surpassing 6,000 
points in the last quarter after the Republican victory, 
while technology companies continued to dominate, 
driving the Nasdaq (+28.6%) sharply higher.
The bond market has had a volatile year due to 
inflationary spikes in the final months of the year. Long-
dated bond yields rose sharply from the year’s lows, with 
the 10-year US Treasury bond bouncing from a low of 
3.60% to 4.60%, while the 10-year German bond yield 
climbed from a low of 2% to over 2.40%.
The European Telco sector delivered its best relative 
performance versus the market since 2013 (+16.2% vs. 
Stoxx 600 +6.0%), ranking as the third best sector in the 
region supported by its defensive nature in an 
environment of growing macroeconomic doubts. The 
expected return to revenue growth, evidence that 
CapEx has peaked and high single-digit EPS growth 
have improved market sentiment towards the sector, 
coupled with expectations of market consolidation. The 
outlook for the Telco sector in 2025 remains positive; 
continued revenue growth (albeit more moderate) 
should benefit companies' EBITDA through operating 
leverage, which together with lower CapEx efforts, will 
continue to drive growth in cash generation. 
Furthermore, the implementation of artificial intelligence, 
together with an improved regulatory scenario and 
optimism about consolidation movements in the sector, 
support these good expectations for 2025.
Telefónica has continued to successfully execute its 
strategy, benefiting from the transformation process it 
started years ago. Today, it is a stronger, faster growing, 
more efficient and more sustainable company. And it is 
consistently delivering on the long-term objectives. It 
has also continued to work to address regulatory and 
competitive obstacles (leading the necessary 
discussions to improve the regulatory environment), the 
depreciation of Latin American currencies, especially the 
Brazilian real in the second half of 2024, and the context 
in general, in order to preserve and increase value for 
shareholders. Telefónica has also benefited from the 
entry of new shareholders in the share capital, providing 
greater stability to the shareholding structure. In addition 
to this, Telefónica is a leader in network development 
(fibre and 5G) and customer relations (NPS and churn), 
with a focus on prioritizing investments and improving 
operating leverage to generate solid double-digit FCF 
growth.
Telefónica ended 2024 with a market capitalization of 
22,323 million euros, a share price of 3.94 euros, an 
increase of 11.4% in the year, and a total shareholder 
return of 19.9%, in line with the sector.
Regarding the dividend payment, 0.3 euros per share in 
cash has been paid in 2024 (0.15 in June and 0.15 in 
December). The 2024 dividend policy is 0.3 euros per 
share in cash (0.15 euros per share paid in December 
2024 and 0.15 euros per share to be paid in June 2025). 
This dividend is in line with the minimum of 0.3 euros per 
share announced until 2026. The dividend yield for 2024 
has been set at 7.6%. Finally, 80.3 million treasury shares 
were cancelled in 2024.

1.3. Business overview
1.3.1. Highlights
In 2024, Telefónica delivered a good operational 
performance. Telefónica maintained a strong market 
position, growing in high-value accesses such as fiber 
and mobile contract. The company has grown in 
reported revenues y-o-y, but impairments losses of 
assets have had an adverse effect on profit. Investments 
in next generation networks, like Fiber and 5G, have 
allowed Telefónica to maintain and grow its customer 
base in terms of accesses, by offering customers a 
better experience. In addition, Telefónica has driven 
efficiencies to reduce certain operating expenses by 
switching from copper to fiber broadband networks and 
switching off certain legacy technologies, network 
sharing, reducing energy costs through hedging 
agreements and right-sizing the organization.
Telefónica’s total accesses were 389.9 million as of 
December 31, 2024, increasing by 0.6% year-on-year, 
mainly due to increases in mobile contract accesses in 
Telefónica Brazil and IoT accesses in VMO2 and 
Telefónica Brazil, offset in part by the decrease in 
prepaid accesses, mainly in Chile and Mexico, due to the 
high competitiveness in the prepaid market and the 
decrease in fixed telephony accesses across the Group.

Mobile accesses totaled 300.3 million as of December 
31, 2024, up 0.6% compared to December 31, 2023, 
mainly as a result of the good performance in mobile 
contract accesses in Telefónica Brazil and IoT access 
growth in VMO2 and Telefónica Brazil, offset in part by 
the decrease in prepaid accesses mainly in Chile and 
Mexico, due to the high competitiveness in the prepaid 
market. Postpaid accesses represented 52.0% of the 
Group's total mobile accesses excluding IoT (+1.6 p.p. 
year-on-year).
The Group's strategy is based on attracting valuable 
customers in the markets in which it operates.
Fixed broadband accesses stood at 27.4 million at 
December 31, 2024, up 2.3% year-on-year. Retail fiber 
(FTTH) accesses stood at 17.9 million at December 31, 
2024, growing by 11.2% compared to December 31, 2023.
Pay TV accesses totaled 10.1 million as of December 31, 
2024, down 1.4% year-on-year.

1.3.3. Analysis of results
Revenues in 2024 totaled 41,315 million euros, up 1.6% 
year-on-year compared to 2023, due mainly to the 
positive growth in service revenues (+2.5%) driven by 
higher B2B revenues (+4.8%), offset in part by the 
depreciation of various Latin American currencies (in 
particular the Brazilian real) against the euro.
Other income mainly includes work on fixed assets and 
gains on disposal of assets. In 2024, other income 
amounted to 1,692 million, up 9.8% year-on-year 
compared to 2023. The year-on-year increase was 
driven mainly by the award received by Telefónica in 
ICSID arbitration proceedings against the Republic of 
Colombia, with an impact of 380 million U.S. dollars 
(approximately 358 million euros).
• Supplies amounted to 13,377 million euros in 2024, up 
0.6% year-on-year, mainly as a result of higher costs in 
Telefónica Spain and Telefónica Brazil driven, by costs 
associated with IT-related activity (including 
digitalization projects by B2B customers) in Telefónica 
Spain and higher equipment purchases and handset 
costs in Telefónica Brazil.
• Personnel expenses amounted to 5,882 million euros 
in 2024, down by 18.4% year-on-year. Personnel 
expenses were higher in 2023 mainly as a result of the 
Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain 
companies in Telefónica Spain in 2023 (resulting in a 
provision of 1,320 million euros before taxes).
The average headcount was 101,384 employees in 
2024, up 2.6% compared to 2023.
• Other expenses amounted to 12,554 million euros in 
2024 up 21.9% year-on-year, mainly as a result of 
impairments of goodwill and other assets. In 2024, 
Telefónica recorded impairment losses on intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment in Argentina 
in an aggregate amount of 1,274 million euros and 
impairment losses on goodwill in an aggregate amount 
of 866 million euros with respect to the  cash-
generating units in Chile (397 million euros), Peru (226 
million euros), Telefónica Tech UK & Ireland (192 million 
euros) and BE-terna Group (51 million euros). 
Additionally, Telefónica recorded in Perú impairment 
losses on intangible assets (54 million euros), 
impairment losses on held-for-sale assets 
corresponding to the property, plant and equipment of 
the fiber optics business of Pangea (108 million euros) 
and goodwill (34 million euros). In 2023, there was an 
impairment of goodwill amounting to 58 million euros 
in Ecuador.
As a result of the foregoing EBITDA totaled 11,194 million 
euros in 2024 down 1.7% year-on-year.
EBITDAaL in 2024 totaled 8,448 million euros, down 
4.0% year-on-year, due to the lower EBITDA , and higher 
costs associated with operating leases in 2024.
Depreciation and amortization amounted to 8,799 
million euros in 2024, remaining stable compared to 
2023 (8,797 million euros).
Operating income totaled 2,395 million euros in 2024 
compared to 2,593 million euros in 2023. The year-on-
year decrease was due mainly to the higher other 
expenses (as a result of impairments), partially offset by 
the lower restructuring expenses incurred in 2024, as 
well as the higher service revenues (+2.5%).
The share of (loss) income of investments 
accounted for by the equity method in 2024 was a 
loss of 49 million euros, compared to a loss of 2,162 
million euros in 2023. The higher loss in 2023 was mainly 
due to the results of VMO2, which were adversely 
affected by a goodwill impairment amounting to 3,572 
million euros (1,786 million euros of which was reflected 
in the consolidated income statement of the Telefónica 
Group in 2023).

Net financial expense amounted to 1,789 million euros 
in 2024, decreasing 115 million euros compared to 2023. 
The lower amount in 2024 is mainly due to the positive 
impact of 154 million euros in interest associated with 
the favorable award relating to the ICSID arbitration 
procedure initiated by Telefónica, S.A. in 2018 against 
the Republic of Colombia.  
Corporate income tax represents an expense of 348 
million euros in 2024 compared to an income of 899 
million euros in 2023. The income in 2023 was mainly 
due to the tax effect of the provision associated with the 
Collective Redundancies Plan and the recognition of 
deferred tax assets for the future use of tax credits, both 
in Spain. 
As a result, loss for the year attributable to equity 
holders of the parent in 2024 was 49 million euros, 
mainly due to the impairments recorded, compared to a 
loss of 892 million euros in 2023.  
Profit attributable to non-controlling interests was 
258 million euros in 2024 (318 million euros in 2023). The 
variation is mainly due to decreases in the results 
attributable to minority interests in Germany, following 
the public takeover bid, and in the results attributable to 
minority interests in Brazil.
CapEx totaled 5,475 million euros in 2024, down 1.9% 
year-on-year, in line with Telefónica's objective of 
reducing CapEx.

Telefonica Spain maintained a positive evolution in 2024, 
with year-on-year growth in accesses and the main 
financial indicators.
As the main commercial novelty in the residential 
segment, it is worth highlighting the reinforcement of 
the TV entertainment offer with the integration of Apple 
TV+, through the signing of a strategic agreement that 
brings the complete Apple TV+ service to 
miMovistarFicción subscribers, as part of the navigation 
on the TV platform and also on demand. 
Additionally, Telefónica Empresas continues to advance 
in its proposals for the business segment. Positive 
developments on this front include the collaboration 
agreement with Microsoft to facilitate the adoption of 
Copilot+ PCs, Windows devices with integrated AI. This 
collaboration will allow Spanish companies to upgrade 
their workstations and improve productivity through 
advanced digital solutions. 
Telefónica Empresas has also incorporated Network 
Slicing capability into the Movistar Intranet service, 
becoming the first operator in Spain to offer quality of 
service in private mobile connectivity end-to-end for 
secure access to corporate networks in mobility. 
This advancement allows for the establishment of 
secure virtual private networks (VPNs) on mobile 
devices that are able to communicate with each other 
even in high-traffic scenarios, optimizing 
communications with new technologies that require 
greater mobility or lower latency.
Finally, Movistar Prosegur Alarmas, the joint venture 
of Prosegur and Telefónica Spain, reached 550 
thousand customers as of December 31, 2024, up by 
12.8% y-o-y.
Telefónica Spain had 41.8 million accesses as of 
December 31, 2024, an increase of 1.9% compared to 
December 31, 2023, driven by the positive evolution of 
mobile IoT, mobile contract and FTTH accesses, both 
those included in the convergent offer, as well as 
standalone mobile contract and FTTH accesses not 
included in the offer. These growth drivers were offset in 
part by decreases in mobile prepay and retail fixed 
accesses, as well as decreases in legacy wholesale 
accesses, despite year-on-year growth in FTTH 
wholesale accesses.
The convergent offer (residential and SMEs) had a 
customer base of 4.6 million customers as of December 
31, 2024, an increase of 0.5% y-o-y.
Retail fixed accesses totaled 7.8 million and decreased 
2.2% as compared to December 31, 2023, with a net loss 
of 174 thousand accesses in 2024.

Retail broadband accesses totaled 6.0 million (+1.4% 
y-o-y), with net adds of 85.8 thousand accesses as of 
December 31, 2024.
Retail fiber (FTTH) accesses reached 5.6 million in 
December 2024 (an increase of 5.1% as compared to 
December 31, 2023), representing 93.3% of total retail 
broadband customers (an increase of 3.2 p.p. y-o-y) with 
net adds of 270 thousand accesses as of December 31, 
2024. At December 31, 2024, fiber deployment reached 
30.8 million premises, 1.6 million more than at December 
31, 2023.
Total retail mobile accesses stood at 21.1 million as of 
December 31, 2024, an increase of 4.7% as compared to 
December 31, 2023 mainly as a result of an increase in 
the IoT accesses base (up 22.0% y-o-y), together with 
increases in mobile contract accesses (up 1.6% y-o-y). 
Pay TV accesses reached 3.5 million at December 31, 
2024, increasing 2.7% year-on-year, mainly driven by the 
positive evolution of Movistar Plus+, an OTT product.
Wholesale accesses stood at 3.4 million at December 
31, 2024, down 4.4% year-on-year. Wholesale fiber 
(FTTH) accesses were up 1.7% year-on-year and 
corresponded to 98.2% of total wholesale accesses at 
December 31, 2024 compared with 92.2% at December,

Analysis of results
Revenues in 2024 amounted to 12,791 million euros, 
growing 1.1% y-o-y mainly as a result of increased IT 
revenues due to the higher demand for digitalization 
projects by B2B customers, partially offset by the 
decrease in wholesale and other revenues.
The evolution of revenues excluding mobile handset 
sales is described below:
• Retail revenues totaled 10,092 million euros in 2024, 
an increase of 2.2% year-on-year, driven by greater 
B2B sales volume and IT revenue growth and 
increases in tariffs charged to customers and, to a 
lesser extent, by growth in B2C customers.
• Wholesale and other revenues totaled 2,167 million 
euros in 2024, decreasing by 4.3% year-on-year, 
mainly due to the impact of cuts to the mobile 
termination rate (MTR) (which decreased by 50% 
during 2024) and the discontinuation of “Fórmula 
1” (racing cars) TV content in 2024, partially offset by 
the positive evolution of MVNO revenues.
The evolution of expenses is explained below:
• Supplies amounted to 5,313 million euros in 2024, up 
5.7% year-on-year compared to 2023, mainly 
attributable to the increase in costs to support the 
increased IT-related activity (due to the higher 
demand for digitalization projects by B2B customers).
• Personnel expenses amounted to 1,717 million euros 
in 2024, down 46.2% year-on-year compared to 2023. 
The year-on-year evolution was mainly attributable to

the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by certain 
companies in Telefónica Spain in 2023 (which resulted 
in a provision of 1,320 million euros before taxes in 
2023).
• Other expenses amounted to 1,624 million euros in 
2024, down 6.1% year-on-year compared to 2023.The 
higher expenses in 2023 were due mainly to provisions 
recorded in Telefónica Spain to optimize the 
distribution network.
EBITDA reached 4,614 million euros in 2024, a year-on-
year increase of 42.9%.
Depreciation and amortization amounted to 2,202 
million euros in 2024, remaining stable compared to 
2023.
Operating income amounted to 2,412 million euros in 
2024, a year-on-year increase of 134.5%. The lower 
operating income in 2023 was mainly attributable to the 
impact of the Collective Redundancies Plan adopted by 
certain companies in Telefónica Spain in 2023 (resulting 
in a provision of 1,320 million euros, before taxes), as well 
as the higher provisions recorded in Telefónica Spain to 
optimize the distribution network in 2023 (60 million 
euros).

VMO2
In accordance with applicable accounting standards, 
Telefónica's share in the results of VMO2, our 50:50 joint 
venture with Liberty Global Plc in the United Kingdom, is 
presented in a single line of the income statement, 
“Share of (loss) income of investments accounted for by 
the equity method”. However, the VMO2 segment 
information included in this section is presented using 
management criteria and shows 100% of VMO2's results; 
Telefónica’s actual percentage ownership of VMO2 is 
50%.
More than three years after the formation of VMO2, the 
company continues to integrate and innovate while 
investing heavily to expand and upgrade its fiber and 5G 
networks to provide the highest quality connectivity to 
more regions of the country.
VMO2’s gigabit fixed network footprint reached 18.3 
million premises at the end of 2024, delivering 1.3 million 
homes serviceable in the year underpinned by the 
expansion of the FTTH network of nexfibre, the FTTH 
joint venture formed by Telefónica Infra, Liberty Global 
and InfraVia. The expansion of the nexfibre footprint 
helped to deliver 20,000 new accesses in 2024.
The upgrade of VMO2’s fixed network to fiber continued 
at pace across the year, with a total fiber footprint of 6.4 
million premises by year end when including the nexfibre 
footprint.
In its mobile business, significant progress was also 
made in the evolution of the company’s mobile network 
to 5G, with UK outdoor population coverage standing at 
75% at the end of 2024, an increase of 24 percentage 
points in the year.
In December 2024, the UK’s Competition and Markets 
Authority approved the merger between Vodafone UK 
and Three UK in the United Kingdom (‘MergeCo’). 
Subject to the final completion of the merger and 
relevant approvals, VMO2 expects to acquire spectrum 
from MergeCo and MergeCo’s enlarged network would 
participate in network sharing with VMO2.
The following table shows the evolution of accesses in 
VMO2 in 2024 compared to 2023:

The total accesses base grew 0.6% year-on-year and 
stood at 58.0 million as of December 31, 2024, mainly 
driven by the increase in wholesale accesses and the 
8.5% year-on-year growth in IoT accesses, offset in part 
by decreases in fixed telephony accesses, mobile prepay 
and contract accesses and Pay TV accesses.
The contract mobile customer base decreased 1.8% 
year-on-year to 15.8 million accesses, with a net loss of 
286 thousand accesses in 2024 due to the poorer 
performance in the consumer segment as a result of 
more aggressive competition, especially from MVNOs, 
reflecting broader market trends.
The prepay mobile customer base decreased 3.3% 
year-on-year to 7.4 million accesses, with a net loss of 
248 thousand accesses in 2024.
IoT mobile customer base grew 8.5% year-on-year 
and reached 12.4 million accesses underpinned by the 
continued roll-out of the United Kingdom’s Smart 
Metering Implementation Programme. The Smart 
Metering Implementation Programme (SMIP) is an 
energy-industry led program which aims to roll-out 
approximately 53 million smart electricity and gas meters 
to domestic properties and non-domestic sites in the 
United Kingdom.

Analysis of results
In 2024, revenues amounted to 12,616 million euros, 
growing 0.6%, mainly due to price increases 
implemented by VMO2 and the appreciation of the 
pound sterling offset in large part by the decline in 
handset sales and B2B revenues.
• Mobile business revenues amounted to 6,718 million 
euros in 2024, declining by 1.8% year-on-year, mainly 
as a result of the decrease in handset revenues as 
customers held onto their devices for a longer period, 
partially offset by the appreciation of the pound 
sterling.
• Fixed business revenues amounted to 4,550 million 
euros in 2024, increasing by 2.2% year-on-year, mainly 
driven by growth in revenues per customer household 
due to price increases, coupled with the appreciation 
of the pound sterling, partially offset by the decline in 
B2B fixed revenues.
• Other revenues amounted to 1,348 million euros in 
2024, growing 7.5% year-on-year, mainly driven by 
increased revenues related to the expansion of the 
nexfibre network and the appreciation of the pound 
sterling.
The evolution of expenses is explained below:
• Supplies amounted to 4,354 million euros in 2024, up 
1.4% year-on-year, mainly due to costs of expanding 
the nexfibre network and the appreciation of the 
pound sterling, offset in part by a decline in handset 
costs.
• Personnel expenses amounted to 1,295 million euros 
in 2024, down 0.6% year-on-year. The decrease was 
due in part to the realization of synergies through the 
execution of restructuring plans aiming to deliver a 
single operating model (through the convergence of 
several functions across sales, marketing, product and 
call center teams) and a leaner company, offset in part 
by the appreciation of the pound sterling.
• Other expenses amounted to 3,016 million euros in 
2024, down 0.6% year-on-year mainly due to lower 
commercial costs related to lower handsets sales 
(translating to decreases in associated bad debt, costs 
of sale of receivables and commissions to handset 
suppliers), partially offset by the appreciation of the 
pound sterling.
EBITDA reached 4,467 million euros in 2024 compared 
to 859 million euros in 2023. The lower EBITDA in 2023 
was mainly due to the impairment of goodwill in 2023 
amounting to 3,572 million euros. 
Depreciation and amortization amounted to 3,371 
million euros in 2024, decreasing by 8.5% due to a lower 
depreciable base after certain assets fully depreciated in 
2023.
Operating income amounted to 1,096 million euros in 
2024, compared to an operating loss of 2,826 million 
euros in 2023. The lower operating income in 2023 was 
mainly due to the impairment of goodwill in 2023 
amounting to 3,572 million euros.

In 2024,Telefónica Germany continued with commercial 
traction and low churn in a competitive market. 
Telefónica Germany’s key milestones in 2024 were as 
follows:
• Good financial execution, with EBITDA accelerating y-
o-y in the last three months of 2024.
• Ongoing commercial activity reflecting sustained O2 
brand appeal and enhanced partner brands 
momentum.
• Telefónica Germany made good progress with the 
densification and further roll-out of its green 5G 
network resulting in coverage 97% as of December 31, 
2024, leaving Telefónica Germany well on track to 
achieve nationwide 5G coverage by the end of  2025. 
• Telefónica Germany maintained mobile trading 
momentum in a competitive environment, leveraging 
continued enhancement of network and service 
quality.
• On January 26, 2024, Telefónica completed a 
voluntary public acquisition offer for shares of 
Telefónica Deutschland, followed by a public delisting 
acquisition offer completed on April 29, 2024. As a 
result of these transactions and direct market 
purchases by Telefónica outside the offers, Telefónica 
reached approximately 96.85% of the share capital 
and voting rights of Telefónica Deutschland. 
In August 2023, the 1&1 Group disclosed that it would 
switch its host network operator in Germany from 
Telefónica Germany to Vodafone in the second half of 
2024, under a long-term, exclusive national roaming 
partnership with Vodafone Group. This exclusivity 
arrangement includes the non-discriminatory provision 
of national roaming services in areas not yet covered by 
the new 1&1 mobile network and in particular includes 
access to the 5G network of Vodafone Group, including 
mobile communication standards 2G and 4G and future 
mobile communication standards and technologies. The 
agreement between the 1&1 Group and Vodafone has 
limited Telefónica's network sharing opportunities with 
1&1. Migration of customers to 1&1’s own network and 
Vodafone’s network (for roaming) began in the first 
quarter of 2024 and is expected to be completed in the 
second half of 2025. It is expected that the completion 
of this migration will have a significant impact on 
Telefónica Germany’s accesses and revenues.The 
ongoing migration of 1&1 customers from Telefónica’s 
network to 1&1’s own network and Vodafone’s network 
(for roaming) is referred to below as the “change to the 
1&1 business model".
The total access base decreased 0.4% year-on-year 
and stood at 49.7 million on December 31, 2024, mainly 
driven by a 4.2% decrease in the prepay mobile accesses 
base, which reached 14.9 million.

The contract mobile customer base reached 27.9 
million accesses in 2024, growing 0.7% year-on-year due 
to O2 good performance driven by brand appeal, 
continued network enhancement and service quality, 
partially offset by the lower customer base in partner 
brands as a result of  the change to the 1&1 business 
model. Migration of customers to 1&1’s own network and 
Vodafone’s network (for roaming) began in the first 
quarter of 2024 and is expected to be completed in the 
second half of 2025. Excluding 1&1 customers accessing 
Telefónica Germany’s network, the contract mobile 
customer base was 17.3 million accesses as of December 
31, 2024, growing 5.0% year-on-year mainly due to the 
O2 brand customer growth. 
The prepay mobile customer base decreased 4.2% 
year-on-year to 14.9 million accesses reflecting a net loss 
of 652.9 thousand accesses in 2024 due to the German 
market trend of prepaid-to-postpaid migration.
Broadband accesses reached 2.4 million accesses 
(down 0.4% y-o-y), with a net loss 9.0 thousand 
accesses in 2024, mainly driven by legacy DSL churn, 
offset in part by continued customer for high-speed 
cable and fiber accesses.

Analysis of results
Total revenues were 8,492 million euros in 2024, a 
year-on-year decrease of 1.4% driven by the decrease in 
the mobile business.
• Mobile business revenues totaled 7,596 million 
euros decreasing 2.2% y-o-y as a result of 50% cuts in 
the mobile termination rate (MTR) from 0.40 euros to 
0.20 euros per minute effective from January 1, 2024, 
as well as the change to the 1&1 business model, 
partially offset by the good performance of O2 own 
brand revenues. Excluding the impact of the cuts to 
the mobile termination rate, mobile business revenues 
were down 1.1% year-on-year in 2024. 
• Handset revenues (which are included in mobile 
business revenues) amounted to 1,785 million euros, 
decreasing 4.7% y-o-y due to lower commercial 
activity of the “O2 myHandy” monthly installment 
handset financing model, which faced tough 
competition after the record volume sold in the 
previous year.
• Fixed business revenues were 857 million euros, 
increasing 3.6% y-o-y due to the increasing demand of 
fiber and cable technologies combined with price 
increases
Mobile  ARPU reached 10.4 euros (-3.4% y-o-y), due to 
the decline in contract and prepay ARPU of 7.8% and 
1.9% respectively, impacted by the 50% cut to the mobile 
termination rate (MTR), as well as the higher share of 
second and third SIM cards tied to family contracts, 
which usually have lower ARPUs. Data ARPU reached 
7.0 euros (-5.5% y-o-y), also as a result of higher shares 
of second and third SIM cards tied to family contracts 
which usually have lower ARPUs.

The evolution of expenses is explained below: 
• Supplies amounted to 2,588 million euros in 2024, 
decreasing 3.3% year-on-year mainly as a result of the 
lower handset cost of sales and the positive effects 
from cuts in mobile termination rate (MTR) fees paid to 
other operators.
• Personnel expenses amounted to 700 million euros 
in 2024, increasing 4.7% year-on-year, reflecting 
further staff and wage increases in 2024, which were 
intended to support Telefónica Germany's 
transformation and growth plans.
• Other expenses amounted to 2,631 million euros in 
2024, decreasing 5.7% year-on-year compared to 
2023 from savings in commercial costs (due to the 
optimization and digitalization of customer service, 
lower marketing costs and efficiencies in commercial 
channels), savings from the digital transformation of 
system and network operations and energy cost 
optimization.
EBITDA  totaled 2,765 million euros in 2024, growing by 
4.7% year-on-year.
Depreciation and amortization amounted to 2,226 
million euros in 2024, decreasing by 4.1% year-on-year, 
mainly due to a lower amortizable base of intangible 
assets as a result of fully amortized assets in the year.
Operating income totaled 539 million euros in 2024, 
growing 69.7% year-on-year as a result of the good 
performance of the own brand and focused strategy 
execution driving mainly from successful commercial 
cost management and savings from digital 
transformation and energy cost optimization and lower 
depreciation and amortization.

In 2024, Telefónica Brazil maintained its leadership in the 
mobile segment and, in a more consolidated market 
environment, a market share of 38.8%, 5.7 p.p. ahead of 
its closest competitor (data from the last official 
publication of ANATEL, December 31, 2024). Telefónica 
Brazil's strategy remains focused on strengthening its 
high-value customer base. Telefónica Brazil reached a 
contract market share (excluding IoT accesses) of 43.1% 
as of December 31, 2024 (ANATEL).
In the fixed business, Telefónica Brazil continued with 
the implementation of strategic technologies, focusing 
on the deployment of fiber, centering its commercial 
offer around Vivo Total, and maintaining low churn rates.
In addition, Telefónica Brazil continued to advance in the 
development of an ecosystem with relevant partners to 
promote its consolidation as a digital services hub. To 
this end, it offers a broad portfolio of services, 
highlighting those described below:
–
Health & Wellness: Vale Saúde is a monthly 
subscription service that provides discounts for 
online or in-person medical care, exams and 
medications, through more than 3 thousand 
pharmacies and 3 thousand clinics and 
laboratories in 2024.
–
Education: Viva E is an employment platform

Total accesses stood at 116.2 million as of December 31, 
2024, increasing 2.7% year-on-year mainly due to the 
growth in contract mobile accesses thanks to Telefónica 
Brazil's totalization strategy (expanding the services we 
offer to provide customers with a complete experience) 
and the growth in FTTH, which offset the decrease in 
prepaid mobile accesses as customers migrate to hybrid 
postpaid (accesses with usage limits, requiring 
customers to purchase “top-ups” if they exceed these 
limits), the decline in the fixed voice business due to the 
continuous migration from fixed to mobile, the 
contraction of the lower-value fixed broadband 
customer base, and the loss of DTH customers as a 
result of the company’s strategic decision to discontinue 
legacy technologies.
Contract mobile accesses grew by 6.9% year-on-year 
and reached 49.1 million with net adds of 3.2 million new 
accesses in 2024, with churn at very low levels (1.0%), 
driven by the totalization strategy and by the launch of 
new attractive bundles (packaged offers with more than 
one service) in hybrid postpaid.
Prepaid mobile accesses decreased by 3.9% year-on-
year and reached 35.8 million accesses with a net loss of 
1.5 million accesses during 2024. The lower customer 
base has been mainly a consequence of the strategy of 
migrating prepaid customers to hybrid postpaid and 
focusing more on encouraging the consumption of top-
ups.
Broadband accesses grew by 8.9% year-on-year and 
reached 7.3 million accesses with net adds of 596 
thousand new accesses in 2024. Telefónica Brazil 
maintained its strategic focus on the deployment of 
fiber, reaching 7.0 million homes connected with FTTH 
as of December 2024, growing 12.7% year-on-year. 
Telefónica Brazil reached 31.5 million real estate units 
passed with FTTx access, and 7.0 million connected 
homes, which grew by 10.4% year-on-year, which 
managed to offset the decrease in other accesses of 
legacy broadband services (xDSL).
Traditional voice accesses decreased by 11.0% year-
on-year due to fixed-mobile substitution, reaching 5.7 
million accesses.
Pay TV accesses reached 785 thousand as of 
December 31, 2024, decreasing by 7.1% year-on-year, 
mainly as a result of the strategic decision to discontinue 
the DTH service.

Analysis of results
In 2024, revenues amounted to 9,618 million euros, 
decreasing by 0.3% year-on-year, mainly due to the 
depreciation of the Brazilian real, despite the growth in 
service revenues, driven by the price increases in the 
mobile business and by businesses associated with new 
technologies (FTTH and digital services).
• Mobile business revenues totaled 6,846 million 
euros in 2024, increasing 0.8% year-on-year, mainly as 
a result of the positive evolution of contract accesses 
due to the larger customer base, price increases and 
the positive evolution of digital services, partially offset 
by the depreciation of the Brazilian real.
• Fixed business revenues amounted to 2,772 million 
euros in 2024, decreasing 3.0% year-on-year, mainly 
as a result of the depreciation of the Brazilian real, 
partially offset by higher FTTH revenues, in line with 
the strategic focus on such services, and higher IT 
service revenues.
Mobile ARPU decreased 4.0% year-on-year, mainly due 
to the depreciation of the Brazilian real, despite the price 
increases carried out and the good evolution of the 
postpaid business, which was helped by the totalization 
strategy.

The evolution of expenses is explained below:
• Supplies amounted to 2,234 million euros in 2024, 
increasing 3.0% year-on-year mainly due to higher 
equipment purchases and handset costs associated 
with increased commercial activity, offset in part by 
the depreciation of the Brazilian real.
• Personnel expenses amounted to 1,218 million euros 
in 2024, decreasing 0.2% year-on-year compared to 
2023, mainly as a result of the depreciation of the 
Brazilian real, which offset salary increases 
implemented during the year.
• Other expenses amounted to 2,367 million euros in 
2024, decreasing 7.5% year-on-year compared to 
2023, impacted by the reversal of contingencies 
related to the migration from the existing concession 
regime to the new authorization model for the 
provision of fixed telephony services, the depreciation 
of the Brazilian real, tax recoveries and lower copper 
prices.
EBITDA stood at 4,116 million euros in 2024, decreasing 
by 0.3% year-on-year mainly due to the depreciation of 
the Brazilian real.
Depreciation and amortization amounted to 2,474 
million euros in 2024, decreasing 1.4% year-on-year, 
mainly due to the depreciation of the Brazilian real, 
which more than offset the higher amortizable base of 
property, plant and equipment assets associated with 
new investments.
Operating income stood at 1,642 million euros in 2024, 
increasing by 1.5%, mainly due to lower depreciation and 
amortization and positive performance in service 
revenues, as a result of increased commercial activity, 
and the impact of the reversal of contingencies related 
to the migration from the existing concession regime to 
the new authorization model for the provision of fixed 
telephony services, offset in part by the depreciation of 
the Brazilian real.

(1) Includes "fixed wireless" and Voice over IP accesses.
Telefónica Hispam's total accesses reached 108.9 
million as of December 31, 2024 (-3.3% year-on-year), 
mainly as a result of the decrease in mobile accesses.
Mobile accesses closed at 95.0 million, decreasing by 
3.0% year-on-year, mainly due to decreases in prepaid 
customers and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in contract 
customers.
• Contract accesses decreased by 3.0% year-on-year 
due to the lower accesses recorded in Colombia 
(-7.7%), Ecuador (-7.0%), Chile (-3.8%) and Argentina 
(-2.3%), partially offset by the increase in Mexico 
(+5.2%). This evolution was driven by aggressive 
competition in the postpaid markets in Colombia, 
Ecuador, Chile and Argentina and a strong increase in 
customer churn.
• Prepay accesses decreased by 4.4% year-on-year, 
resulting in a net loss of 2.9 million accesses as of 
December 31, 2024, due to a revenue-neutral 
technical customer base adjustment in Chile (-1.9 
million accesses) and Mexico (-1.1 million accesses), 
which entailed excluding inactive accesses that did 
not generate revenue over a given period of time. The 
prepay customer base was also negatively impacted 
by the aggressive competition in the prepaid markets 
in Chile, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina.
• Fixed accesses stood at 5.1 million as of December 31, 
2024 (-10.7% year-on-year), with a net loss of 610 
thousand accesses, due to the ongoing erosion of this 
business in all countries in the region.   
Fixed broadband accesses amounted to 6.0 million as 
of December 31, 2024 (-1.2% year-on-year). The 
penetration of fixed broadband accesses over traditional 
business accesses stood at 117.5% (+11.4 p.p. year-on-
year), as a result of the focus on ultra broadband (UBB) 
deployment in the region, reaching 5.7 million connected 
accesses (+4.0% y-o-y) and 25.0 million premises 
passed. The penetration of UBB accesses over fixed 
broadband accesses stood at 96.6% (+4.8 p.p. y-o-y).
Pay TV accesses stood at 2.8 million as of December 31, 
2024, a decrease of 1.8% y-o-y. This evolution is 
explained by the decline in cable accesses (-181.5 
thousand accesses) and direct-to-home accesses 
(-109.7 thousand accesses), in line with the change in 
the commercial strategy in the region, partially offset by 
the increase in IPTV accesses (+155.7 thousand 
accesses), the company's main strategic focus.

Analysis of results
Venezuela and Argentina are considered countries with 
hyperinflationary economies in 2024 and 2023, and the 
Argentine peso's exchange rate had a significant impact 
on the segment’s results in both 2024 and 2023. The 
exchange rate used to translate inflation-adjusted items 
denominated in Argentine pesos in the consolidated 
financial statements as of and for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 was the closing exchange rate as of 
December 31, 2024 which was 1,073.18 Argentine pesos 
per euro (893.45 Argentine pesos per euro as of 
December 31, 2023). The annual inflation rate in 
Argentina for 2024 was 117.8% (211.4% for 2023). As a 
result of these changes in the exchange and inflation 
rates, in 2024 Telefónica Argentina contributed 2,226 
million euros (1,237 million euros in 2023) to the 
consolidated revenues of the Telefónica Group and a 
loss of 84 million euros to operating result (199 million 
euros loss in 2023) before the 1,274 million euros 
impairment losses of intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment described below. 
Revenues amounted to 9,032 million euros in 2024, 
growing by 7.8% year-on-year. This growth was caused 
by higher B2C postpaid and prepaid revenues, higher 
revenues from B2B customers, higher revenues from 
fixed broadband and digital services and higher Pay TV 
revenues, which were partially offset by lower revenues 
from handset sales and lower fixed voice revenues.
Mobile business revenues amounted to 6,056 million 
euros in 2024, growing by 10.3% year-on-year. This 
growth was mainly due to improved B2C postpaid and 
prepaid revenues, together with the growth of revenues 
from B2B customers, partially offset by the decrease in 
handset sale revenues.
The performance by country was as follows:
• In Argentina, mobile business revenues amounted to 
1,473 million euros in 2024, growing by 70.9% year-on-
year, impacted by the higher postpaid and prepaid 
mobile revenues in 2024, partially offset by the lower 
handset sales in 2024, a consequence of the 
devaluation mentioned above.
• In Chile, mobile business revenues were 812 million 
euros in 2024, decreasing by 17.8% year-on-year, 
explained by lower handset sale revenues and lower 
B2C and B2B revenues, derived from the decrease in 
the customer base.
• In Peru, mobile business revenues were 811 million 
euros in 2024, decreasing by 3.4% year-on-year due to 
lower handset sale revenues and lower prepaid 
revenues, as a result of the lower level of top-ups.

• In Colombia, mobile business revenues were 736 
million euros in 2024, decreasing by 4.9% year-on-year 
mainly due to the decrease in the customer base and 
lower postpaid revenues, due to aggressive 
competition in the market and a related increase in 
customer churn. This decrease was partially offset by 
the exchange rate effect and higher revenues in 
prepaid B2C
• In Mexico, mobile business revenues were 1,286 million 
euros in 2024, decreasing by 2.5% year-on-year, 
negatively impacted by lower handset sale revenues, 
lower B2C prepaid revenues and exchange rate 
effects, partially compensated by higher postpaid 
revenues and B2B revenues.
Fixed business revenues amounted to 2,976 million 
euros in 2024, growing by 3.0% year-on-year, mostly 
due to higher broadband revenues and digital services 
offered in Argentina, as well as higher Pay TV revenues 
in Argentina and Colombia, partially offset by the 
decrease in fixed business revenues in Peru and Chile.
The evolution of expenses is explained below:
• Supplies amounted to 3,042 million euros in 2024, 
decreasing by 5.3% year-on-year in 2024, mainly due 
to lower handset costs in the region as a result of 
decreased commercial activity.
• Personnel expenses stood at 1,293 million euros in 
2024, up by 14.8% year-on-year, due to wage 
increases in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay, 
and higher restructuring costs in all countries in the 
region.
• Other expenses reached 5,300 million euros in 2024, 
up 89.5% year-on-year compared to 2023. This 
increase was mainly due to the recording of 
impairment losses on intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment in Argentina in an aggregate 
amount of 1,274 million euros and impairment losses on 
goodwill with respect to cash-generating units in Chile 
(397 million euros) and Peru (226 million euros). 
Additionally, Telefónica recorded in Perú impairment 
losses of intangible assets (54 million euros), 
impairment losses on held-for-sale assets 
corresponding to property, plant and equipment of the 
fiber optics business of Pangea (108 million euros) and 
goodwill (34 million euros).  In addition, there were 
higher other expenses, although to a lesser extent, 
due to an increase in network, IT and client 
management costs. 
EBITDA stood at -400 million euros in 2024, compared 
to 1,510 million euros in 2023.
Depreciation and amortization amounted to 1,651 
million euros in 2024, increasing 6.1% year-on-year, 
mainly impacted by new right of use agreements, higher 
depreciation associated with Capex in Argentina and 
higher depreciation of property, plant and equipment 
assets in Telefónica del Perú, partially offset by lower 
amortization in Telefónica Colombia, following the 
agreement with Colombia Móvil S.A. ESP for the 
implementation of a single mobile access network 
through an independent company as well as intangible 
assets fully amortized in 2024, and in Telefónica Chile 
due to a lower depreciable base of property, plant and 
equipment assets.
Operating loss stood at 2,051 million euros in 2024, 
compared to the operating loss of 47 million euros in 
2023. This increase in operating loss was mainly due to 
the impairment losses of assets described above .
Below is additional information by country:
• In Argentina, operating loss was 1,359 million euros in 
2024 compared to an operating loss of 199 million 
euros in 2023, due to the impairment of intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment mentioned 
above. 
• In Chile, operating loss was 410 million euros in 2024, 
compared to an operating income of 35 million euros 
in 2023, negatively impacted by the impairment of 
goodwill amounting 397 million euros and, to a lesser 
extent, the lower revenues mentioned above. 
• In Peru, operating loss was 592 million euros in 2024 
compared to an operating loss of 33 million euros in 
2023. This result was negatively impacted mainly by 
the recording of impairment losses on goodwill (226 
million euros), impairment losses on intangible assets 
(54 million euros) and goodwill (34 million euros). To a 
lesser extent, operating loss was impacted by the 
lower fixed and mobile revenues mentioned above and 
the higher depreciation and amortization in 2024.
• In Colombia, operating income was 155 million euros in 
2024, compared to 64 million euros in  2023, due to 
lower operating expenses and lower depreciation and 
amortization in the period.
• In Mexico, operating income reached 10 million euros 
in 2024, compared to operating income of 3 million 
euros in 2023, due to lower operating expenses and 
lower depreciation and amortization in the period, 
offset in part by lower revenues.

The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  
(EU) 2022/2464 replaces the NFRD, expanding its 
content and setting new mandatory reporting standards: 
the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). 
Under the CSRD, Member States had to incorporate the 
directive into their legal systems by 6 July 2024. In Spain, 
the draft law was submitted for consultation in May 
2023 and was approved as draft legislation on 29 
October 2024.
When this Management Report was produced, the 
CSRD had not yet been transposed into Spanish law. 
Therefore, for the 2024 financial year, Law 11/2018 
remains in force in Spain. This unprecedented situation 
has lent even more complexity to the process of 
adapting to CSRD requirements at the Company. 
Although the reporting requirements of the ESRS are 
greater than those of Spanish Law 11/2018, the latter 
requires the inclusion of certain breakdowns that are not 
envisaged by the ESRS, referring mainly to tax 
information and specific employment indicators. In turn, 
the ESRS establish certain transitional provisions.
Taking the foregoing into account, the Telefónica Group 
(hereinafter, Telefónica, the Company or the Group) has 
made every effort in preparing this Consolidated 
Statement of Non-Financial Information and 
Sustainability information  (hereinafter, the Sustainability 
Report) for 2024 so that it voluntarily complies with both 
the CSRD and ESRS and with Law 11/2018.
To enable the Sustainability Report to be easily read and 
understood, it has been structured following the order of 
the ESRS. The code provided by the Implementation 
Guidance (IG)3: List of ESRS Datapoints prepared by 
EFRAG is specified for each of the disclosure 
requirements and datapoints addressed. In addition, a 
specific internal code has been assigned for each 
impact, risk and opportunity (IROs) identified as material. 
These codes are used throughout the Report when it is 
necessary to refer to each IRO.
ESRS 1 (sections 10.1 to 10.4) sets out certain transitional 
provisions related to entity-specific disclosures, the 
value chain, the presentation of comparative information 
and a list of disclosure requirements that can be phased 
in. The Company has applied this transitional system 
throughout this Sustainability Report, provided it does 
not come into conflict with the requirements of Law 
11/2018.
BP-2_16, BP-2_17
The additional information required by Law 11/2018 is 
shown in chapter 2.17. Information required by Law 
11/2018. The following reporting frameworks have been 
considered in the preparation of this additional 
information: CSRD - ESRS and the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) Guide.
BP-1_02
Scope of consolidation
The aim of the Sustainability Report is to provide a 
comprehensive overview of the significant 
environmental, social and governance aspects of the 
companies that comprise the Telefónica Group.
The Group is made up of Telefónica, S.A. (the parent 
company) and the subsidiary companies controlled by it. 
This Sustainability Report has used the scope of 
consolidation that was used for the financial statements. 
Appendix I to the 2024 Consolidated Financial 
Statements provides a list of the main companies that 
comprise the Telefónica Group, as well as their main 
corporate purpose, country and the percentage of 
effective ownership. The Appendix also indicates the 
main changes in the scope of consolidation in the last 
two years.
In accordance with the regulations, joint ventures 
(including VMO2 in the United Kingdom) and associates 
over which significant influence is exercised (accounted 
for using the equity method in the consolidated financial 
statements) are not part of the scope of companies of 
the Sustainability Report. However, they have been 
taken into consideration, where appropriate, in the 
Group's value chain and in quantifying Scope 3 
emissions (in the Investments category, see section 
2.9.4.3. GHG emissions). The main joint ventures and 
associates are also listed in Appendix I of the 2024 
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Value chain estimation
With regard to the reporting requirements relating to the 
value chain, the Company has taken into account 
transitional provision 10.2 of ESRS 1, in particular with 
regard to disclosing parameters or metrics relating to the 
upstream and downstream stages.
In relation to the data concerning Scope 3 emissions, 
these are provided in section 2.9.4.3. GHG Emissions.
BP-2_07, BP-2_08, BP-2_09
Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty
The calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 
Telefónica’s value chain is subject to a certain degree of 
estimation uncertainty which, in this case, is a 
combination of the uncertainty in terms of the model 
and uncertainty of the parameters.
The emission factors used to conduct the GHG 
inventory for Telefónica come from official sources and 
are specific for each category of emission sources, and 
therefore the uncertainty regarding the factors is low. 
The uncertainty relating to parameters is due to the 
dependence on activity data that are external to the 
Company and do not have single or official sources or 
common methodologies. These are: the carbon footprint 
of the main suppliers; the kilometres travelled as part of  
Company employee business travel; the GHG emissions 
or energy consumption of investee companies; the 
power rating of the equipment installed in customer 
households; and the emissions from the use and 
manufacture of the mobile devices Telefónica procures 
and sells to its customers.
The data provided by suppliers regarding the emissions 
for their organisations, the power ratings of their routers 
or set-top boxes and the emissions of their mobile 
devices are assumed to be accurate, although public 
data that have been validated by an independent third 
party are prioritised. Despite these validations, the data 
from third parties are obtained from their systems and 
Telefónica does not have access to all the evidence held 
by these organisations.
In relation to the uncertainty of the model, when primary 
data are not available, the emissions by suppliers or 
equipment (routers, set-top boxes and mobile devices) 
are estimated based on supplier data or models of 
equipment for which there are data. In 2024, 72% of 
Scope 3 emissions were calculated through primary 
data.

2.2. Strategy and business model
2.2.1. The Company
SBM-1_01, SBM-1_02
Corporate profile
2024 marked an important milestone in Telefónica’s 
history. In April, the Company celebrated the 100th 
anniversary of its incorporation in Spain in 1924 with the 
mission of deploying a national telecommunications 
network, automating local telephony in large cities by 
laying cables underground, and connecting the entire 
country through a long-distance network. In the years 
since, Telefónica has grown and transformed the 
business, expanding it to its current size.
At year end, the Telefónica Group was present in 
markets in Europe (Spain, Germany and the United 
Kingdom) and Latin America (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, 
Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador, Venezuela and 
Uruguay), in which the Company provides services 
under different brands, including:
• Movistar, in Spain and Latin America.
• Vivo, in Brazil.
• O2, in Germany and Spain.
• VMO2, in the UK, through the joint venture with Liberty 
Global called VMED O2 UK (see Scope of 
consolidation in 2.1. Basis for preparation).
• Telefónica Empresas / Telefónica Tech, aimed at the 
corporate segment.
The main customer segments are:
• Residential (individuals and households).
• Corporate (SMEs, Companies, Multinationals, Public 
Administrations).
• Wholesale and other partners.
Telefónica offers its customers a broad range of 
products and services, based on the latest technologies 
available in each area. As part of its main business of 
telecommunications, Telefónica deploys state-of-the-art 
networks (based on fibre and 5G) to connect the 
societies in which it operates.
Additionally, the Group provides a large number of 
digital services to its residential customers 
(entertainment, home, security, etc.), and has developed 
a specific offering for business and public segments that 
includes, among other services, cloud services, 
cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial 
intelligence (AI) and professional services to integrate 
these solutions. Along with these, the Group provides 
wholesale services to other telecommunications 
operators and works with them on developing new 
industry solutions (for example, the Open Gateway 
initiative under the GSMA).

Mission and sustainability strategy (main 
targets)
Telefónica's mission places people at the centre of 
everything it does. It wants to be a company in which 
customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders and 
society in general can trust. Its mission consists of two 
key elements:
• Making the world more human: corporate ethics are at 
the heart of everything it does. The Company puts 
technology at the service of people and drives 
responsible digitalisation that accelerates the green 
transition. It takes into account the expectations and 
needs of different stakeholders to build relationships 
based on trust.

• Connecting people's lives: this means that it aims to 
digitalise society as a whole, leaving no one behind, 
and reduce the digital divide in terms of access, 
affordability, accessibility and training in digital skills. 
This also drives the Company to innovate, ensuring 
that it offers secure products and services that add 
value and contribute to improving people's lives, and 
to leverage digital solutions.
Committed to this mission, Telefónica integrates the 
main aspects of sustainability into its strategy, designing 
action plans to tackle the impacts, risks and 
opportunities arising from the double materiality 
analysis. These ESG commitments are reflected in the 
2024-26 Responsible Business Plan:
Transform the customer relationship
Telefónica is working on developing a new global 
customer responsibility policy aimed at building unique 
experiences based on trust.
In addition, the Company wants to expand its range of 
products and services by capitalising on the 
opportunities offered by an ESG perspective. This 
approach includes promoting Eco Smart products, 
encouraging responsible design practices and boosting 
digital inclusion through the development of accessible 
solutions with a positive social impact, among other 
measures. Through these initiatives, Telefónica seeks 
not only to set itself apart in the marketplace, but also to 
build stronger, more sustainable and longer-lasting 
relationships with its customers.
Transform the operating model
In order to generate a higher return on its investments 
and improve its resilience, the Group is committed to 
decarbonising its operations and reducing energy 
consumption by prioritising renewable sources and 
energy efficiency practices. 
It also seeks to promote the circularity of its processes in 
order to explore new business models (the reuse of 
customer equipment or mobile devices) and generate 
efficiencies. In addition, the Company is working to 
incorporate sustainability criteria into its financing, which 
is mainly reflected in the contracting of new financial 
instruments linked to ESG targets.
Transform and commit to long-term value
In order for sustainability to be a driving force for 
Telefónica's value creation, it undertakes management 
commitments that enable it, among other things, to 
position itself as a leader according to various ESG 
benchmark ratings. To achieve this, the Company 
emphasises the importance of promoting excellence in 
governance and transparency in information, 
underpinned by a strong ESG culture. 
Telefónica is considering different solutions and 
projects, among which is the implementation of wide-
ranging due diligence processes that promote the 
sustainable management of its entire value chain, as well 
as its focus on human talent through practices that 
prioritise employee well-being, improve their skills and 
promote diversity.
SBM-1_21, SBM-1_22
Telefónica’s Responsible Business Plan includes 
measures, monitoring indicators and targets in all its 
pillars. This Plan and the objectives it defines are 
corporate in scope, and therefore impact breakdowns of 
groups of products and services, customer categories, 
geographic areas and stakeholders of the Company.
The action plans or strategic measures, as well as 
specific targets, are described in each of the chapters of 
this Report on each topic, together with their specific 
characteristics.
2.2.3. How Telefónica creates value
In accordance with Telefónica's mission to “make our 
world more human by connecting people’s lives”, 
Telefónica develops an integrated telecommunications 
operator model in its major markets. The Company 
invests directly in the deployment and operation of 
networks and develops a broad range of connectivity-
based products for end customers.
This business model enables Telefónica to position itself 
as an integral supplier of telecommunications services, 
with an offering that is tailored to the changing needs of 
its customers and the technological demands of the 
market.
Business model
SBM-1_25
Deployment, operation and maintenance of 
networks
As an integrated operator (with a network), Telefónica 
invests in deployment and operates a 
telecommunications network that includes fixed and 
mobile network infrastructure. This provides wide 
coverage and quality connectivity for residential and 
corporate customers. The Company deploys next-
generation technology, such as fibre optic networks and 
high-speed connections, to ensure access to ultra 
broadband and meet the increasing demand for data 
from its customers.
To provide the service, the Company invests in the 
acquisition of spectrum licences that enable it to 
operate its mobile networks at different frequencies. 
This includes complying with regulator rules to foster 
legal and uninterrupted operations, ensuring the quality 
and continuity of the services.

With the move towards software-defined networking 
(SDN) and the opening up of APIs, Telefónica can rapidly 
adapt to the needs of its customers and enable 
personalised services. This facilitates integration of 
third-party services and enhances operational flexibility. 
In this new network environment, operators have 
become coordinators of numerous layers and services. 
Telefónica not only provides connectivity but also 
integrates many different services through centralised 
network management, thereby allowing for real-time 
configuration and permitting the optimisation of network 
use and, consequently, of energy consumption.
In certain market environments, the Company leverages 
infrastructure sharing models with other operators, 
particularly in less densely populated areas, thereby 
maximising the efficiency of capital and reducing the 
environmental impact. Telefónica also explores 
innovative investment models to finance network 
deployment, such as joint ventures and associations 
with infrastructure funds.
Development and bundling of products and 
services for customers
In most markets, Telefónica is developing a convergent 
offering that combines fixed and mobile connectivity 
services, TV and digital services, designing packages 
that increase value for customers. In addition to offering 
fixed and mobile telephony, the Company provides high-
speed Internet and quality mobile data, tailored to 
different needs (businesses, households, etc.).
Telefónica offers subscription TV through IPTV and OTT 
services (over proprietary or third-party platforms), 
which enables access to content both on traditional 
devices and through streaming. Local operators acquire 
broadcasting rights, develop their own content in some 
markets and collaborate with other content producers to 
deliver exclusivity and additional value in their TV 
offering.
In addition to connectivity, Telefónica develops its own 
digital products and associates with third parties to offer 
their services in areas such as security, entertainment, 
education and energy.
For corporations, Telefónica supplies integrated 
connectivity, cloud services and professional services 
(cybersecurity, data analysis, IoT) packages, backed by a 
network of alliances with leading technology firms.
Lastly, Telefónica has a range of wholesale options 
aimed mainly at other operators, both in compliance 
with current regulations in each market and through 
commercial agreements.
Relationship with end customers and other 
stakeholders
Telefónica has a direct relationship with its end 
customers throughout all the significant customer 
journey touchpoints, with the goal of ensuring service 
quality and increasing customer satisfaction (measured 
in terms of the Net Promoter Score or NPS, see ESRS S4 
section 2.13.3. Action plans, metrics and targets). It 
therefore makes available different sales and after-sales 
service channels, including stores, the Internet and 
mobile applications, to ensure access and convenience 
for end customers.
The Company uses data analysis and AI to understand 
and segment its customers, enabling personalised offers 
that improve retention and satisfaction. Telefónica 
implements customer data protection and privacy 
measures through advanced cybersecurity tools and 
protection policies that meet international standards. As 
regards the use of AI tools, Telefónica has made public 
its position regarding the need for the ethical use of 
technology, with the dual objective of mitigating risks—
thereby building trust—and promoting innovation.
Telefónica enables access for all the potential customer 
segments, with brands and portfolios adapted to the 
markets in which it operates. For this purpose, it extends 
the coverage of its networks and facilitates access to its 
services for groups with different abilities, fostering their 
access to digitalisation.
While providing connectivity or digital services, 
Telefónica also supplies its customers with the most 
appropriate hardware devices for each service. At the 
end of the life cycle of these products, it rolls out 
initiatives for reuse, recycling and safe disposal of 
network or customer equipment.
Main operations of the Telefónica Group
In order to develop its business model, Telefónica is 
present in many different markets, in which it operates 
its networks and serves its end customers. The Group 
operates locally in markets where its market share 
enables it to be a major operator and obtain economies 
of scale.

Value chain
Telefónica’s value chain encompasses the activities, 
resources and relationships involved in the business 
model of a company and in the external context in which 
it operates. That is, it encompasses all the elements 
needed to create products and services, from the initial 
idea to their delivery, consumption and end of life. A 
summary of the main characteristics of the value chain 
that have been taken into consideration and specifically 
developed, is provided below:

A compilation of the main agents in the value chain is

persons or entities involved in one or more of the three 
elements of the value chain:
• Upstream agents: those who participate in the value 
chain before products or services reach the main 
organisation. They are usually involved in supply chain 
activities and are key for starting the activity. They 
include services suppliers, goods suppliers, other 
suppliers and banks.
• Operations agents: those who conduct activities and 
form key relationships to be able to develop the 
products and services that are subsequently 
marketed. They include Telefónica's own employees, 
collaborating companies (contractors), and other 
operators.
• Downstream agents: those who are involved after the 
product or service has left the organisation and are 
essential to the distribution, use and after-sales 
stages. They include B2B customers, B2C customers, 
call centres and advertising and marketing agencies.
Finally, consideration has also been given to the main 
distribution channels that form part of the value chain, 
the purpose of which is to connect the operations with 
consumers and end-users.
In the products and services marketing stage, the 
following channels must be highlighted: shops, 
telephone customer services and digital platforms, as 
well as the distribution and logistics services needed to 
deliver the products and services. The after-sales stage 
contains the various customer service channels (in-
person and remote), as well as technical support and the 
repair service.
2.2.4. Stakeholder management and 
relations 
SBM-2_01, SBM-2_05
Telefónica manages its relationship with interested 
parties and users of the information (stakeholders) with 
the aim of building mutual value, forging links that 
enable the Company to align its expectations with those 
of its stakeholders. This approach enables the building of 
trusting relationships, the identification of significant 
topics and the anticipation of sustainability trends, 
promoting the long-term durability of the Company.
SBM-2_04
Stakeholder management and relations 
strategy
In 2024, the Company updated its process of identifying 
and prioritising stakeholders. Through this process, the 
main stakeholders were identified and segmented 
throughout the entire value chain.
With this complete picture, Telefónica carried out a 
prioritisation process based on an evaluation of 
influence and interest. As regards influence, factors that 
were considered include the direct impact of the 
stakeholders on the Company’s operations, the level of 
dependence on its activities or the frequency of 
interactions. In terms of interest, the Group assessed 
variables such as the degree of direct involvement, the 
level of interest during critical or emergency situations or 
the importance they attach to the image and reputation 
of the Company.
As a result of this process, the following stakeholders 
have been identified:

SBM-2_03
In addition, as a result of prioritisation, Telefónica 
establishes different forms of interaction and 
involvement with its stakeholders. Although the 
Company collaborates with all groups, it designs 
different types of interaction based on their expectations 
and needs:
• For the main groups (high influence and high interest), 
continuous and bidirectional communication is 
implemented, fostering their active participation and 
gathering their expectations in order to integrate them 
into strategic decisions and the definition of 
sustainability policies.
• For latent groups (high influence and low interest), 
timely strategic communication is maintained, 
promoting their awareness of relevant issues that may 
impact their interests without requiring their constant 
participation.
• For informed groups (low influence and high interest), 
they are kept informed on a regular basis through the 
different channels and forms of relationship, so that 
they can understand how the Company's decisions 
may affect their interests.
• For monitored groups (low influence and low interest), 
communication is carried out on an occasional basis,  
sufficient to keep them informed about aspects that 
may be important to them for their decision making.
In line with this approach, for the main stakeholders 
identified through the prioritisation process, a mapping 
of the channels and forms of relationship has been 
carried out. This analysis allows the Company to adapt 
the interaction channels to the specific characteristics 
and needs of each group, in order to have bidirectional 
communication that integrates both the global and local 
approach.
As a result of this process, the Company has identified 
the main channels and forms of general and specific

MDR-P_05
This breakdown of the channels and forms of 
relationship allows the Company to identify which are 
best placed for learning the expectations of 
stakeholders. The analysis of these expectations 
provides information for establishing, modifying and 
updating policies and procedures for those issues that 
directly affect them.
MDR-T_11, SBM-2_06
It also serves as a source of information when setting 
targets to promote positive impacts, seize opportunities, 
and mitigate or avoid negative impacts and risks. This 
methodology allows management and strategic 
decisions to be aligned with the needs and expectations 
of the Company's main stakeholders.
Additionally, stakeholder expectations and needs are 
integrated throughout the double materiality process. 
For more details on how they are considered in each of 
the phases of the materiality assessment, see:
 2.3.1. Double materiality process
SBM-2_07, SBM-2_08, SBM-2_09
Knowledge of stakeholder expectations and needs 
enables the Company to adapt its business model to 
strengthen key relationships and competitiveness in the 
market. Likewise, these expectations and needs are 
reflected in the Company's strategy, which incorporates 
the main sustainability aspects arising from the double 
materiality result. Therefore, any changes in stakeholder 
expectations are reflected in Telefónica's strategy 
through the action plans in place to manage the material 
impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) identified.
SBM-2_10, SBM-2_11
Over the course of 2025, the Group will perform an 
analysis of the established channels and forms of 
relationship in order to identify areas for improvement 
and develop specific action plans for addressing them, in 
order to manage its capacity to respond and adapt to its 
stakeholders' expectations.
SBM-2_12
In addition, and in accordance with the provisions of the 
Regulations of the Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A., 
one of the duties of the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee is to manage stakeholders, specifically:
• To promote a proactive relationship strategy with  
stakeholders, with the purpose of defining the material 
issues affecting the Company from impact, risk and 
opportunity perspectives.
• To ensure that the corporate culture is aligned with 
the Company's purpose and values and to act 
transparently towards stakeholders.
In addition, the Global Sustainability (ESG) Department 
is the area responsible for reporting annually to the 
Company’s Sustainability and Regulation Committee on 
the opinions and the interests of stakeholders with 
regard to the Company's strategy and business model.
Likewise, the Chairman of the Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee, Mr. Francisco Javier de Paz 
Mancho, reports the main matters dealt with at its 
respective sessions (including stakeholder interests and 
opinions) to the meetings of the Board of Directors, 
ensuring that the most significant issues in terms of 
sustainability are taken into consideration in the 
deliberations of the Board of Directors.

2.3. Materiality
2.3.1. Double materiality process
In 2024, Telefónica updated its double materiality 
process in line with the requirements established by the 
European Directive 2022/2464 on Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting (CSRD), the European 
Commission’s Delegated Regulation 2023/2772, which 
includes the new European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ESRS), as well as the implementation guides 
IG1 (Materiality Assessment) and IG2 (Value Chain) 
drawn up by the European Financial Reporting Advisory 
Group (EFRAG). 
SBM-3_03
This process helps to integrate material sustainability 
issues into the Company’s strategy and decision making. 
In addition, it ensures that Company policies, action 
plans, metrics and targets are aligned with their critical 
issues from a dual perspective:
• Financial materiality: impacts on the Company's value 
or social, environmental and governance aspects that 
affect its financial profitability and capacity to create 
value for shareholders and investors from the 
perspective of risks and opportunities.  
• Impact materiality: negative and positive impacts of 
the Company’s activities on society and the 
environment, including those affecting human rights.
IRO-1_13
The double materiality process has determined which 
sustainability standards and issues (topics, sub-topics 
and sub-subtopics) are material for Telefónica and must 
be considered in the Sustainability Report.
SBM-3_11, IRO-1_15
This analysis is reviewed annually. As this is the first year 
of applying the aforementioned regulations, it is not 
possible conduct a full comparison with the previous 
year.
A four-stage process was followed: context analysis, 
identification and assessment of impacts, risks and 
opportunities (IROs), consolidation of the assessments 
and results, and, lastly, validation of the double 
materiality process.
2.3.1.1. Context analysis
The context analysis allows Telefónica to determine 
which topics must be taken into account when 
identifying and assessing impacts, risks and 
opportunities. 
The first step is to take the list of topics, subtopics and 
sub-subtopics (sustainability issues) included in AR 16 of 
ESRS 1 and analyse the internal and external 
sustainability context that may affect the organisation 
and the context in which it operates. 
Details of the sources and stakeholders considered at 
this stage are explained below:
Internal sources 
• Telefónica’s value chain: activities, resources and 
relationships involved in the Company’s business 
model and the external context in which it operates, 
the products and services offered, regions and 
analysis of the agents and the nature of the Group’s 
commercial relationships throughout the value chain. 
• Telefónica’s due diligence process on human rights 
and the environment. 
• Report on Telefónica’s Socio-economic Contribution.
• Report on Telefónica’s impacts and dependencies on 
natural capital at a corporate level.
• Telefónica's Climate Action Plan 2024.
• Company strategy.
• Telefónica’s risk management model and risk map.
• Other environmental reports.
• Telefónica's Materiality 2023.

External sources 
• Global ESG regulatory context: analysis of 
international environmental, social and corporate 
governance standards.
• Industry peers: materiality matrices of comparable 
companies in Telefónica sector.
• Analysts and investors: expectations of the Company's 
investors and ESG rating analysts such as MSCI, 
Moody’s, S&P and Sustainalytics.
• Sectoral reports: global, specific and emerging 
sustainability trends, challenges and risks.
• Sector standards: SASB sector materiality.
Stakeholders
The expectations of Telefónica's key stakeholder groups 
were analysed through an examination of the various 
types of channels and forms of engaging with them in 
order to identify the priority issues and their degree of 
involvement in the double materiality process. The 
process of identifying, prioritising and engaging with 
stakeholders is outlined in the following section of 
chapter 2.2. Strategy and business model:
 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations
Furthermore, consultations were carried out with the 
different stakeholder groups (such as NGOs, public 
institutions, business partners and sector associations) 
under the scope of the due diligence process. 
Accordingly, interviews were conducted with both 
internal and external stakeholders in order to assess the 
adverse impacts of Telefónica’s activity on the 
environment and human rights throughout its value 
chain. Among the topics addressed were those related 
to digital inclusion, the responsible use of new 
technologies, child protection, freedom of expression 
and information, privacy, cybersecurity, working 
conditions, health and safety, diversity and non-
discrimination, climate change, circular economy, 
biodiversity and water resources.
The context analysis resulted in the determination and 
selection of the topics to consider when identifying and 
assessing IROs. 
IRO-1_01, IRO-1_14 
2.3.1.2. Identification and assessment of 
IROs
IRO-1_02
Identification of impacts 
The positive and negative impacts represent the effect 
that Telefónica could have on the environment and 
people as a result of its strategy, business model or value 
chain. 
They are identified from the list of topics, subtopics and 
sub-subtopics selected during the previous stage. The 
areas of the Company responsible for the different 
matters within the organisation participated directly in 
this process, identifying, assessing and validating the 
different impacts. 
In particular, when identifying the impacts, the following 
was considered: 
IRO-1_03, IRO-1_04
• Whether these impacts occur as part of the 
Company's own operations or as a result of its 
business relationships. To determine this, account is 
taken of the activities within the value chain that 
generate impacts, the parties involved and the specific 
geographies for impacts with a local scope. 
IRO-1_05
• Stakeholders who may be affected by these impacts. 
Positive impacts
IRO-1_14
The main source of information for identifying the 
positive impacts was Telefónica’s Socio-economic 
Contribution Report.
The impacts were measured and monetised in 
accordance with guidelines provided by organisations 
such as:
• Harvard Business School (HBS).
• The Value Balancing Alliance (VBA).
• The World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD).
• The Capitals Coalition.
The Capitals Coalition, in collaboration with the VBA and 
the WBCSD, has published the report General Guidance 
on Applying the Natural Capital Management 
Accounting Methodology, which outlines the impact 
measurement process.
Negative impacts
The starting point for the process of identifying the 
negative impacts was the Human Rights and 
Environmental Impact Assessment and an analysis of the 
2023 Due Diligence Process. This allowed the impacts to 
be pre-identified with the expert knowledge of an 
independent third party and the perspective of 
management areas on various topics.

Impact assessment 
IRO-1_06
Once identified, the positive and negative impacts were 
assessed according to the following variables: 
Positive 
impacts
Potential
If there is an economic valuation: 
MAGNITUDE (Economic valuation + Scope + Scale), PROBABILITY (Likelihood of impact x Time horizon)
If there is no economic valuation: 
MAGNITUDE (Scope + Scale), PROBABILITY (Likelihood of impact x Time horizon)
Positive 
impacts
Actual
If there is an economic valuation: 
MAGNITUDE (Economic valuation + Scope + Scale)
If there is no economic valuation: 
MAGNITUDE (Scope + Scale)
Negative 
impacts
Potential
SEVERITY (Scope + Scale + Remediability), PROBABILITY (Likelihood of impact x Time horizon)  
In the event that the impact affects human rights, a greater weight is assigned to the severity so that it 
prevails over probability 
Negative 
impacts
Actual
SEVERITY (Scope + Scale + Remediability) 
Definition of the variables considered in the 
assessment
The magnitude comprises the scale, scope and 
economic valuation (if applicable). The probability is the 
likelihood of the impact multiplied by the time horizon of 
the potential impact.
• Scale: the level of importance attributed to each 
impact by affected stakeholders. This information is 
derived from consultations and studies conducted via 
the Company's different engagement channels. For 
more details, see:
 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations
• Scope: extent of the impact (global, regional, national, 
local or specific).
• Economic valuation: for positive impacts only; the 
quantified and monetised economic impact on 
affected individuals and resources.
• Irremediability: for negative impacts only; the degree 
of difficulty involved in counteracting or correcting the 
damage caused. It is weighted based on whether 
action is needed to mitigate the impact or whether it is 
irreparable.
• Impact probability: likelihood of the impact occurring. 
Qualitative information is used to assess and justify 
this variable.
• Time horizon: when the impact is most likely to 
materialise (short-, medium- and long-term).
IRO-1_07, IRO-1_08
Identification of risks and opportunities
The risks and opportunities stem from external 
sustainability events or conditions that could cause a 
negative effect, in terms of risks, or a positive effect for 
Telefónica’s economic value, in terms of opportunities.
As with impacts, the identification of risks and 
opportunities includes the activities within Telefónica’s 
value chain in which they occur and the actors that are 
involved.
Risks
IRO-1_10
Given the nature of the business and its sustainability 
context, Telefónica is exposed to various types of ESG 
(environmental, social and governance) risks and 
opportunities. The risk management process takes the 
Company’s strategy and targets as a reference point for 
identifying the main risks that could affect their 
achievement. The process includes sustainability-linked 
risks and aims to analyse, control and prevent potential 
business repercussions. 
Therefore, ESG risks, just like the other financial, 
business, operational or legal and compliance risks, are 
part of Telefónica’s Risk Management Model and are 
also identified, assessed and managed by the managers 
of the corresponding areas as part of the Telefónica 
Group’s overall risk management process. 
The identification of risks within the materiality process 
took into account those arising from a negative impact 
as well as those resulting from a dependence on human 
or environmental resources.

IRO-1_14
Telefónica’s Global Risk Management Model (ERM) is 
the main source of information.
IRO-1_12
Based on the risk management exercise, which the 
Company performs regularly, an analysis of the risks 
reported by the Group’s companies and their 
relationship with the topics of the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) is carried out. 
The results are shared with the global management 
areas, which use them to support the identification and 
assessment of their own risks in accordance with the 
CSRD. 
Therefore, the identification and assessment of risks 
associated with negative impacts on society and the 
environment are based on the available information from 
the Company risk map. It is expected that further 
progress will be made in aligning the CSRD 
requirements with the Company’s ERM.
IRO-1_07 
Opportunities
To identify opportunities, the Group connects each of 
the associated topics of the standards to its strategic 
plan, allowing it to define rationales and performance 
indicators with different opportunity scenarios.
Assessment of risks and opportunities
The risk assessment took into account the parameters 
used within Telefónica’s global risk process. 
The opportunity assessment used a proprietary 
methodology developed by Telefónica’s strategy team. 
Under this methodology, a benchmark monetary 
performance indicator is defined and different scenarios 
are proposed to estimate the economic value of the 
opportunity. Various Telefónica reports such as the 
Climate Action Plan, the sustainable financing plans and 
the Strategic Plan were used as sources for the 
assessment.
IRO-1_09
The metrics used in the assessment followed the below 
framework:
Financial 
materiality
Risks
POTENTIAL MAGNITUDE x PROBABILITY (Likelihood of occurrence x Time horizon)
When the risk is reputational: 
CURRENT REPUTATIONAL MAGNITUDE x PROBABILITY (Likelihood of occurrence x Time horizon)
Financial 
materiality
Opportunities
POTENTIAL MAGNITUDE x PROBABILITY (Likelihood of occurrence x Time horizon)
Definition of the variables considered in the 
assessment 
• Potential magnitude: the potential impact the risk 
could have in financial terms. For risks, the parameters 
recorded in the ERM were used. Meanwhile, for 
opportunities, a benchmark performance indicator 
was chosen to calculate the magnitude of the 
opportunity for different scenarios. 
• Reputational magnitude: considered for risks only; the 
potential impact the reputational risk could have.
• Probability of the risk or opportunity: likelihood of the 
risk or opportunity occurring, assessed using 
qualitative information.
• Time horizon: when the risk is most likely to materialise 
(short-, medium- and long-term).
IRO-2_13
2.3.1.3. Result of the double materiality 
analysis
Following the assessment of the IROs linked to topics, 
subtopics and sub-subtopics that are potentially 
material for Telefónica, all the identifications and 
assessments were consolidated to facilitate a joint 
analysis of the data obtained. This approach allows for a 
comprehensive overview of all the IROs to avoid 
inconsistencies between the data. This allowed the 
Company to ensure that no significant information was 
omitted. 
Furthermore, the assessments were standardised in 
order to: 
• ensure data comparability.
• ensure that negative impacts or risks were not being 
underestimated or positive impacts or opportunities 
favoured.
Lastly, following analysis and standardisation, a uniform 
threshold for impact and financial materiality was set at 
two on a scale from one to five.

Resilience of the business model 
Telefónica operates in a rapidly changing social, political, 
economic and business environment. It must constantly 
adapt to technological and regulatory changes as well 
as evolving customer preferences. To this end, 
Telefónica annually reviews its business strategy and 
updates it, normally, in the medium term. This period can 
change depending on different circumstances in 
Telefónica's context. The Group has mechanisms to:
• Maintain the necessary flexibility to address potential 
strategic risks that cannot be directly controlled (e.g. 
the macroeconomic or geopolitical environment).
• Identify, control and mitigate operational and business 
risks, ensuring the resilience of its business model (e.g. 
cybersecurity or regulatory, technological or 
competitive environments).
• Capitalise on the new business opportunities arising 
from changes in demand and technological 
developments (e.g. the development of new services 
or business models).
Within this volatile and changing environment, 
Telefónica has a comprehensive risk management

identifying and managing risks involves all company 
employees, with the Audit and Control Committee 
responsible for supervision.
2.3.2. Linking material impacts to the 
strategy and the business model
SBM-3_05
The impacts have been identified and assessed based 
on their connection with Telefónica’s strategy and 
business model, details of which are provided in the 
Strategy chapter. This relationship helps us understand 
how material impacts influence the Company’s 
operations, value proposition and ability to achieve 
strategic goals. 
The IRO tables for material standards outline the 
impacts associated with the strategy (Transform the 
customer relationship, Transform the operational model, 
Transform and commit to long-term value) and the 
business model (Deployment, operation, and 
maintenance of networks; Development and packaging 
of products and services; Relationships with customers 
and other stakeholders). Below is a description of how 
these impacts are connected:

Consolidated Annual Report 2024
Telefónica, S. A.
53

Given the increasing importance of transparency and 
reliability in sustainability reporting, in 2019, Telefónica 
initiated a project to strengthen its Internal Control over 
Sustainability Reporting (ICSR) System, in accordance 
with the international internal control standards 
established by COSO (Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission).
A key priority of this project is to review and reinforce 
internal controls in the IRO determination and 
assessment process, as this is essential for defining the 
Company’s material information. 
Therefore, this process is supported by various control 
mechanisms:
• Group Internal Control Policy: defines the criteria of 
Telefónica’s Corporate Internal Control Model, 
applicable to all entities that make up the Group.
• Corporate Regulations on the Registration, 
Communication and Control of Financial and  
Sustainability Information: describes the phases of the 
sustainability report, including the double materiality 
analysis process.
• Sustainability reporting instructions: define the 
procedures and methodology for identifying and 
assessing the IROs.
• RACI matrix: specifies the areas involved in the 
process of identifying and assessing IROs, as well as 
their respective roles.
• Digitalisation of double materiality: a tool has been 
used to identify and assess IROs, which contributes to 
the consolidation and traceability of the results.
Furthermore, during the implementation and definition 
of the double materiality analysis, Telefónica has worked 
on the initial establishment of the end-to-end process 
for determining and assessing IROs. Due to its 
complexity and early development stage, the Company 
will continue enhancing internal controls in the future by 
identifying risks and designing additional safeguards.
2.3.5. Disclosure requirements 
covered in this report
IRO-2_01, IRO-2_02
The disclosure requirements covered in the 
Sustainability Report, following the outcome of the 
double materiality assessment, as well as the datapoints

2.4. Governance
2.4.1. Introduction 
Telefónica has a Corporate Governance System that 
sets out the governance processes, controls and 
procedures for controlling, managing and supervising 
sustainability issues. In this regard, the Company's code 
of ethics and conduct called the Responsible Business 
Principles constitutes, as a whole, its Sustainability 
Policy and serves as the basis for acting and making 
decisions with integrity, commitment and transparency.
In relation to sustainability matters, Telefónica aspires to 
play a major role in the communities in which it is 
present, internalising the impacts of its activities on 
society and the environment in its strategy and the way 
it operates. Its aim in this regard is to make the world 
more human by connecting people’s lives; this entails  
contribute to generating a positive impact through its 
products and services and taking great care to minimise 
any negative impact that its activities may cause. 
Ultimately, it is about being an ethical and responsible 
company, and Telefónica’s strategy and governance 
reflect that goal.
Sustainability is managed at the Company in a cross-
cutting manner, in which the main administrative, 
management and supervisory bodies, and the areas 
involved in sustainability (local and corporate) at the 
Telefónica Group are joint participants.

On the other hand, the members of the Board of 
Directors of Telefónica, S.A., as a whole, have knowledge 
and professional experience in different matters, areas 
and sectors related to the Telefónica Group. Likewise, 
the Company's Directors have, as a whole, international

Telefónica is present.
2.4.2.2. Operation of the administrative, 
management and supervisory bodies
The Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. is the highest 
management and representative body of the Company. 
It is therefore authorised to carry out, within the scope of 
the corporate purpose established in the Company's By-
Laws, any acts or legal transactions of administration 
and disposition of property, upon any legal title, except 
for those acts or transactions which are reserved by law 
or by the By-Laws exclusively to the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting.
The Board of Directors is basically configured as a 
supervising and controlling body, with the day-to-day 
management of the Company’s affairs being entrusted 
to the management decision-making bodies and the 
management team.
Both the By-Laws and the Regulations of the Board 
provide for the existence of an Executive Committee of 
the Board of Directors with general decision-making 
powers and, therefore, with an express delegation of all 
powers of the Board of Directors (other than those that 
may not be delegated under the law or the By-Laws), as 
well as for the existence of an Audit and Control 
Committee and a Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee.
In addition, the Regulations of the Board empower the 
Board of Directors to establish one or more advisory or 
monitoring Committees,  in addition to those mentioned 
above, entrusted with the examination and permanent 
monitoring of some area that is  particularly relevant for 
the proper governance of the Company or for the 
specific review of some aspect or issue for which the 
significance or degree of importance makes this 
appropriate. These Committees report to the Board of 
Directors regarding the conclusions reached on the 
issues or matters that they have been entrusted to 
review.

Functions and responsibilities of the Board of 
Directors and of the Committees of the Board 
of Directors
GOV-1_08, GOV-1_09
In accordance with Article 5 of the Regulations of the 
Board of Directors, the Board of Directors is the body 
responsible for determining the general policies and 
strategies of the Company.
The Board of Directors is responsible, in particular and 
among other issues, for approving the Strategic Plan, the 
management goals and the Corporate Social 
Responsibility and Sustainability Policy, for determining 
the Policy for the Control and Management of Risks, 
including tax risks, and for supervising the internal 
information and control policies.
In this respect, it is also the body that approves the 
Group’s Responsible Business Principles and the 
Responsible Business Plan, which make up, respectively, 
the ethical framework and the roadmap for 
sustainability, as stated earlier. It is also responsible for 
approving all the relevant policies and regulations on this 
subject. See section:
 2.15. Policies
The Sustainability and Regulation Committee conducts 
monitoring, among other aspects, of the implementation 
of the Responsible Business Plan at its monthly 
meetings. Additionally, it performs permanent 
monitoring of the main sustainability issues; it receives 
reports on the double materiality results and the 
impacts, risks and opportunities identified, and it 
supervises the strategies, policies and impact analyses 
linked to the responsible business strategy, both from a 
business perspective and from the perspective of the 
impact on society, and in particular human rights and the 
environment, as well as the legal modifications, 
recommendations and best business practices.
In addition, the two other Board Committees also play a 
significant role in terms of sustainability, in the following 
respects:
• The Audit and Control Committee supervises and 
assesses the process of preparing, submitting and 
ensuring the integrity of the financial and sustainability 
information, and supervises the effectiveness of the 
internal control and risk management system 
(including sustainability risks).
• The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee supervises the variable 
remuneration systems of the Directors and senior 
executive officers, which comprise, among other 
aspects, objectives linked to sustainability.
The functions of the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee therefore include:
• Reporting to the Audit and Control Committee on 
sustainability risks and the process of preparing, 
presenting and ensuring the integrity of sustainability 
information.
• Informing the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee about the 
sustainability-related indicators of the Directors' and 
senior executive officers' variable remuneration 
systems, in order to facilitate their better contribution 
to the Company's sustainability strategy and long-
term interests.
Additionally, the Regulations of the Board of Directors of 
the Company stipulate that the primary duty of the Audit 
and Control Committee is to support the Board of 
Directors in its supervisory duties, and specifically, 
among other tasks, it has the following sustainability-
related powers and duties:
• Supervise the efficiency of the systems for the control 
and management of financial and non-financial risks 
relating to the Company and the Group (including 
operational, technological, legal, social, environmental, 
political and reputational risks and corruption-related 
risks).
• Supervise the risk control and management unit, 
which shall perform the following duties:
– Ensure the successful operation of the risk control 
and management systems, and particularly ensure 
that all material risks affecting the Company are 
properly identified, managed and quantified.
– Actively participate in preparing the risk strategy and 
in important decisions regarding the management 
thereof.
– Endeavour to ensure that the risk control and 
management systems successfully mitigate risks 
within the framework of the policy determined by 
the Board of Directors.
Management’s role in the governance 
processes, controls and procedures
GOV-1_10, GOV-1_11, GOV-1_12, GOV-1_13
At management level, and as an antechamber to the 
Board of Directors and its Committees, Telefónica has an 
Executive Committee which twice a month brings 
together the key individuals responsible for the 
management of all areas of the Company.
Specifically, at December 31, 2024, this Committee was 
made up of the Executive Chairman, the Chief Operating 
Officer, the main individuals responsible for the 
corporate areas of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability, 
Finance, Strategy, People, Technology and General 
Secretariat, as well as the principal figures responsible 
for the local business units.

Its multi-disciplinary composition makes it possible to 
address the various issues with a cross-cutting and 
business-based vision. As regards sustainability, these 
issues include:
– The monitoring of the Responsible Business Plan 
and the sustainability-linked performance objectives 
set (including those relating to remuneration).
– Supervision of the status of the reporting and 
control processes relating to sustainability 
information.
– Analysis of materiality for the Group (impacts, risks 
and opportunities).
Additionally, the Internal Audit area carries out the 
following control functions, reporting directly to the 
Audit and Control Committee:
– It coordinates the design and implementation 
activities of the internal control structures of the end 
to end processes for the preparation and reporting 
of sustainability information.
– It reviews the conceptual definition and 
implementation of internal control structures for 
sustainability information in accordance with the 
audit plan and applicable standards.
– It promotes the internal control culture with the 
management areas responsible for key data required 
for sustainability information.
– It establishes and maintains a program of systematic 
audits of source data and of the process of 
preparing the sustainability information through 
design and operational audits of internal control 
structures under construction or already in place.
– It prepares communications and presentations to 
the Audit and Control Committee.
– It prepares and communicates to the Audit and 
Control Committee the Internal Audit plan related to 
sustainability issues related to the reporting aspects 
of sustainability information.
Telefónica’s Compliance Department is the area 
responsible for regularly reporting, through the Chief 
Compliance Officer, to the Company's Audit and Control 
Committee on the main aspects of the Telefónica 
Group’s compliance program, see section:
 2.14.4. Compliance
GOV-1_14
As previously mentioned, the Board of Directors is 
responsible for approving the Group’s Responsible 
Business Principles and the Responsible Business Plan, 
which make up, respectively, the ethical framework and 
the roadmap for sustainability.
In addition, the Committees of the Board of Directors 
(the Sustainability and Regulation Committee, the Audit 
and Control Committee and the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee) 
support the Board in its task of supervising sustainability 
management.
In this respect, the Board of Directors and its 
Committees regularly assess the Group’s performance in 
sustainability-related areas. This is done, on the one 
hand, through the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee's supervision of the implementation of the 
Responsible Business Plan at its monthly meetings, and 
on the other, through the participation at the sessions, 
on a regular basis, of the areas of the Company that 
manage sustainability, which are those that take on the 
implementation of the targets of the Responsible 
Business Plan and generate and manage quantitative or 
qualitative indicators of this type as they fall under their 
responsibility.
In addition, and given the importance of this issue for the 
Group, some of the most significant targets of the 
Responsible Business Plan are part of the objectives set 
to determine the variable remuneration of its employees.
2.4.2.3. The expertise and skills of the 
administrative, management and 
supervisory bodies on sustainability matters 
and access to such expertise and skills
GOV-1_15, GOV-1_16
Telefónica S.A. has a Diversity Policy in relation to the 
Telefónica, S.A. Board of Directors and the Selection of 
Directors, which ensures that the Director selection 
procedures are based on prior analysis of the 
competencies required by the Board of Directors and 
favour diversity in terms of knowledge (which includes 
sustainability), training, professional experience, age and 
gender, and candidates are free of any implicit bias 
entailing any kind of discrimination.
This is all to ensure that the composition of the Board of 
Directors is appropriate, diverse and balanced overall, so 
that it i) enriches analysis and debate, ii) contributes 
diverse perspectives and positions, iii) favours decision 
making that takes into account the nature and 
complexity of the business, as well as the social and 
environmental context, iv) enjoys the greatest 
independence, and v) makes it possible to meet the legal 
requirements and good governance recommendations 
in relation to the composition and suitability 
requirements that the members of the various internal 
supervisory Committees of the Board of Directors must 
meet.
Furthermore, the Director candidate selection process 
begins with prior analysis of the competencies required 
by the Board of Directors. This analysis is conducted by 
the Company’s Board of Directors, with the advice and

following a report or proposal, where appropriate, from 
the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee.
The Board of Directors and the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, 
within the scope of their respective powers, ensure that 
the candidates chosen are persons of recognised 
calibre, qualifications and experience, who are willing to 
devote the necessary time and effort to their duties, and 
they must take extreme care in the selection of the 
persons to be appointed as independent Directors.
In relation to this, all the candidates for Director shall be 
professionals of integrity, whose conduct and 
professional career is aligned with Telefónica’s 
Responsible Business Principles.
Individuals with training and professional experience in 
telecommunications, technology, consumer insights, 
sustainability, marketing, accounting, auditing and risk 
management are taken particularly into account as 
candidates for the post of Director. International 
experience and team leadership in multinationals will be 
valued.
Additionally, and in order to comply with the 
recommendation of the Good Governance Code of 
Listed Companies and also with the Comisión Nacional 
del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) Technical Guide on 
Nomination and Appointment Committees and the 
Technical Guide on Audit Committees at Public-Interest 
Entities, Telefónica offers all the members of the Board 
of Directors continuous training and refresher programs 
on those aspects that are particularly important to the 
performance of their duties.
Specifically, in recent years, training and information 
sessions have been imparted to the members of the 
Board of Directors and the Board Committees by 
external consultants and internal teams, with a particular 
focus on areas related to Sustainability and including 
diversity and inclusion, the European taxonomy, climate 
change, ESG-related regulatory aspects and 
benchmarks, cybersecurity and technological risks, 
Artificial Intelligence and the Telefónica Group's Risk 
Management Model.
The Company also has a process in place for the 
onboarding of new Directors, who are provided with an 
induction pack containing relevant information about 
the Company, in order to offer the necessary support to 
new members of the Board of Directors or its 
Committees. This enables them to quickly gain a 
thorough understanding of the Company and its Group, 
so that they can actively perform their duties as soon as 
they are appointed. Each year, the Directors also receive 
the Company’s Code of Ethics (Responsible Business 
Principles).
GOV-1_17
In short, the current structure and composition of the 
Company's Board of Directors and its Committees 
maintains an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge 
and experience, among others, in sustainability.
In this regard, it should be noted that the current skills 
and knowledge possessed overall by the Company’s 
Board of Directors contribute to a multi-faceted vision. 
This makes it possible to facilitate the identification of 
impacts, risks and opportunities and, as a result, the 
achievement of the corporate targets.
2.4.3. Information provided to the 
Company’s administrative, 
management and supervisory bodies 
addressing sustainability matters
2.4.3.1. Areas entrusted with reporting to 
the Board of Directors and to the Board’s 
Committees on sustainability matters
GOV-2_01
With regard to sustainability issues, the Global 
Sustainability (ESG) Office is the area responsible for 
reporting on a monthly basis to the Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee and, when appropriate, to the 
Audit and Control Committee and the Company's Board 
of Directors. It is also the area responsible for monitoring 
and coordinating sustainability issues, which include, 
among others, the sustainability strategy (Responsible 
Business Plan, which details actions, monitoring metrics 
and objectives), double materiality analysis, sustainable 
governance and culture, the environment, human rights, 
due diligence in the value chain, customer responsibility 
and sustainable interaction with other stakeholders such 
as analysts or investors.
In addition, other areas of the Company manage or 
support functions related to sustainability and can also 
report, together with the Global Sustainability (ESG) 
Office, to the Sustainability and Regulation Committee. 
These areas include, at least, those under Corporate 
Affairs and Sustainability, Finance and Control, General 
Secretary and Regulation, Strategy and Development, 
People and Technology and Information.
2.4.3.2. How the Board of Directors and the 
Board Committees consider impacts, risks 
and opportunities in their supervisory and 
decision-making role
GOV-2_02, GOV-2_03
The way that the Board of Directors and the Board 
Committees consider impacts, risks and opportunities is 
essential in order to supervise the Company’s strategy.
In this respect, the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee, as an informational and advisory Committee

of the Board of Directors, supervises and reviews the 
strategies and policies of the Company’s Responsible 
Business Plan, which includes environmental and social 
subjects, ensuring that they meet stakeholder 
expectations and deliver on value creation, and 
proposes to the Board of Directors that they be updated 
and modified where necessary.
Likewise, the Sustainability and Regulation Committee 
supervises the impact analyses linked to the Responsible 
Business strategy and reputation. This Committee also 
analyses, promotes and supervises the Telefónica 
Group’s sustainability targets, action plans and 
practices, including aspects such as ethical behaviour, 
human rights, the environment and climate change, 
responsible management of the supply chain, digital 
trust and the responsible use of technology, talent and 
diversity, responsibility towards customers, ethical and 
sustainable products and services, and inclusive 
connectivity, as well as other issues identified as risks or 
opportunities in terms of sustainability.
Additionally, the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee reports to the Audit and Control Committee 
on sustainability risks, among other duties.
Over the course of the meetings held in 2024, the 
Sustainability and Regulation Committee assessed, 
among other aspects, the major sustainability issues, 
including the implementation of the Responsible 
Business Plan.
During this period, the Company identified the list of 
impacts, risks and opportunities of the Telefónica Group, 
which is described in this report in 2.3. Double 
Materiality.
In this respect, in 2024, the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee analysed the double materiality process 
conducted internally, which has also been reported to 
the Audit and Control Committee, enabling it to identify 
which standards and sustainability matters (topics, sub-
topics and sub-subtopics) are material for Telefónica 
and which must be taken into account in sustainability 
information reporting. Additionally, the aforementioned 
Committees were informed in detail of the list of topics, 
sub-topics and sub-subtopics that were examined to 
identify and assess the impacts, risks and opportunities 
for the Telefónica Group.
It must be noted that some members of the 
Sustainability and Regulation Committee are also 
members of the Audit and Control Committee. The 
presence of some Directors on both Committees and 
the reporting by the Chairman of the Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee, Mr. Francisco Javier de Paz 
Mancho, at the Board of Directors’ meetings about the 
main issues dealt with at the respective sessions, 
ensures that the most significant sustainability matters 
are taken into account in the deliberations of the Board 
of Directors, therefore enabling better identification of 
the impacts, risks and opportunities associated with 
those matters.
2.4.4. Integration of sustainability-
related performance into incentive 
schemes
GOV-3_01, GOV-3_04
The design of the variable remuneration, which seeks to 
encourage attainment of the Company’s short- and 
long-term targets, is in line with its strategy through:
• Operating Revenues objective for short-term variable 
remuneration and the commitment of long-term value 
creation for shareholders contained in the TSR metric 
for long-term variable remuneration. In addition to the 
above, customer trust, measured through the NPS, is 
taken into account.
• EBITDA objective for short-term variable remuneration 
and CO2 emissions reduction targets.
• Sustainability, both in the financial dimension and from 
the ESG perspective:
– Financial: growth in generation of Free Cash Flow 
included for both short-term and long-term variable 
remuneration.
– ESG: through the target percentage of female 
managers. In this regard, it has been included in 
long-term and short-term variable remuneration.
Regarding executives’ short-term variable remuneration, 
20% is linked to sustainability objectives, all of which are 
predetermined, specific and quantifiable, and set and 
strictly assessed by the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee, which also monitors 
the objectives to ensure their alignment with 
Telefónica's corporate interests.
GOV-3_02
The variable remuneration of Telefónica’s executives is 
comprised of:
• A short-term incentive, which aims to reward the 
achievement of a combination of financial, business-
based operative objectives and ESG objectives that 
are predetermined, specific and quantifiable and 
aligned with Telefónica’s strategic targets.
The metrics linked to short-term variable remuneration 
are outlined below:

executives commitment to the Company and its 
strategy, linking their remuneration to value creation 
for shareholders as well as the sustainable 
achievement of strategic objectives, so that it is 
aligned with best practices in terms of remuneration.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by the General 
Shareholders' Meeting in 2024 (See Note 27 of the 2024 
Consolidated Financial Statements), has a total duration 
of five years and is divided into three cycles (each one 
being independent of the others), each with a duration 
of three years (First Cycle 2024-2026, Second Cycle 
2025-2027 and Third Cycle 2026-2028).

Short-term variable remuneration is 20% made up 
of metrics linked to sustainability objectives, which 
are explained below:
• Customer trust - 10%
NPS is the metric used to measure customer 
satisfaction and experience and the likelihood that 
they would recommend products and services. It is 
constructed from the question included in customer 
surveys “How likely would you be to recommend 
Movistar/O2/Vivo services to a family member, friend 
or colleague? (On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means you 
would not recommend and 10 means you would 
recommend)”. Those rating 9 and 10 are considered 
promoters, and those rating 1 to 6 are considered 
detractors.
NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors.

Consolidated Annual Report 2024
Telefónica, S. A.

The Group's Global NPS is calculated based on the 
results obtained in Spain, Germany, Brazil and Hispam 
operations.
• Climate change – 5%:
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is the metric used 
to measure environmental impact. It is measured 
through direct and indirect CO2 emissions from 
Telefónica’s daily activity. CO2 emission = Activity Data 
x Emission Factor:
– Activity data: the amount of energy, fuel, gas, etc., 
consumed by the Group.
– Emission Factor: the amount of CO2 emitted into the 
atmosphere by the consumption of each activity 
unit.
For electricity, the emission factors included in the IEA 
Emission Factors (2024) report of the International 
Energy Agency and local official sources (ministries of 
energy or environment) of each country are used. For 
fuels, emission factors from the GHG Protocol, IPCC 
(UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and 
carbon footprint reporting tools provided by the 
ministries of the different countries are used. Constant 
emission factors are used for the annual remuneration 
in order to avoid variations due to causes beyond the 
Company's control.
• Gender equality – 5%:
The percentage of women executives at the 
Telefónica Group is the metric used to measure the 
target related to gender equality. It is measured based 
on the total number of Telefónica Group executives in 
the workforce at the end of December. The group of 
executives is defined according to the criteria and 
processes determined by the People area. Prior to 
validation by the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee, proposals for 
appointments to this group are validated, on a monthly 
basis, by a Transparency and Diversity Committee 
made up of the Chairman and four Executive 
Committee members, to contribute to compliance 
with the transparency and gender equality measures 
and policies established.
Long-term variable remuneration is 10% made up 
of metrics linked to sustainability objectives, 
which are explained below:
• Climate change – 5%:
Following the same line as in the short term, but for 
this part of the incentive to be paid, it is additionally 
necessary to achieve a minimum levels of Scope 1 + 2 
emissions reductions, in line with the 1.5ºC scenario of 
the Paris Agreement (SBTi). This is all aimed at 
achieving net zero emissions by 2040 and supporting 
activities that mitigate climate change in an amount 
equivalent to the Scope 1 + 2 emissions of its main 
markets from 2025 onwards. 
In accordance with Telefónica's Climate Action Plan 
and SBTi recommendations, carbon credits from 
reduced emissions from deforestation and 
degradation will also be eligible. This information is 
verified annually by an external verifier.
• Gender equality – 5%:
The percentage of women executives at the 
Telefónica Group is the metric used to measure the 
target related to gender equality. It is measured based 
on the total number of Telefónica Group executives in 
the workforce at the end of December, maintaining 
the same criteria and processes used for short-term 
variable remuneration.
GOV-3_06
The design of the variable remuneration within the 
Remuneration Policy as well as the setting of the targets, 
their assessment, auditing and payment, are subject to a 
strict governance system, with payment also subject to 
Malus and Clawback clauses.
The General Shareholders' Meeting approves Telefónica’s 
Remuneration Policy, which contains the main 
characteristics of the variable remuneration of the 
executives at the Company, at least every three years as a 
separate item on the agenda.
The Board of Directors approves the design, target 
amounts, degree of achievement of the objectives and 
amounts of the incentive to be accrued, where appropriate, 
for short-term variable remuneration and long-term variable 
remuneration, based on a proposal from the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee.
The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee proposes the objectives to the 
Board of Directors at the start of each measurement period 
and assesses the achievement of the objectives after the 
measurement period has ended. In view of the fact that the 
accrual of variable remuneration is subject to sufficient 
verification that the established objectives have been 
effectively fulfilled, as established in recommendation 59 of 
the Good Governance Code, the assessment is performed 
on the basis of the results audited by the external auditor 
and the internal auditor at the Company, which are 
analysed, firstly, by the Audit and Control Committee, as 
well as the degree to which the objectives have been 
achieved.
2.4.5. Internal control over 
sustainability reporting
GOV-5_01
The Telefónica Group has an internal control model that 
is defined in line with the Internal Control—Integrated 
Framework of the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

The Group's use of this framework facilitates the 
recognition and validity of the Company’s Internal 
Control system vis-à-vis third parties, such as external 
verifiers or supervisory bodies. In accordance with the 
applicable corporate governance frameworks, internal 
control takes into account both financial and non-
financial aspects, including operational, technological, 
legal, social, environmental, reputational and regulatory 
compliance aspects.
In accordance with COSO's integrated framework, the 
key components of the Internal Control system are 
essential to ensuring it operates efficiently, effectively 
and in accordance with current regulations. These 
components are the following:
• Control environment.
• Risk assessment.
• Control activities.
• Information and communication.
• Monitoring activities.
GOV-5_02, GOV-5_03
Telefónica has a Risk Management Model, based on the 
2017 COSO ERM framework guidance (Enterprise Risk 
Management—Integrating with Strategy and 
Performance), which is implemented consistently 
throughout the Group’s main operations. The Company 
also has a Risk Management Policy, approved by the 
Board of Directors, and a Risk Management Procedure, 
which provides a common methodology for identifying, 
assessing and reporting risks consistently and effectively 
within the Telefónica Group.
This model considers a risk assessment through two 
complementary perspectives: top-down (based on a 
cross-cutting analysis of those matters considered 
material and common to most of the Group's 
companies) and bottom-up (based on risk self-
assessment by managers).
Specifically, in relation to the risks that are directly 
related to the reporting of sustainability information, 
work is being done to develop a map of specific risks in 
this area, which is expected to be completed in 2025.
It is also important to highlight that since 2019 the 
Company has assessed, managed and monitored the 
risk of “Adaptation to ESG reporting requirements”, 
defined as being the risk associated with the increased 
reporting requirements requested by regulators, 
analysts, investors, customers and other stakeholders 
from the Telefónica Group's various entities in ESG 
matters.
GOV-5_04, GOV-5_05
In accordance with the Internal Control Policy and the 
Regulations on the Recording, Reporting and Control of 
Financial and Sustainability Information, the 
management areas are responsible for the internal 
control structures associated with the information they 
generate.
In addition, the Internal Audit area assesses and 
supervises internal control associated with sustainability 
reporting in accordance with the Telefónica Group’s 
Internal Audit Plan submitted to the Audit and Control 
Committee, and it issues its conclusions to the 
management areas responsible for the processes.
These conclusions are reflected in reports that describe 
the findings, internal control recommendations and 
remediation plans, which are escalated, where 
appropriate, to the Board of Directors (the body 
ultimately responsible for the reporting), through the 
Audit and Control Committee.

2.5. Due diligence
GOV-4_01
Telefónica has a due diligence process in place to 
identify, prevent and remedy potential or actual adverse 
impacts on people and the environment throughout the 
value chain. This process is based on the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, as well as other 
international agreements and regulations on human 
rights.
In line with Directive (EU) 2024/1760 on corporate 
sustainability due diligence, the six key elements 
(phases) of the due diligence process are as follows, 
with the involvement of affected stakeholders as a 
cross-cutting element:
1. Integrate due diligence into policies and 
management systems.
2. Identify and assess adverse impacts.
3. Prevent, mitigate and neutralise adverse impacts.
4. Monitor and assess the effectiveness of measures.
5. Communicate.
6. Remedy.
1. Integration of due diligence into policies and 
risk management systems 
Telefónica's commitment to respecting and promoting 
human rights is embodied through the internal policies 
and procedures that make up its due diligence process, 
which takes into account the entire value chain. 
To be more precise, the starting point of the due 
diligence process is the Global Human Rights Policy. 
This policy is based on the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises, as well as other 
international human rights conventions and 
commitments. The policy is approved by the Board of 
Directors and applies to all companies within the Group. 
It demonstrates a commitment to human rights and 
establishes the general guiding principles that are the 
base of the Company's relationship with employees, 
suppliers and their workers, consumers and society in 
general.
The governance model is as follows:
• Board of Directors: responsible for approving the 
Responsible Business Plan, which includes the human 
rights and environmental due diligence process.
• Sustainability and Regulation Committee: oversees the 
implementation of the Responsible Business Plan and, 
therefore, the due diligence process. 
• Audit and Control Committee: responsible for 
overseeing the risk management model - which, 
among other risks, includes those related to human 
rights - and the effectiveness of internal control, as 
well as the integrity of related information. 
• Global Sustainability Department (ESG): responsible 
for developing, coordinating and monitoring the 
Responsible Business Plan. 
• Management Areas: implement the general due 
diligence process (Global Sustainability Department, 
Human Resources, Procurement, General Council, 
Compliance and any other area that may be relevant 
depending on the subject matter). 
• Local teams: involved in monitoring, target setting and 
continuous improvement at local level.
2. Identification and assessment of actual and 
potential adverse impacts
The development of Telefónica’s activities may have 
adverse impacts on human rights and the environment. 
For this reason and as part of the due diligence process, 
there is an impact assessment procedure in place that 
allows the Company to regularly identify and assess 
potential and actual impacts. This procedure involves 
two kinds of assessments:

1.  Global impact assessment
Purpose
Identify the most significant human rights and 
environmental issues/impacts.
i
2. Impact assessments for all operations
Purpose
Analyse whether the most significant issues/
impacts identified in the global impact 
assessment materialise in the Company’s 
operations (every six months).
• Global impact assessments: the aim is to identify and 
assess potential impacts that Telefónica may cause in 
order to prevent and manage them. These 
assessments are carried out periodically at a global 
level by an independent external expert and with the 
participation of internal and external stakeholders 
through interviews. 
• Impact assessments for all operations of Telefónica: 
The company periodically conducts assessments of all 
its business operators to analyse whether the impacts 
identified at a global level materialise locally.
3. Prevention, mitigation and neutralisation of 
adverse impacts
Action plans are established and management measures 
implemented to prevent and mitigate potential adverse 
impacts on human rights. 
Below is a summary of the most notable projects and 
initiatives designed to prevent, mitigate and neutralise 
adverse impacts:
• Mandatory training on human rights for all employees 
through the Responsible Business Principles and 
Human Rights Course.
• Due diligence in the supply chain: Telefónica has a 
supplier management process to identify potential 
adverse impacts in its supply chain and manage them. 
This process is covered in detail in ESRS G1 - Business 
Conduct, in the following section:
 2.14.5. Suppliers 
• Implementation of human rights by design: product 
managers conduct a self-assessment of new products 
and services through an online tool during the design 
phase to identify and address potential impacts on 
human rights, among other areas. 
• Adoption of new policies and updating of existing 
policies related to human rights: for example, the 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) Governance Model 
Regulations.
4. Monitoring and assessment of the 
effectiveness of the adopted measures 
Telefónica works to ensure the effectiveness of the 
measures adopted to prevent, mitigate and remedy 
human rights and environmental impacts. 
To this end, the Company defines and monitors 
qualitative and quantitative indicators, which are 
included in the Responsible Business Plan. 
Implementation of the Plan is annually reported to the 
Board of Directors through the Sustainability and 
Regulatory Committee. 
In addition, operators at local level report on basic 
human rights risks every six months.
5. Communication and accessibility of 
information  
In addition to the information in this Report, Telefónica 
prepares a report on the due diligence process for 
human rights and the environment. This report, available 
on the corporate website, outlines key impact areas and 
incorporates the latest Global Impact Assessment, the 
due diligence process and examples of best practices. 
Updated information on human rights and 
environmental management is also available on the 
corporate website. 
6. Remediation of adverse impacts
The Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and the 
Whistleblowing Channel are the mechanisms available 
for raising queries related to the Company's code of 
ethics and conduct and reporting any irregularity or act 
in breach of the law or internal regulations, respectively.
These channels allow stakeholders to inform the 
Company of any issues related to actual or potential 
adverse impacts on human rights and the environment 
that may arise in Telefónica's own operations and 
throughout the value chain.  
They are available to all stakeholders 24/7 through 
institutional and commercial channels. They are 
available in multiple languages and support anonymous 
reporting, if desired.  
These channels are managed in accordance with the 
internal procedures established in Queries Channel 
Management Regulations and Telefónica’s Internal 
Information System Management Policy, respectively. 
This information is covered in the following section of 
the Report:
 2.14.3.2. Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and 
Whistleblowing Channel

2.8. European Taxonomy for 
sustainable activities
2.8.1. Regulatory requirements 
As part of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable 
Growth and the European Union’s Green Deal, the 
Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 lays the 
foundation for a classification system that allows an 
economic activity to be recognised as sustainable. It 
aims to redirect capital flows to achieve a more 
competitive, circular and climate-neutral economy by 
2050.
According to the Regulation, Telefónica must disclose 
information on the eligible and aligned proportion of its 
turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating 
expenses (OpEx) related to environmentally sustainable 
economic activities. Below is a description of the 
process used for calculating the key performance 
indicators (KPIs), which also covers key aspects related 
to accounting policy, compliance with Regulation (EU) 
2020/852 and contextual information to support an 
adequate understanding of the results. 
The focus of the analysis has been determined based on 
the provisions of the Delegated Regulations, which 
develop and complement the Regulation, and their 
corresponding annexes. 
In 2024, as a novelty, the eligibility and alignment of all 
activities for each of the environmental objectives must 
be considered. In the case of Telefónica, the alignment 
of activities 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of 
renewable energy technologies and 5.5. Product-as-a-
service and other circular use- and result-oriented 
service models have been included for the first time.
2.8.2. Identified activities
Economic activities within the EU Taxonomy 
Telefónica has identified, according to the Taxonomy, 
the following activities as taxonomy-eligible. 
• Activities that can make a substantial contribution to 
climate change mitigation (CCM, according to the 
terminology in the Regulation): 
◦Activity 8.1. Data processing, hosting and related 
activities.
◦Activity 8.2. Data-driven solutions for GHG 
emissions reductions.
◦Activity 7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of 
renewable energy technologies. 
• Activities that can make a substantial contribution to 
the transition to a circular economy (CE, according to 
the terminology in the Regulation):
◦Activity 5.1. Repair, refurbishment and 
remanufacturing.
◦Activity 5.4. Sale of second-hand goods.
◦Activity 5.5. Product-as-a-service and other 
circular use- and result-oriented service models.
Investments in activities that help to mitigate and 
minimise the Company's environmental impact have also 
been identified. These activities are mainly related to 
energy efficiency and sustainable mobility.
They are:
• Activity 6.5. Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles.
• Activity 7.3. Installation, maintenance and repair of 
energy efficiency equipment (individual measure).
• Activity 7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of 
charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings 
(individual measure).
• Activity 7.5. Installation, maintenance and repair of 
instruments and devices for measuring, regulating and 
controlling energy performance of buildings (individual 
measure).
• Activity 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings.
In relation to the activities recognised as individual 
measures under the Taxonomy Regulation (activities 
7.3., 7.4. and 7.5.), their potential alignment is not 
representative in the global context of the Company. As 
a result, they are not included in the scope of the report. 
For the same reasons, analyses of compliance with 
technical criteria or do no significant harm (DNSH) have 
not been carried out for these activities.

2.8.3. Calculation of KPIs
2.8.3.1. Scope and general considerations
Scope of the report
The Regulation applies to the activities carried out by 
Telefónica in the companies within its scope of 
consolidation (see Scope of consolidation in section 2.1). 
In order to calculate the KPIs, Telefónica has taken into 
account information at source from the local and/or 
global databases for the different business units. 
Transactions between Group companies have been 
analysed for identification and traceability purposes. 
However, they are not included in the calculation as they 
are eliminated in the consolidation process.
Accounting policy
Throughout the entire process, due care was taken to 
avoid double counting: 
• Reconciliation with the accounting information, which 
ensures that eliminations and adjustments made 
during the consolidation process are properly taken 
into account. 
• Use of consistent information sources, which prevents  
the same item being considered in two different KPIs 
or twice in the same KPI. 
• Verification of the completeness and accuracy of the 
data. 
2.8.3.2. Turnover
The denominator of this indicator corresponds to the 
Group's consolidated Revenues, which in the year 2024 
amounts to 41,315 million euros (see Note 26 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements).
Revenues have been classified, in accordance with their 
nomenclature and codes in the tables, under the 
following headings: 
• A.1. Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned 
activities (1,266 million euros): digital services/
solutions aimed at providing data and analysis to 
reduce GHG emissions from other activities (782 
million euros) (CCM 8.2.); the proportion 
corresponding to the rental of equipment necessary 
for the provision of connectivity, television and mobile 
handset-renting services that meets the technical 
screening criteria  (468 million euros) (CE 5.5.); the 
installation and maintenance of solar panels (16 million 
euros) (CCM 7.6.). 
• A.2. Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxonomy-aligned 
activities (1,313 million euros): cloud services made 
available to users, facilitating data storage in data 
centres (946 million euros) (CCM 8.1.); the 
maintenance and repair of customer equipment (7 
million euros) (CE 5.1.); the sale of second-hand mobile 
handsets (46 million euros) (CE 5.4.); as well as the 
proportion corresponding to the rental of equipment 
necessary for the provision of connectivity, television 
and mobile handset-renting services that does not 
meet the technical screening criteria (314 million 
euros) (CE 5.5.). 
• B. Taxonomy-non-eligible activities (38,735 
million euros): connectivity data, voice and television 
services; the sale of new handsets; and other digital 
services/solutions than those defined in the 
Taxonomy.
Turnover information is shown below in accordance with 
the template of Annex V of Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2023/2486.

2.8.3.3. Capital expenditure (CapEx)
The CapEx indicator in the Taxonomy Regulation is 
defined in broader terms than the traditional concept 
associated with fixed asset investments. 
The denominator includes additions to property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets (equal to CapEx as 
defined in the financial information reported by the 
Group). It also includes additions of right-of-use assets 
recognised in accordance with IFRS 16, as well as 
additions of property, plant and equipment, intangible 
assets and right-of-use assets arising from business 
combinations. 
The details of the calculation for the years 2024 and 
2023 are as follows:

2.8.4. Compliance with the technical 
screening criteria
For each of the activities identified as eligible, the 
substantial contribution and do no significant harm 
criteria must be assessed. In addition, the Group's 
compliance with the social minimum safeguards must be 
verified.
The main actions carried out by Telefónica to assess the 
alignment of the eligible activities are detailed below, 
except for Activities 6.5. Transport by motorbikes, 
passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and 7.7. 
Acquisition and ownership of buildings.
Regarding the rest of the activities, the Company is 
analysing methodologies to carry out the corresponding 
evaluation and determine its alignment.
2.8.4.1. Substantial contribution to climate 
change mitigation
8.2. Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions 
reductions 
To address the technical screening criteria, the services 
were grouped into solutions such as teleworking, smart 
mobility solutions, or e-health solutions, among others.
The substantial contribution of data-driven solutions 
depends on the fulfilment of two technical screening 
criteria.
First, the ICT solutions must be predominantly used to 
provide data and analytics enabling GHG emissions 
reductions.
There are many sectoral studies and methodologies, 
both internal and third-party, that evaluate, identify and, 
in some cases, quantify the climate impacts and 
emissions reductions associated with the use of digital 
solutions (e.g. GSMA’s The Abatement Effect and the 
GeSI Mobile Carbon Impact report).
In addition, Telefónica carries out projects and 
methodologies to evaluate the impact of its solutions 
such as life cycle assessment of some solutions, 
calculating emissions avoided based on internationally 
recognized standards or the Eco Smart seal to identify 
products and services with environmental benefits.  
The substantial contribution of energy efficiency and 
virtualisation solutions applied to the 
telecommunications network has also been analysed 
and demonstrated.
The second technical criterion, which is related to life 
cycle analysis, is not considered applicable to the 
categories of solutions described above, as there are no 
alternative solutions on the market.
7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of 
renewable energy technologies
This activity involves the installation of solar panels in 
homes and businesses and is consistent with the 
individual measures that have been determined to 
ensure a substantial contribution to climate change 
mitigation.
2.8.4.2. Substantial contribution to the 
transition to a circular economy  
5.5. Product-as-a-service and other circular 
models
For the substantial contribution analysis, Telefónica has 
taken into account B2C equipment associated with the 
services included in this taxonomy activity.
From the contractual perspective, it has been 
determined that the conditions of the contracts 
guarantee: that Telefónica remains the owner of the 
device; that a payment is made for access to the service, 
requiring the device to be provided under a renting or 
similar arrangement; and that there is an obligation to 
return/collect the equipment at the end of the contract.
Another technical aspect for evaluating and determining 
compliance with this technical criterion relates to the 
composition and design of the packaging for the 
devices. In this regard, Telefónica has analysed the 
technical specifications of the packaging used as part of 
the service provision so as to evaluate aspects related to 
the use of recycled materials and the sustainable 
management of raw materials utilised, as well as the 
design for reuse of the packaging.
Only the proportional share of KPIs that meets the 
aforementioned points is taken into account. 
2.8.4.3. Do No Significant Harm to other 
activities
Climate change mitigation
The analysis has shown that the activity is carried out 
based on a strategy of accounting for and reducing GHG 
emissions in the context of Telefónica’s corporate 
decarbonisation targets.
Climate change adaptation
As a new development this year, Telefónica's climate risk 
analysis also takes into account activities contributing to 
the circular economy objective, which are those related 
to equipment refurbishment (5.1.), the sale of second-
hand devices (5.4.) and the logistics of equipment leased 
to customers and businesses (5.5.). Regarding the 
activity of solar panel installation (7.6.), no material 
physical climate risks have been identified. 
To this end, Telefónica assessed the physical risk of 
climate change using the most up-to-date climate

projections (AR6), covering both SSP1-2.6 (global 
temperature increase by the end of the century of no 
more than 2ºC) and SSP5-8.5 (global temperature 
increase by the end of the century of around 4ºC) 
climate scenarios and time horizons up to 2030, 2040 
and 2050. 
Accordingly, Telefónica has updated its adaptation plan 
to further strengthen adaptation to the effects of climate 
change and reduce exposure to identified physical risks.  
Sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine resources
Telefónica's water consumption mainly comes from 
sanitary use and to a lesser extent from cooling. The 
cooling systems at data centres are closed loop systems. 
Therefore, there are no discharges into freshwater or 
marine waterways that could cause significant harm.
Transition to a circular economy
With regard to the management of waste at the end of 
the useful life of electrical and electronic equipment, 
Telefónica has entered into contractual agreements for 
the collection of waste and verifies that the waste 
management company is authorised and monitors the 
waste appropriately. In addition, the appropriate 
documentation is in place to ensure compliance with the 
directives applicable to the equipment purchased that 
forms part of the Company's operations.
Pollution prevention and control
Telefónica has assessed the following aspects through 
confirmation by suppliers of electrical and electronic 
equipment of the Company's environmental 
declarations:
• In line with the provisions of the REACH Regulation, 
the supplier declares that the products it supplies to 
Telefónica do not exceed 0.1% by weight of the 
substances described. Otherwise, there is no 
alternative with a complete absence of any of these 
substances. Furthermore, the absence of products 
with added mercury has been verified.
• In line with the provisions of the RoHS directive, the 
supplier declares that the products it supplies to 
Telefónica do not exceed the limits established in 
Annex II.
2.8.4.4. Social minimum safeguards
For an economic activity to qualify as environmentally 
sustainable, it must be carried out in accordance with 
the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights. The assessment of Telefónica’s compliance also 
takes into account the Platform on Sustainable 
Finance’s Report on Minimum Safeguards published in 
October 2022. 
Telefónica respects and promotes human rights 
throughout its entire value chain. For this reason, it has a 
due diligence system in place that includes policies, 
regular adverse impact assessment procedures, 
management measures to prevent and mitigate 
identified potential impacts, monitoring and 
communication procedures, and complaint and remedy 
mechanisms. It also has policies and procedures in place 
regarding, inter alia, competition, anti-corruption, 
responsible business, conflicts of interest and fiscal 
responsibility, in order to reinforce the Group's 
commitment to social rights and sustainable growth. 
2.8.5. Other information related to 
the Taxonomy
2.8.5.1. Telecommunications networks in the 
Taxonomy
The application of the Taxonomy's regulatory framework 
has generated uncertainty and doubt about its 
interpretation in the market. In the ICT sector, the main 
issue has centred around activity 8.2. and whether or not 
telecommunications networks are included within its 
scope.
In November 2024, Connect Europe (formerly ETNO) 
together with GSMA, Nokia, Ericsson and ECTA,  
published the sectoral Position Paper Unlocking 
sustainable finance to achieve Europe´s Digital Decade 
targets highlighting the importance of including 
telecommunications networks as a new activity in the 
upcoming revision of the Taxonomy Climate Delegated 
Act. Telefónica has actively participated in this initiative 
alongside the sector.
The conclusions of the EU Council on the White Paper 
"How to master Europe’s digital infrastructure needs?" 
acknowledge that widening the scope of the EU 
Taxonomy for green investments in electronic 
communications networks can create incentives to 
attract the investments necessary to roll out more 
environmentally sustainable networks.
In line with this evolution, in January 2025, the EU 
Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) published a draft 
report on activities and technical screening criteria to be 
updated or included in the EU Taxonomy. This report 
lists telecommunications networks as a new activity 
within the European Commission’s mandate.
These developments reflect the growing recognition of 
the strategic role that telecommunications networks 
play in Europe’s digital and green transition, as well as 
the need for a regulatory framework that facilitates 
investment in sustainable digital infrastructure.

2.9.1. Governance
Telefónica integrates climate change and sustainability 
issues into its organisational culture through several 
lines of action: allocating responsibilities within its 
governance structure, developing policies and aligning 
ESG targets with employees’ variable incentives.
The climate change and energy strategy is part of the 
Company’s Responsible Business Plan, which is 
approved by the Board of Directors. The Sustainability 
and Regulation Committee, the Audit and Control 
Committee and the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee, in accordance with 
the duties specified in their respective rules of 
procedure, supervise its implementation and related 
risks, and monitor the targets.
E1.GOV-3_01
Variable remuneration linked to climate 
considerations
The design of the variable remuneration is set out in the 
Remuneration Policy of the Directors of Telefónica S.A. 
The policy is approved by the General Shareholders' 
Meeting of the Company at least every three years as a 
separate item on the agenda, following approval by the 
Board of Directors of the proposal made by the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee.
The variable remuneration seeks to encourage the 
attainment of the Company’s short- and long-term 
targets.
Therefore, a percentage of employees' variable 
remuneration is linked to objectives related to climate 
change and reductions in Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions. These objectives are 
predetermined, specific, quantifiable and material. They 
are put forward by the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee and set and 
assessed by the Board of Directors, which also monitors 
them to verify that they are aligned with Telefónica’s 
interests.
The short-term variable remuneration scheme is 
applicable to all Group employees, including executive 
directors and executives, while the long-term incentive 
plan applies only to the executive directors and other 
executives.
E1.GOV-3_02
For each plan, for both the Short-Term Incentive and the 
Long-Term Incentive, a variable compensation 
percentage of 5% has been defined, which is associated 
with the following climate-related considerations:
 E1.GOV-3_03
Short-term variable remuneration is directly linked to 
annual reductions in absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions (tCO2e). This annual reduction target is in line 
with the Company's reduction targets for these Scopes 
(see section 2.9.4. Metrics and targets).
For the purpose of calculating the payment coefficient 
corresponding to each level of achievement of an annual 
objective, Telefónica has determined a performance 
scale that includes a minimum threshold below which no 
incentive is accrued. In the case of 100% achievement of 
a predetermined objective, the target amount of the 
short-term variable remuneration will be paid. In the 
case of maximum achievement of the objectives, the 
maximum amount of the short-term variable 
remuneration will be paid.

Long-term variable remuneration is linked to the level of 
neutralisation/offsetting of the Telefónica Group’s 
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, with payment of this part of 
the incentive additionally dependent on a minimum level 
of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions reductions being achieved. 
In the definition of the metric, neutralisation/offsetting is 
defined as the purchase of carbon credits to absorb or 
reduce CO2 emissions from the atmosphere.
Based on a proposal made by the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, 
the Board of Directors has determined a performance 
scale that includes a minimum threshold of 90% 
achievement below which no incentive will be accrued. 
The fulfilment of the 90% threshold will result in 2.5% of 
the theoretical shares granted being delivered, and a 
maximum level of 100% achievement will result in 5% of 
the theoretical shares granted being delivered.

2.9.2. Strategy
E1-1_01
Telefónica’s Climate Action Plan (CAP) defines the 
Company's transition plan for mitigating and adapting to 
climate change, sets forth the energy and climate 
change strategy and shows how it is integrated 
throughout the Company.
The Company’s strategy and business model are aligned 
with scientific climate recommendations, so both are 
compatible with the transition to a low-carbon economy 
and the 1.5ºC scenario of the Paris Agreement1. 
E1-1_14
The CAP is approved on an annual basis by the Board of 
Directors, following analysis by the Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee. Telefónica’s Energy and Climate 
Change Office, together with the different areas of the 
Group that are involved in the development of actions 
aimed at achieving the emissions reduction targets, keep 
the plan updated and report any substantial modification 
to the Sustainability and Regulation Committee and/or 
to the Board of Directors in advance.
E1-1_02
Integrated into Telefónica's governance model, the CAP  
includes both the emissions of the current year and 
historical emissions, as well as emissions reduction 
targets. Telefónica’s ambition is to achieve net zero 
emissions by 2040 at a global level, of Scopes 1, 2 and 3 
emissions, including emissions associated with its value 
chain. In addition to this long-term target, Telefónica’s 
decarbonisation plan includes short- and medium-term 
targets, which are described in more detail in section 
2.9.4. Metrics and targets. These targets are validated by 
the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)2.
Specifically, the compatibility of the targets with the 
1.5ºC limit is described in the Science-based targets 
section. 
Decarbonisation levers and adaptation and 
mitigation actions
E1-1_03
The Climate Action Plan is Telefónica’s roadmap to 
reach net zero emissions by 2040. It takes the 
identification of climate-related risks and opportunities 
as its starting point, and defines the key decarbonisation 
levers and specific mitigation and adaptation actions for 
achieving the Company's climate targets.
The CAP intends, among its objectives, to optimise 
Telefónica's internal processes in order to reduce 
operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). To this end, the 
Company has in place an Energy Efficiency Plan, which 
aims to reduce energy consumption, and a Renewable 
Energy Plan, which focuses on increasing the use of 
renewable energy as opposed to fossil sources.

1 The Paris Agreement aims to keep the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C and preferably to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. 
2 To validate targets, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) requires that companies' targets are science-based, i.e. consistent with the level of 
decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature increase to 1.5ºC. To this end, they define the overall emissions reductions that a company must 
achieve to align with global net zero. Specifically, in the cross-sectoral pathway, the science-based long-term targets are equivalent to an absolute reduction of 
at least 90% of a company's total GHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) compared to the base year.

For value chain emissions (Scope 3), the CAP defines 
and fosters cooperative action with suppliers. 
Furthermore, integrating circularity criteria at the 
Company, such as the refurbishment and reuse of fixed 
customer equipment or the consideration of 
environmental criteria in procurement processes, 
extends the lifespans of equipment and avoids emissions 
associated with the extraction of the materials needed 
to manufacture new devices.
For further information about decarbonisation levers, 
please refer to section 2.9.3.2. Action plans, which details 
Telefónica’s adaptation and mitigation measures.
In addition to the decarbonisation levers, the CAP 
includes commercial actions, describing how Telefónica 
helps its B2B and B2C customers avoid generating GHG 
emissions, due to connectivity and the use of digital 
solutions (these emissions do not contribute to reducing 
the Telefónica Group's carbon footprint). It also 
incorporates economic considerations, including the 
sustainable financing model and the internalisation of 
carbon pricing mechanism as a decision-making driver.
E1-1_15
In addition to defining the emissions reduction targets, 
the Company's climate strategy incorporates specific 
KPIs that demonstrate Telefónica’s performance against 
the planned targets and how the Group is working to 
achieve them within the timeframe set.
Furthermore, if any of the initial targets have already 
been reached, Telefónica considers modifying them or  
redefining one or more of the associated targets. 
E1-1_07
Both the assets of the Telefónica Group and the 
products it sells are mainly powered by electricity. Given 
that the Company and the electricity generation mix of 
the countries in which it operates are in transition to 
renewable sources, it is estimated that the locked-in 
emissions from Telefónica's key assets and products are 
not relevant and will not hamper the achievement of net 
zero emissions in 2040.

Telefónica is not subject to the exclusions applicable in 
the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks.

Material climate-related risks
E1.SBM-3_01
Telefónica has performed a resilience analysis that seeks 
to assess its capacity to adjust or adapt its strategy and 
business model to climate change in the short, medium 
and long term. This provides a holistic approach to the 
potential negative and positive effects of climate change 
on Telefónica, and helps with the identification of 
adaptation and mitigation measures that minimise the 
negative effects and maximise the positive effects. The 
analysis included the assessment of climate-related 
physical and transition risks and opportunities.
Physical risks are understood as being the effects of 
climate change that may be triggered by (acute) events 
or long-term (chronic) changes in climate patterns. 
Transition risks are understood as being the effects 
derived from the transformation of the economy and 
society into a low-emissions scenario.
To identify each of these types of risks/opportunities, the 
list of climate-related hazards and transition events in 
ESRS 2 IRO-1 AR11 of the CSRD was taken into account. 
This made it possible to include in the analysis multiple 
climate-related hazards, some of which were considered 
not applicable to Telefónica. The following list shows the 
potentially material risks and opportunities for the Group:

E1.SBM-3_02
The resilience analysis took into consideration the 
Company’s operations in its main markets: Spain, 
Germany and Brazil, as well as in Argentina, Colombia, 
Chile and Peru, which together represent 91% of total 
revenues.
The scope of the analysis centres on the Group's main 
economic activities, specifically on telecommunications 
services (fixed, network, mobile network and others), 
television and radio broadcasting programs, data 
processing and hosting, and IT consulting and 
installations. With regard to the assets included, base 
stations, data distribution centres (switching centres/ 
MTSO), data processing centres and warehouses were 
taken into account, as they are the most representative 
of the Company’s activity and are more exposed to the 
effects of climate change. Linear infrastructure, both 
terrestrial and submarine, was not included, nor were 
less representative assets such as shops, offices, 
workshops and landing stations.
Taking into account upstream value chain activities, it 
was identified that energy suppliers could experience an 
increase in costs deriving from factors such as the 
occurrence of extreme climate events like drought and 
the implementation of new climate-related regulations 
(E1_RI01, E1_RI04). This could imply a risk for the Group, as 
these increases in costs would be passed on to 
Telefónica through electricity prices.
On the other hand, a positive impact was identified 
(E1_OP02) in the downstream activities, linked to growing 
demand from customers for low-carbon products and 
services, driven by the need for technological solutions 
that contribute to their decarbonisation and improved 
sustainability.
Phases of the resilience analysis
E1.SBM-3_03, E1.SBM-3_04
The resilience analysis performed in 2024 was based on 
the following activities:
• Identification of risks and opportunities applicable to 
the Company: in order to comply with the new 
reporting requirements, the list of hazards included in 
the European Taxonomy and CSRD regulations was 
used as a starting point for physical risks. In the case of 
transition risks, the reference point was the list of 
events included in the CSRD based on the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
Based on this list, Telefónica identified the applicability 
of the hazards and events in view of their nature and 
the Group's activity.
• Sessions with expert teams for an initial qualitative 
assessment of the importance of the risks and 
opportunities: after identifying the applicable risks and 
opportunities in view of the geographical region, 
sector and specific characteristics of the Company, 
overview sessions were held with different internal 
teams and with the support of an external consultancy 
specialising in climate risk analysis to incorporate their 
expertise into the assessment. The goal of these 
sessions was to increase awareness among the expert 
teams of the importance of certain risks, leveraging 
their knowledge of the Company's history and context. 
This approach made it possible to rule out climate-
related risks and opportunities that were initially 
considered potentially applicable.
• Scenario analysis: with the goal of assessing the risks 
and opportunities quantitatively, a scenario analysis 
was carried out to explore different futures and their 
potential impacts on Telefónica. To cover a wide range 
of possibilities, two scenarios were considered for 
physical risks: a low-emissions scenario (SSP1-2-6) 
and a high-emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5)5.
For the transition risks, the Network for Greening the 
Financial System (NGFS)6 Net Zero 2050 scenario was 
used, in line with current socio-economic trends and 
global decarbonisation commitments. For further 
details on the assumptions in the scenarios and 
hypotheses on the impact the transition to a lower 
carbon economy will have, see the Physical risk 
scenario analysis and Transition risk scenario analysis 
subsections.
• Adaptation Plan: after having identified the potentially 
material risks and opportunities, Telefónica developed 
an Adaptation Plan with the aims of reducing the 
potential adverse effects of the risks and maximising 
the opportunities. This plan involves a set of activities 
designed to improve the Company’s resilience to 
potentially material climate-related risks and to seize 
the opportunities identified.
E1.SBM-3_05
Three time horizons were defined for the resilience 
analysis to allow the Company to analyse the possible 
effects of climate change and assess the potential 
impacts on its strategic goals.
In line with the main recommendations of the TCFD, the 
time horizons used in the analysis were: 2030 for the 
short-term time horizon, 2040 for the medium-term and 
2050 for the long-term time horizon. For further details 
about the time horizons used in the analysis of risks and 
opportunities, see the Time horizons used subsection.

Results of the resilience analysis
The resilience analysis made it possible to identify the 
potentially material climate-related physical and 
transition risks and opportunities for the Company, 
based on diverse scenarios and time horizons. This 
analysis provides a broad understanding of Telefónica's 
exposure and adaptation capacity in a context of climate 
challenges. Telefónica does not identify any of the 
physical or transitional risks, independently, as material. 
However, when considered together, they do exceed 
the materiality threshold established by the Group for all 
the scenarios and time horizons used in the analysis.
The resilience analysis concludes that the opportunities 
derived from the transition to a low-carbon scenario are 
greater than the potential risks derived from climate 
change.
All the climate scenarios used in the analysis deal with 
uncertainties arising out of political, technological and 
social factors, such as the fulfilment of international and 
national climate commitments. In addition, the resolution 
of the available climate projections could result in under- 
or over-estimations of the assessed hazards. To address 
these uncertainties, Telefónica regularly reviews its risk 
analysis.
It is also important to mention that Telefónica’s 
Adaptation Plan is mainly designed and structured at the 
organisational level and by asset type, with actions 
determined according to the general characteristics of 
the assets and infrastructure. The actions included in the 
plan, such as the consumption of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency projects, are carried out in all the 
countries in which Telefónica operates so that the 
assets at risk may be taken into account when defining 
the business strategy, investment decisions and current 
mitigation activities.
Although this approach makes it possible to establish 
initial strategic measures, it adds an element of 
uncertainty to the resilience analysis, as the measures in 
the plan are not specific to each asset exposed to a 
particular risk. However, the approach makes it possible 
to prioritise actions and make strategic decisions in the 
initial stages. Telefónica plans to move towards a more 
detailed analysis to reduce these uncertainties in the 
future, further strengthening the effectiveness of 
adaptation and mitigation actions.

Climate change adaptation and mitigation
Telefónica integrates the risks and opportunities 
identified into its business model through the Climate 
Action Plan, which is included in the Company’s strategy 
and financial planning. Through the diversification of 
products and services, sustainable financing models, 
and mitigation and adaptation measures such as the 
consumption of renewable energy and energy 
efficiency, the Company takes climate change into 
consideration in its strategy and financial planning. For 
further information on adaptation and mitigation 
measures, and for sustainable financing models, see 
section 2.9.3.2. Action plans.
E1.IRO-1_01
Impact on climate change
Telefónica recognises and analyses its impact on climate 
change through an annual quantification of the 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated both as a 
result of its operations (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) and 
throughout its value chain (Scope 3 emissions). The 
GHG inventory is monitored and verified by a third party 
on an annual basis. The aim of this process is to ensure 
that emissions are reported accurately and 
transparently, in line with the best international practices 
of the GHG Protocol and the new requirements of the 
CSRD. For further information on the Group's emissions, 
see section 2.9.4.3. GHG emissions in this chapter.

Process to identify and assess climate change-
related risks and opportunities
As described in the Phases of the resilience analysis 
subsection, the scenario analysis is a key stage in 
assessing the Group’s resilience. This analysis is 
performed exclusively on physical hazards and transition 
events considered potentially material to Telefónica’s 
business, and is based on the expert judgement and 
internal know-how of the different areas participating in 
the process.
E1.IRO-1_03, E1.IRO-1_05, E1.IRO-1_08, E1.IRO-1_10, E1.IRO-1_15
Time horizons used 
In line with Telefónica’s strategic targets, the climate-
related risk analysis was structured around three time 
horizons: 2030, 2040 and 2050, for which the climate 
variables of the SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5 and NGFS Net Zero 
scenarios were analysed.
This selection meets the need to anticipate, manage and 
mitigate climate-related physical and transition risks in a 
comprehensive manner, as it ensures that these 
analyses are aligned with the Company’s climate 
strategy and commitments. These horizons make it 
possible to tackle both immediate needs and long-term 
challenges and opportunities, with the results being 
integrated into strategic planning:
• Short-term (2025–2030): aligns with the Company's 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions reduction targets 
approved by the SBTi (Science-Based Targets 
initiative). During this period, Telefónica's strategic 
focus will primarily be on compliance with increasingly 
stringent climate regulations, accelerated adoption of 
renewable energy and energy efficiency 
improvements across all operations.
• Medium-term (2030–2040): represents a critical 
period in which the physical risks, especially acute

climate events such as storms and floods, start to 
intensify while the transition risks, such as 
technological and regulatory changes, also intensify. In 
this time horizon, Telefónica will work on implementing 
measures to tackle Scope 3 emissions, which include 
those of its entire value chain, in line with its target of 
net zero by 2040. This period marks a key point for 
establishing the resilience of the infrastructure and 
operations.
• Long-term (2040–2050): mainly focused on chronic 
physical risks such as sea level rise, prolonged 
droughts and sustained changes in temperature, this 
time horizon is critical for the sustainability of the 
Company’s operations in a changing climate-related 
environment. Given that Telefónica’s main 
infrastructure has a long operating life cycle, this 
horizon is crucial for planning its adaptation to the 
projected risks beyond current commitments. The 
measures taken during this period will consolidate the 
Company’s resilience and its capacity to operate in 
future climate conditions.
This integration aims to ensure that short- and medium-
term targets support a consistent transition towards the 
achievement of long-term climate commitments.
In addition, the impact of each risk and opportunity was 
analysed over the three time horizons to understand the 
evolution of these risks over time.

Physical risk scenario analysis
As part of the resilience analysis, Telefónica assessed 
the physical risks it is exposed to, using asset-level data 
for its main markets: Spain, Germany and Brazil, as well 
as for Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru, which 
together represent 91% of total revenues. Geolocation 
data was used for the main types of assets (data 
distribution centres, base stations, data processing 
centres and warehouses). This data was integrated with 
climate projection models obtained from the European 
climate observation programme, the Copernicus Climate 
Change Service (C3S). This system provides advanced 
and high-resolution data about climate variables such as 
the monthly average of average daily temperatures, the 
number of days in a month with maximum temperatures 
above 40°C, the number of frost days per month and 
consecutive dry days in a year. The use of these 
variables makes it possible to analyse the specific risks 
the Company's assets are exposed to.
For the Copernicus variables used for the scenario 
analysis, Telefónica used combined projections of the 
shared socio-economic scenarios (SSP) with the 
representative emissions concentration trajectories 
(RCP), based on the latest IPCC7 AR6 report. These 
scenarios were employed for their ability to provide a 
robust and up-to-date framework for climate risk 
analysis that was in line with the best available sources 
and methodologies. SSP projections focus on socio-
economic trajectories and how factors such as 
population, economics and technology may influence 
future emissions, whereas RCPs focus on greenhouse 
gas (GHG) concentrations and the resulting radiative 
forcing, without detailing the socio-economic causes 
behind these concentrations.
To assess a wide range of potential impacts derived 
from the physical risks to Telefónica's assets, two 
opposing scenarios were chosen:
• SSP1-2.6: this scenario (considered in the analysis as 
'optimistic') captures the conditions of SSP1 and 
RCP2.6 and projects a future in which policies focus 
on human well-being, development of clean 
technologies and preservation of the natural 
environment. It projects an economic growth based on 
energy efficiency, characterised by lower 
consumption. In line with these assumptions, a 
temperature increase of 1.5°C-2°C above pre-
industrial levels is projected by 2100. 
• SSP5-8.5: This scenario (considered in the analysis as 
'pessimistic') incorporates the conditions of SSP5 and 
RCP8.5 and projects a future in which policies focus 
on the free market and society continues to be fossil 
fuel intensive. In line with these assumptions, 
temperatures and GHG emissions are projected to 
continue to rise, leading to a temperature increase of 
5.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels by 2100 and 
an increase in economic impacts due to the effects of 
climate change.
For this analysis, the likelihood and duration of climate-
related hazards were determined by the projections of 
the variables drawn from Copernicus and NASA8 
models. Likewise, the potential magnitude of the 
damage was determined by combining the climate 
variables from Copernicus (e.g. consecutive dry days in a 
year and the fire weather index) with the damage curve 
or electricity consumption per country. Damage curves 
are graphical or mathematical representations that 
describe the percentage of the damage or the economic 
loss based on the severity of a climate hazard. They were

drawn from CLIMADA9, a well-known database for 
assessing climate-related risks.
In order to calculate the financial impact, the likelihood, 
magnitude and duration were combined with specific 
information such as the geolocation of the assets, their 
economic value and other relevant variables, like energy 
prices or energy consumption at the asset-type level.
The consequences of the physical risks were divided 
into three main impact categories, each with a specific 
calculation methodology.
• Energy consequences: linked to the increase in energy 
consumption and the variability of electricity prices as 
a result of the physical risks.
• Consequences of the failure/destruction of assets: 
related to the deterioration, loss in value or total 
destruction of the assets.
• Consequences of lost profits: referring to the loss of 
revenues due to the interruption of the services 
offered by the affected assets.
To estimate the impacts, two methodological 
approaches were defined:
• Methodology for calculating the impact of risks with 
energy consequences: Telefónica's assets were 
included using their geographic coordinates. This 
information was combined with internal energy 
consumption data at country level, real data linked to 
the variability of electricity prices by climate event and 
country, and the Copernicus climate variable 
projections associated with each risk.
• Methodology for calculating the impact of risks with 
consequences of failure/destruction of assets and lost 
profits: Telefónica's assets were included using their 
geographic coordinates. This information was 
combined with the Copernicus and NASA variables 
associated with each risk, as well as the economic 
valuations of each asset and the damage curves from 
the CLIMADA model.
Transition risk scenario analysis
E1.IRO-1_09, E1.IRO-1_12, E1.IRO-1_13, E1.IRO-1_19, E1.IRO-1_20
As part of the resilience analysis, Telefónica assessed 
the transition risks it is exposed to. The scope of the 
analysis focused on the Group's main economic 
activities, specifically on telecommunications services 
(fixed network, mobile network and others), television 
and radio broadcasting programs, data processing and 
hosting, consulting and IT installations, in Spain, 
Germany, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Peru, 
which together represent 91% of total revenues.
For transition risk the Network for Greening the Financial 
System (NGFS) Net Zero 2050 scenario was used, 
which is consistent with the Paris Agreement and a 
future where global temperature rise is limited to 1.5ºC.
For this analysis, the likelihood and magnitude of  
transition events were determined by the socio-
economic variables drawn from either the NGFS 
scenario or the quantitative projections prepared by 
Telefónica (e.g. savings due to purchase agreements for 
renewable energy or the sustainable debt ratio trend), 
based on primary data and internal commitments. The 
period considered for the duration of the events was 
2024-2050, as this is a period in which global climate 
change commitments to achieving net zero emissions 
are expected to be met. The potential financial effects of 
the transition risks in the short, medium and long term 
were calculated by combining the variables of the 
scenarios and internal projections, or were simply based 
on internal projections.
Country-level (Germany, Spain, Brazil, Colombia, 
Argentina and Peru) variables from the NGFS scenario 
were used, such as carbon prices, electricity prices and 
fossil fuel prices. These variables were used in 
combination with Telefónica’s projections to calculate 
the financial impact of the transition risks related to an 
increase in operational costs due to carbon taxes on 
energy suppliers, exposure to the variation in carbon 
credit prices and those related to energy consumption 
(e.g. energy efficiency). For the remaining transition 
events, internal projections based on primary data and 
internal commitments were used, such as savings from 
PPA and increases in sustainable debt.
The analysis was based on a series of hypotheses about 
the evolution of emissions, macro-economic trends, 
energy consumption and technology deployment:
• Emissions: global CO2 emissions reach or approach 
zero by 2050. Countries that had a political 
commitment in place by the end of March 2024 to 
achieve net zero meet this target before or after 2050. 
This is possible by implementing more stringent 
policies in the short term, such as carbon pricing. 
Carbon pricing is set so as to meet the emissions limits 
defined in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, generating 
substitution effects: emitting technologies become 
more expensive and investment in cheaper, low-
carbon alternatives is encouraged.
• Macro-economic trends: one of the main assumptions 
about socio-economic drivers is for a balanced growth 
of the population and the economy at the global level 
(through higher GDP and lower inflation levels). In 
addition, business opportunities are expected to 
emerge based on green sectors or products and

individuals to decarbonise, thus incentivising 
innovation. 
• Consumption and the energy mix: greater efficiency in 
processes will allow for lower energy intensity. 
Likewise, greater consumption and investment in 
renewable energy is expected to reduce dependence 
on fossil fuels.
• Technology deployment: a rapid increase in 
technological innovation based on the need to adapt 
and taking advantage of the opportunities arising from 
the transition to a low-carbon scenario.
E1.IRO-1_14
As a member of the telecommunications sector, 
Telefónica has no assets or activities that are identified 
as incompatible with the transition to a carbon-neutral 
economy. The European telecommunications sector 
contributes to the fight against climate change through 
the decarbonisation of its operations, the deployment of 
more efficient networks and the development of smart 
solutions to reduce environmental impacts in other 
sectors. However, the transition risk and opportunity 
analysis enables the identification of actions that ensure 
a better adaptation to a low carbon future.
E1-2, MDR-P
2.9.3.1. Policies
E1.MDR-P_01-06
The content, implementation process and 
responsibilities associated with the policies can be found 
in the following section of the Sustainability notes:
 2.15. Policies
E1-2_01
The Company’s policies address climate change issues 
—mitigation, adaptation and energy efficiency—across 
the board, through the Global Environmental and Energy 
Policy and the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.
Global Environmental and Energy Policy
The Global Environmental and Energy Policy sets out 
the guidelines that help the Company to support and 
improve its environmental and energy performance 
globally and locally. Specifically, it includes issues 
relating to climate change mitigation and adaptation, 
and reflects the commitment to consume energy 
efficiently and reduce GHG emissions, which allows 
Telefónica to continue to make progress towards 
achieving net zero emissions by 2040, including in its 
value chain.
The main objectives of the policy refer to: legal 
compliance with the applicable requirements, reducing 
the impact on the environment, collaborating with 
suppliers to reduce their carbon emissions, managing 
the impacts, risks and opportunities of climate change, 
and fostering the development of digital solutions to 
address environmental challenges.
Based on a firm commitment to accelerating the 
transition to a decarbonised company and decoupling 
business growth from GHG emissions, and in 
accordance with the provisions of the policy, all the 
companies of the Telefónica Group must work on the 
following:
• Defining short-, medium- and long-term Scopes 1, 2 
and 3 GHG emissions reduction targets that are 
science based and externally validated.
• Transitioning to 100% renewable electricity 
consumption in their own operations (assets under 
operational control), in order to minimise the 
Company's carbon footprint.
• Reducing the use of fossil fuels in their own 
operations, promoting the adoption of cleaner and 
alternative forms of energy.
• Incorporating innovative measures that lead 
Telefónica progressively towards a net zero emissions 
scenario.
• Offsetting/neutralising residual emissions in 
accordance with Company requirements.
• Minimising the impact of refrigerant gases.
• Promoting energy efficiency measures, both in the 
design and the operation of facilities and 
infrastructure.
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy
The purpose of this policy is to establish sustainability 
requirements for Telefónica's suppliers. The policy sets 
minimum responsible business criteria related to climate 
change impact mitigation measures and energy 
efficiency that must be fulfilled by suppliers. Specifically, 
it sets the following criteria:
• Climate change: the supplier shall take action to 
minimise the impact of its activities on climate change 
and consider the entire supply chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3 
GHG emissions) in its planning for such action. It must 
work to reduce its GHG emissions by setting reduction 
targets for the next three years, which should, as far as 
possible, be science based. To this end, it will promote 
energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives in 
its own activities. The supplier will respond 
Telefónica's requests for data on GHG emissions or 
energy consumption corresponding to the products 
and services it provides to Telefónica.
• Refrigerant gases: the supplier shall not supply 
equipment containing ozone-depleting gases (such as 
CFC or HCFC), nor shall it recharge with these gases, 
unless expressly authorised to do so by Telefónica.

2.9.3.2. Action plans
Decarbonisation levers
E1-4_23
In order to meet its emissions reduction targets, 
Telefónica has defined a set of decarbonisation levers. 
These are classified according to their impact on 
operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) and on indirect 
value chain emissions (Scope 3):
• Energy consumption: this lever consolidates the 
emissions reductions achieved and planned by actions 
1. Renewable Energy Plan and 2. Energy efficiency 
projects, described in the Adaptation and mitigation 
actions subsection of this section (2.9.3.2. Action 
plans).
• Supplier engagement.
• Circular economy of equipment and others.

It is estimated that the implementation of these levers 
will achieve the following reductions:

The 2030 emissions projections were calculated based 
on the activity data from Telefónica’s 2024-2026 
Strategic Plan and market trend forecasts (renewable 
energy targets, fuels reduction in operations and fleet, 
reduction of refrigerant gases leaks, the emissions 
reduction targets of Telefónica's main suppliers, trends 
in the energy mix in the countries where Telefónica 
operates or changes in the composition of the fuels used 
for mobility, according to existing policies and forecasts).
Due to the uncertainty associated with internal and 
external factors beyond 2030, there is no quantification 
of the emissions reductions expected for 2040 beyond 
the achievement of the net zero target, which implies 
reducing emissions by 90% compared to the base year. 
This leads to total projected emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 
3) of around 470,000 tCO2e and a reduction of 4.2 
million tCO2e from 2015 onwards.
For further information about the activities carried out, 
the incorporation of new technologies and their role in 
reducing emissions and meeting the targets set in 
climate-related policies, see the Adaptation and 
mitigation actions subsection.
E1-4_24
A scenario compatible with limiting global warming to 
1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels was used as a basis for 
defining the decarbonisation levers. This scenario 
assumes the achievement of net zero emissions by 2040 
through a significant increase in consumption of 
renewable energy, together with improvements in the 
Group’s technologies and infrastructure that increase 
energy efficiency. It also foresees greater climate action 
in the value chain, including promotion of the circular 
economy and setting emissions reduction targets for the 
main suppliers.
Adaptation and mitigation actions
E1.MDR-A_01-12
These are the climate change adaptation and mitigation 
actions that Telefónica is working on:
1. Renewable Energy Plan.
2. Energy efficiency projects.
3. Supplier engagement.

5. Business Continuity Plans.
6. Insurance Programs and Coverage for climate-related 
events.

1. Renewable Energy Plan
In 2024, the consumption of renewable energy 
continued to increase through Telefónica's Renewable 
Energy Plan.
The consumption of renewable energy contributes to 
fulfilling the key objectives of Telefónica’s Global 
Environmental and Energy Policy, specifically to the 
management of environmental risks and the

achievement of net zero carbon emissions at the 
Company. This action contributes to reducing Scope 2 
emissions and category 3 of Scope 3 emissions 
(emissions associated with the life cycle of fossil energy).
The strategy of consuming renewable energy helps to 
mitigate the potential transitional climate risks 
associated with the increase in costs derived from 
carbon (E1_RI02) and electricity prices, (E1_RI04) and the 
uncertainty about carbon credit prices (E1_RI02, E1_RI03). For 
example, long-term power purchase agreements reduce 
exposure to price volatility, making it unnecessary to 
acquire carbon credits and assume additional indirect 
costs passed on by energy suppliers subject to carbon 
mechanisms.
This action also contributes to adaptation to physical 
climate-related risks (E1_RI01), such as drought and 
precipitation variability. Increasing the self-generation of 
photovoltaic renewable energy diminishes dependence 
on other sources such as hydroelectric, which is more 
exposed to prolonged episodes of drought. The 
Renewable Energy Plan not only promotes adaptation to 
and mitigation of the potential effects of climate change, 
but also leverages it as a market opportunity to reduce 
operating costs and strengthen the Company’s 
competitiveness (E1_OP04).
The main goal of this action is to achieve 100% 
consumption of renewable energy by 2030 and 
contribute to enhancing the resilience of all Telefónica’s 
operations.
The scope of the Renewable Energy Plan, and therefore 
the consumption of this type of energy, is applicable to 
all Telefónica operations in all the countries in which it 
operates. Renewable energy consumption involves 
three groups of activities:
1. Self-generation of renewable energy: by the end of 
the year, Telefónica had 517 self-generation systems 
installed in both its own fixed network buildings and its 
own mobile network base stations. Last year, the self-
generation of renewable energy represented the 
production of around 7,377 MWh per year, which is set 
to gradually increase. These facilities enable the 
improvement of electricity consumption through 
renewable sources and the phasing out of fossil fuel 
generators in isolated base stations (off-grid), 
achieving reductions in consumption of between 60% 
and 80% in 2024. During the year, 33 self-generation 
projects were implemented.
2.Purchase of renewable electricity with guarantees of 
origin: this covers up to 100% of electricity 
consumption at Telefónica Spain, Telefónica Germany, 
Telefónica Brazil, Telefónica Chile and Telefónica Peru, 
and has been expanded to other markets. In 2024, 
Telefónica Argentina, Telefónica Colombia and 
Telefónica Ecuador continued to increase their 
renewable electricity consumption to 60%, 93% and 
68% respectively. Likewise, in Latin American 
operations, the first multi-country and multi-year 
purchase (2024-2026) was awarded to acquire 
certificates of origin (IREC) for a volume of 489 GWh in 
2024, 846 GWh in 2025 and 981 GWh in 2026.
3.Long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs): these 
agreements are designed to promote the construction 
of renewable energy facilities and move towards 
achieving the commitment to being 100% renewable. 
These contracts contribute to increasing the 
percentage of renewable energy in countries' energy 
mixes, facilitating the achievement of medium- and 
long-term consumption commitments under the PPA 
model.
At Telefónica Spain, there are five PPAs in operation 
representing a capacity of 582 GWh/year. The 
agreements cover 52% of the power consumption for 
the operator’s technical buildings. In addition, Telefónica 
Germany has signed two PPAs which will be in force 
between 2025 and 2040 and are equivalent to 550 
GWh a year, therefore covering 87% of the total energy 
consumption of its operations. Noteworthy at Telefónica 
Brazil is the continuation of the distributed generation 
(DG) project, with the installation of 72 renewable 
energy plants with a production of 650 GWh. Upon 
completion of the project's implementation, these plants 
will produce more than 710 GWh per year, reducing 
dependence on renewable energy certificates or IREC.
This action is considered to be currently in progress and 
will be completed in the short term (by 2030) to 
contribute to achieving the climate-related targets.
In 2024, consumption of renewable energy increased by  
6%compared to the previous year, reaching 89% of total 
electricity consumption in Telefónica facilities.
2. Energy efficiency projects
In 2024, Telefónica continued to increase the energy 
efficiency of its operations through its Energy Efficiency 
Plan.
Improving energy efficiency is one of the main 
commitments established in the Global Environmental 
and Energy Policy. This action not only strives to make 
optimised use of energy but also enables the 
achievement of two objectives: management of 
environmental risks and the commitment to achieving 
net zero emissions at the Company. This initiative 
contributes to reducing Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and

those in category 3 of Scope 3 (emissions associated 
with the life cycle of fossil energy), thus mitigating the 
effects of climate change and moving the Company 
closer to reaching its decarbonisation target.
The strategy of improving energy efficiency helps 
mitigate potential transitional climate risks associated 
with the increase in costs derived from carbon (E1_RI02), 
and electricity prices (E1_RI04) and the uncertainty about 
carbon credit prices (E1_RI02, E1_RI03). Optimising efficiency 
in operations makes it possible to reduce electricity 
consumption, which reduces exposure to the volatility of 
electricity prices and avoids the need to acquire carbon 
credits or assume additional costs associated with 
energy suppliers subject to carbon-related regulations.
At the same time, it serves as an adaptation measure to 
extreme climate events such as heat waves and cold 
snaps (E1_RI01). By implementing more efficient processes 
and equipment, the Company intends to adapt HVAC to 
a context of extreme temperatures, ensuring an optimal 
environment in which the infrastructure is operative and 
workers can perform their jobs in a safe setting.
The expected result of this action is the improvement of 
energy consumption per unit of Company traffic (MWh/
Petabyte) by 95% by 2030 compared to 2015. The aim of 
this target is to keep energy consumption stable over 
time, thereby decoupling the growth of data traffic on 
Telefónica's networks from the emissions associated 
with its operations. Through the Energy Efficiency Plan, 
Telefónica not only promotes adaptation to and 
mitigation of the potential effects of climate change but 
also transforms it into a market opportunity to reduce 
operating costs and strengthen the Company’s 
competitiveness (E1_OP03).
The scope of the Energy Efficiency Plan extends to all 
Telefónica operations in all the countries in which it 
operates. Energy efficiency is achieved through the 
following activities:
• Network transformation: estimated savings of 177,708 
MWh 2024 through the following initiatives:
◦Deployment of new generation networks, fibre optic 
and 5G, and the shutdown of legacy networks: the 
Company moved ahead with shutting down 2G and 
3G networks, compacting equipment and replacing 
the copper network with fibre optics, which is 85% 
more efficient in terms of customer access 
(according to empirical measurements by Telefónica 
and in consensus with the sector). In 2020, 
Telefónica presented the results of a study based on 
real measurements which demonstrated that 5G 
technology is up to 90% more efficient than 4G in 
terms of energy consumption per unit of traffic 
(MWh/Petabyte). In 2023, after several comparative 
exercises, it was concluded that energy efficiency in 
virtualised environments is up to 27% higher than in 
legacy environments.
In alignment with the copper shutdown plan, 
Telefónica Spain closed 3,671 plants in 2024 (7,820 
since 2014). In turn, the operations in 
Hispanoamerica made progress with their multi-
layer shutdowns saving 33 GWh in 2024. For 
example, Telefónica Uruguay successfully shut 
down 100% of the 2G mobile network (including 
controllers) in January 2024, and Telefónica 
Argentina shut down 100% of the 2G mobile 
network in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area – La 
Plata in June. In the fixed network, Telefónica 
Hispam shut down more than 1,362 plants and 3,492 
DSLAMs.
◦Compacting and consolidation of technical rooms: 
The objective is to bring the occupancy level of all 
critical sites closer to the target of 80%, which 
allows the designed PUE levels to be achieved. The 
Company is carrying out a study of its infrastructure 
with the goal of categorising the sites based on their 
reliability and efficiency. This will make it possible to 
perform consolidation projects and transfer loads to 
more efficient buildings. Telefónica Germany is 
executing a consolidation project involving data 
centres and core plants, which will enable it to 
reduce electricity consumption in addition to 
strengthening its network.
• Modernisation of equipment:
◦Equipment has been replaced with more efficient 
models, and technological innovations such as 
rectifiers, power plants, external panels and 
uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems have 
been incorporated into electrical infrastructure. 
Savings of 1,250 MWh were calculated for 2024.
There is also work ongoing to upgrade cooling 
equipment to improve energy efficiency, with 
estimated savings of 33,128 MWh per year in 2024. 
Other initiatives are being promoted, such as 
adjusting the temperature set point in cooling 
systems, free cooling in technical rooms utilising air 
from outside, and advanced technologies such as 
liquid cooling by immersion. An energy monitoring 
system has been implemented in one of the Group's 
data centres with the aim of verifying the real 
efficiencies delivered by the use of chillers with 
magnetic levitation compressors, which were 
installed in 2023. Telefónica Spain continued with 
the ‘Apagado Milles’ (Switch Off Thousands) project, 
which consists of matching the climate control 
equipment to the actual load and shutting down 572 
devices, bringing estimated savings of 17 GWh in 
2024.

• Power saving features (PSFs): this initiative is 
expected to save 21,606 MWh in 2024. It consists of 
implementing energy saving systems during periods of 
low traffic, delivering reductions of up to 30%. In 2024, 
14 new PSFs were put into operation in the 4G and 5G 
networks in the main markets (Spain, Brazil and 
Germany), without compromising service quality. 
Thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and 
machine learning algorithms, known as phase learning, 
which act on top of these features, it is possible to 
predict the behaviour of future traffic and activate 
cell-sleep states 24 hours a day.
• Other energy efficiency measures in 2024:
◦Replacement of fluorescent lighting with LED 
technology. This initiative saved 5,259 MWh.
◦Power-factor correction and installation of 
occupancy sensors and smart meters, among 
others. This initiative is estimated to save  
2,770MWh.
◦Leakage control, preventive maintenance and 
replacement of refrigerant gases: digitalising the 
process of managing operational fuel consumption 
data and refrigerant gas recharge data optimises 
monitoring for leakage of these gases. This, together 
with the preventive maintenance performed, 
reduces gas leaks. At Telefónica Brazil, digitalisation 
of the management process increased the reliability 
of data through continuous monitoring, which 
enabled a reduction in refrigerant gas recharges of 
9% compared to 2023. At Telefónica Argentina, a 
mobile application was implemented in June 2024 to 
digitalise and manage fuel and refrigerant gas 
consumption, as a result of which savings of 34% in 
fuel and 10% in refrigerant gases were achieved 
compared to the same period in the previous year. 
When purchasing new HVAC equipment, and when 
replacing these gases in existing equipment, the 
global warming potential (GWP) is taken into 
consideration to ensure that it is lower.
◦Replacement of diesel with natural gas or propane 
gas in boilers, which reduces the emissions 
associated with heating in the facilities, as these 
fuels generate fewer emissions for the same amount 
of heat produced during combustion processes.
◦Replacement of generator fuel. Telefónica Germany 
deployed two off-grid mobile sites equipped with 
methanol and solar panels. These solutions ensure 
the independent functioning of the sites and 
generate estimated savings of approximately 13 
MWh a year compared to a conventional mobile site. 
Additionally, a feasibility study was conducted on 
the use of HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil (a 
second-generation renewable diesel produced from 
waste), in the emergency generators located at 
Telefónica Spain's plants and data centres. This fuel 
reduces Scope 1 emissions up to 90% and improves 
operation due to its greater stability compared to 
fossil diesel, making its use appropriate for 
emergency generators.
◦Reduction of fuel consumption: the extension of 
battery autonomy, the implementation of BaaS 
(Battery as a Service), the adjustment of capacity 
according to demand and the replacement of 
generator sets reduce diesel consumption and 
maintenance costs. Telefónica Colombia carried out 
a pilot scheme for Starfuel at the Chocontá earth 
station. This type of fuel (diesel) incorporates green 
hydrogen at 12%. This combination reduces CO2e 
emissions by approximately 10% and reduces the 
consumption/energy ratio (gl/KWh) by 21%.
◦Installation of lithium batteries: the implementation 
of delayed start-up logic for emergency generators 
using high-cycle (lithium) batteries at sites with 
frequent power outages reduces generator 
operation and saves fuel. Telefónica Venezuela 
implemented the battery cycling project at 35 sites. 
The aim of this initiative is to reduce average fuel 
consumption by 31% by delaying the start-up of the 
generator and  allowing the batteries to be cycled 
during the first phase of the commercial power 
outage.
◦Replacement of vehicles and gradual reduction of 
the fleet of vehicles: replacing the fleet of vehicles 
that consume fossil fuels with electric vehicles or 
those that use biofuels, such as ethanol, reduces 
Scope 1 emissions. Telefónica Spain renewed its 
operational fleet of vehicles, reducing the vehicle 
fleet by 41% and increasing the purchase of electric 
vehicles by 50%, going from 24 to 42 vehicles in 
2024. The impact has been a reduction of 
approximately 19% in the carbon footprint of the 
vehicle fleet.
This action is considered to be currently in progress and 
will be completed in the short term (by 2030) to facilitate 
the achievement of the climate-related targets.
In 2024, energy consumption per unit of traffic was 38  
(MWh/Petabyte). This ratio has improved by 90% 
compared to 2015.
This energy intensity metric (MWh/PetaBytes) is the 
ratio of total energy consumption (fuel consumption in 
operations and vehicle fleet and electricity 
consumption), divided by the volume of data traffic in 
PetaBytes.
The traffic used is the annual volume of data traffic 
(mobile and fixed) carried on Telefónica's data access 
networks. It is aggregated both in the downstream 
direction (network-customer) and in the upstream

direction (customer-network). The units in which it is 
expressed are PetaBytes (10^15 Bytes).
3. Supplier engagement
Scope 3 emissions represent a significant portion of the 
Company's carbon footprint. In fact, more than half of 
Scope 3 emissions are derived from the activities of 
Telefónica's main suppliers (category 1 and 2) found in its 
supply chain. Hence, it is essential to engage with 
suppliers to mitigate their emissions and, therefore, drive 
Scope 3 emissions reductions. This action contributes to 
achieving the target of net zero emissions in the Global 
Environmental and Energy Policy, as well as the target of 
minimising the adverse impact of suppliers on climate 
change, set in the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy.
Furthermore, engaging with suppliers and potentially 
reducing Scope 3 emissions as a result, contributes to 
mitigating, inter alia, the potential climate-related 
transition risks associated with the uncertainty of carbon 
credit prices derived from Telefónica's commitment to 
purchase these (E1_RI03). It is expected that by achieving 
emissions reductions, a smaller number of carbon 
credits will need to be purchased, and therefore the 
exposure to uncertainty about the prices and their 
potential rise will decrease.
To this end, in 2024, Telefónica carried out engagement 
initiatives with its suppliers, which were structured into 
three priority groups.
The scope of these initiatives varies depending on the 
suppliers’ contribution to Telefónica's footprint. 
As a starting point and to establish a common basis for all 
suppliers within the Company’s Procurement Model, 
suppliers are required to accept the Supply Chain 
Sustainability Policy, which includes, among other things, 
requirements for the calculation and reduction of emissions. 
This policy defines the minimum requirements for all 
Telefónica’s Scope 3 emissions within categories 1 and 2.  
Subsequently, Telefónica categorises the suppliers 
based on their contribution to the Group’s footprint and 
groups them into three priority levels (1, 2 and 3):  
• Priority group 1: comprises 44 key suppliers in terms of 
ICT sector emissions, of which 27 are also its suppliers 
and make up 23%11 of Telefónica's supply chain 
emissions.  
• Priority group 2: comprises 82 suppliers that make up 
79%12 of Telefónica's supply chain emissions.
• Priority group 3: comprises 188 suppliers that make up 
88%13 of Telefónica’s supply chain emissions. 
The suppliers in priority group 3 are invited to participate 
in the following engagement initiatives:    
◦CDP Supply Chain campaign: key suppliers in terms 
of emissions are invited to participate in the CDP 
Supply Chain program, where they provide 
information about their strategy, targets and climate 
actions. 
◦Supplier Engagement Programme (SEP): the 
suppliers’ climate management maturity is assessed 
based on the information gathered in the CDP 
Supply Chain campaign. The analysis is shared with 
the suppliers, and various actions are taken as part 
of the programme in order to improve their climate 
management. These actions include the 
identification of improvement areas through a 
pledge model and capacity-building webinars.  
Furthermore, in 2022, Telefónica established the 
following additional requirement for suppliers in priority 
group 2: 
◦SBTi requirement: a requirement for suppliers to 
commit to establishing science-based emissions 
reduction targets and have these validated by the 
Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This 
commitment is monitored regularly.  
Additionally, those suppliers who are also part of priority 
group 1 as a result of their GHG emissions contribution to 
the ICT sector are invited to participate in a collaborative 
initiative called the Carbon Reduction Programme 
(CRP). 
• The CRP is a programme managed through the sector 
initiative Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) that aims to 
further GHG emissions reduction at the product level. 
In it, the suppliers that work alongside the Company 
identify the most carbon-intensive products and, 
through a lifecycle analysis (LCA), determine which 
production stages offer the greatest emissions 
reduction potential. The aim is to use this analysis as a 
basis for agreeing on reduction plans specific to these 
products with the suppliers. In 2024, 44 suppliers were 
engaged through the CRP, the majority of which were 
also Telefónica suppliers.   
It is worth mentioning that the scopes of both the SEP 
and the CRP have widened since their initial 
implementation.

11 This percentage equals the total emissions attributed to Telefónica's suppliers participating in the CRP. This number is divided by the total of Telefónica's 
Scope 3 categories 1 and 2 emissions in 2023, the calculation of emissions available at the time these suppliers were invited to the initiative in 2024.
12 This percentage equals the total emissions attributed to all suppliers from which Telefónica has requested the SBTi requirement, divided by the total of 
Telefónica's Scope 3 categories 1 and 2 emissions in 2023. 
13 This percentage equals the total emissions attributed to all suppliers invited by Telefónica to complete the CDP Supply Chain questionnaire, divided by the 
total of Telefónica's Scope 3 categories 1 and 2 emissions in 2023, the available Group emissions calculation when these suppliers were invited to join the 
initiative in 2024. 

Telefónica launched the SEP in 2022 and since then it 
has been raised to the sector level, incorporating the 
efforts of other companies within the JAC sector 
initiative. With the broadening of its scope, the SEP 
includes nearly 900 suppliers, including also those 
suppliers in priority group 3 .  
Similarly, in 2023, the CRP initiative was promoted by 
the Company with the support of another three 
telecommunications operators. Following its proven 
success, in 2024, the scope of the project in the ICT 
sector tripled, growing to a dozen operators, including 
Telefónica. 
All in all, supplier engagement as an adaptation and 
mitigation action is considered to be currently in 
progress and will be completed in the short term (by 
2030) to facilitate the achievement of the climate-
related targets.
4. Circular economy for equipment
Telefónica promotes the refurbishment and reuse of fixed 
customer equipment, such as routers and set-top boxes, 
mobile telephones and electronic operations equipment, 
through different initiatives.
Integrating circularity criteria into Telefónica’s business 
models contributes to achieving net zero carbon emissions 
at the Company, as the reuse of equipment extends its 
lifespan and avoids the emissions associated with 
extracting the materials needed to manufacture new 
devices, which would be necessary if the current 
equipment was not reused. It also reduces the emissions 
associated with the equipment's manufacturing process, 
which are greater than the emissions generated by 
refurbishment.
These initiatives help to decrease Scope 3 emissions, mainly 
in categories 1 and 2. These are the emissions generated by 
manufacturing the products and capital goods that 
Telefónica acquires. Decreasing them therefore mitigates 
the effects of climate change and brings the Company 
closer to achieving its decarbonisation target.
All the information related to the actions established to 
foster the circular economy is contained in the chapter:
 2.10. ESRS E5 - Circular economy
5. Business Continuity Plans
During 2024, Telefónica continued working on 
developing the Business Continuity Plans. Some of them 
take into consideration the risks deriving from extreme 
climate events. This action contributes to the 
achievement of one of the targets of the Global 
Environmental and Energy Policy: effective management 
of environmental risks. 
In addition, it contributes to the implementation of the 
guidelines established in the Global Business Continuity 
Regulation, which mandates the preventive 
management of risks. The main result anticipated from 
this action is to improve the Company’s resilience, that is, 
a greater capacity to respond and adapt in the face of 
any possible interruption related to climate change. 
(E1_RI01).
The Business Continuity Plans are applicable to all 
relevant Company processes and services. They 
establish the activities for contingency operations in 
different risk scenarios that exceed the risk appetite. As 
a starting point, in 2025 the Global Business Continuity 
Office will promote the analysis of risk treatment plans 
that include climate-related hazards.
Additionally, the crisis management system, through 
which the events that materialise and have a significant 
impact on the Company are managed, has a Crisis 
Committee structure (Local Crisis Committees, one per 
business unit, and a Global Crisis Committee). These are 
activated when required and are backed by specialists 
for each type of incident.
Crisis management and business continuity are both 
supported by activities such as:
• Analysis of Risk Treatment Plans (RTP), which includes 
climate-related hazards (natural disasters, disasters 
caused by fire or by water) in relevant processes.
• Development of Local Crisis Management Plans based 
on the Global Crisis Management System, which 
establishes the type of crisis, the phases and the 
governance model.
• The Strategic Plan of the Global Security and 
Intelligence Directorate, a plan that sets out three-year 
global security and intelligence plans, including the 
Global Crisis Management Plan, which encompasses 
the Crisis Management and Business Continuity 
projects.
There is a Security Advisory Board, which is made up of 
major security and intelligence figures from outside the 
Company and has the aim of contributing best practices, 
increasing the efficiency of capabilities and procedures, 
and enhancing the quality of the Company's strategy in 
this area.
This action is considered to be in continuous 
development and under regular review, and is projected 
to be completed in the short and medium term, with a 
time horizon set to 2040, given its essential nature within 
the Company’s strategy.
During 2024, new Business Continuity Plans were 
developed, considering risks derived from climate-
related events such as floods, fires and other natural 
disasters (e.g. cyclones, hurricanes, landslides). These 
made it possible to improve the Business Continuity 
maturity level of the Telefónica Group.

In addition, two crises considered relevant, due to 
climate-related events, were managed by the Local 
Crisis Committees:
One of the relevant crisis management processes was 
associated with the DANA, the Spanish acronym for 
high-altitude isolated depression, in Valencia (Spain). 
This extreme weather event caused severe damage to 
Telefónica's infrastructure due to the lack or electricity 
supply instability and the washout of water and flooding. 
Both fixed service (loss of service in 30% of the province 
of Valencia) and mobile service (with a maximum of 245 
base stations down, 22% of the province of Valencia) 
were affected, resulting in the isolation of entire 
municipalities (104 at the worst moment).
Recovery was not only due to the complexity of the 
failures, but also to the difficult access to the affected 
areas. In the first instance, the priority was to re-
establish critical and emergency services such as 112, 
hospital and outpatient centres, as well as command or 
control centres (security forces). Once these services 
were stabilised, the focus shifted to restoring fixed and 
mobile infrastructure so that citizens could be 
connected again.
In just three days, more than 50% of the fixed and mobile 
services had been recovered, and after 10 days, 100% of 
the infrastructures had been recovered. 
The event has accelerated the learning curve, 
reinforcing the effectiveness of internal crisis 
management procedures.
Another of the crisis management processes considered 
as relevant in 2024 was the management of the floods 
and landslides that occurred between April and May in 
the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. These events 
affected the supply of essential services, such as energy 
and telecommunications. At peak of the crisis, 31 cities 
were isolated and at least 200 others had some form of 
partial disruption.
To ensure emergency connectivity for the people of Rio 
Grande do Sul, Vivo, a Telefónica Group company, and 
other operators provided free network roaming. In 
addition, Vivo provided 60 satellite phones to the Civil 
Protection of Rio Grande do Sul to use in extreme 
situations.
In order to restore services as soon as possible, the 
Business Continuity Management (BCM) area 
established the Public Calamity Crisis Table—comprising 
19 areas of the Company—. Joint actions, as well as the 
work of the entire field team, dedicated to normalising 
services, ensured greater agility and efficiency in 
restoring connectivity for the people. 
6. Insurance Programs and Coverage for 
climate-related events
During 2024, the Group's Property Damage and Loss of 
Profit Program was renewed, its objective is to provide 
total or partial coverage for potential economic losses 
that the Telefónica Group may suffer as a result of a 
property damage event or natural catastrophe and 
which includes damages, losses and harm derived from 
the occurrence of climate-related events in any of the 
countries or territories in which Telefónica has 
operations and provides services (E1_RI01). This program 
has been renewed for a period of one year and will 
expire on 20 March 2026.
This action contributes to the achievement of one of the 
key objectives of the Global Environmental and Energy 
Policy: the effective management of environmental risks.
The program is based on the risk management 
methodology for identifying, assessing, managing and 
transferring the climate risks that may affect the assets 
of the Group and its income statements/balance sheets, 
thereby affecting the Group's achievement of its main 
targets and strategy.
The main result expected from this action is the 
coverage of damages and losses suffered by the Group’s 
assets, goods, income statement and balance sheet that 
allows for the quickest and most effective way to replace 
and/or rebuild damaged or lost assets and goods and 
meet the Company’s economic targets. In addition to 
improving the Company’s resilience, that is, its capacity 
to respond and adapt in the face of any possible 
interruption related to climate change.
In order to protect Telefónica's assets, goods, balance 
sheet and income statement, the Corporate Risk and 
Insurance Department carries out risk modelling for 
natural events, including physical events arising from 
climate change, in all countries in which the Group 
operates. The aim is to determine potential maximum 
losses in certain return periods in the event of different 
types of natural and climate events by using the models 
of different suppliers such as RMS and KatRisk.
The result of this analysis is key to understanding the 
Group's risks and exposure. In addition, it provides the 
basis and framework for designing the most efficient and 
complete insurance structure, helping to determine, for 
example, the limits, withholdings and deductibles both 
for the Group and for each country.
This action is considered to be in continuous 
development given its essential nature within the 
Company’s strategy.
During the 2024 financial year, the baseline data 
collection sheets used for vulnerability analysis were 
improved. This made it possible to improve the efficiency 
of the process of analysing, reviewing and modelling the

global insurance scheme that encompasses, among 
other things, extreme climate events.
In addition, floods were included as a hazard in risk 
modelling in several countries where this was not 
previously available.
7. Products aimed at decarbonising the 
economy
In 2024, Telefónica continued strengthening its portfolio 
of digital products and services that help with the 
decarbonisation of other sectors of the economy, 
fostering the digital and green14 transitions as twin 
transitions. These initiatives not only constitute one of 
the Company's main strategies for mitigating climate 
change beyond its value chain, but they are also a key 
strategic opportunity for the Group (E1_OP02). They 
provide Telefónica with access to a growing market, in 
which there is rising demand for technological solutions 
capable of decarbonising customers’ productive 
processes, helping them to face greater regulatory 
pressure and increasing environmental consciousness.
They also directly contribute to one of the main targets 
of the Global Environmental and Energy Policy, 
specifically, to promoting digital solutions that help 
Telefónica's customers tackle the major environmental 
challenges that affect society as a whole.
The Exponential Roadmap initiative15 highlights that 
digital technologies could reduce greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions by 15% in the industrial sector, and by 
up to 35% if people’s habits change to become more 
digital and sustainable. This underlines the role of 
digitalisation in the transition to a low-carbon economy 
and strengthens the Company's commitment to 
solutions that benefit both the environment and its 
customers’ competitiveness.
This action is in continuous development given its 
essential nature within the Company’s strategy and is 
implemented through the following activities:
Development of Eco Smart services
Telefónica develops services based on connectivity, 
Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, big data and 5G. These 
solutions have the potential to provide not only 
operational and cost-saving benefits, but environmental 
benefits as well. To identify them, the Company uses the 
Eco Smart seal. The label has four icons that represent 
energy savings, reduction of water consumption, 
reduction of CO2e emissions and promotion of the 
circular economy. Below are examples relating to the 
decarbonisation potential of some of these solutions: :
• Energy savings: services that, for example, optimise 
logistics routes or vehicle fleets or allow the energy 
consumption of facilities to be monitored and 
managed. 
• Reduction in CO2e emissions: services that, for 
example, improve traffic planning in cities or the 
maintenance of air conditioning equipment, avoiding 
refrigerant gas leaks. 
In 2024 the Group continued to develop green digital 
solutions and identify them with the Eco Smart seal. At 
the end of the year, AENOR analysed the B2B solutions 
portfolios for Telefónica Argentina, Telefónica Brazil, 
Telefónica Chile, Telefónica Colombia, Telefónica 
Ecuador, Telefónica Germany, Telefónica Global 
Solutions (TGS), Telefónica Mexico, Telefónica Peru, 
Telefónica Spain, Telefónica Tech, Telefónica Uruguay 
and Telefónica Venezuela.
As a result of the verification process of the B2B 
solutions portfolios, 57% of the services offered in these 
entities have been verified as Eco Smart due to their 
potential for delivering environmental benefits and 
contributing to mitigating the customers’ impact on the 
planet16.
Eco Smart services meet the following criteria: the 
environmental benefit must occur in the customer's 
production activity/process or in the users of a service 
provided by that customer, it must be a direct 
consequence and not a secondary effect derived from 
the main benefit, and it must be significant.
Avoided emissions quantification
To ascertain the level of Telefónica's contribution to 
mitigating climate change, the Company annually 
quantifies the GHG emissions avoided by its customers 
thanks to their use of Telefónica products and services, 
that is, the net carbon impact generated compared to a 
reference scenario in which that solution is not used.
This scenario is defined based on well-documented 
external references and should reflect the most likely 
alternative scenario, considering the same functional 
unit and the same technical specifications. 
Telefónica estimates that its Eco Smart and connectivity 
services helped customers avoid the emission of 17.4 
million tonnes of CO2e in 2024. It is important to clarify 
that these emissions do not contribute to reducing the 
Telefónica Group's carbon footprint.
The calculation of this indicator used a methodology 
based on the WBCSD "Guidance on Avoided Emissions"

16 This indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of B2B solutions verified as Eco Smart by AENOR by the total number of B2B solutions in the 
Company's portfolio. AENOR evaluates the P&S portfolio based on the ISO/IEC17029:2019 standard Conformity assessment – General principles and 
requirements for validation and verification bodies.

and the ITU standard “L.1480: Enabling the Net Zero 
transition: Assessing how the use of information and 
communication technology solutions impact 
greenhouse gas emissions of other sectors".
The contribution of the connectivity services offered to 
the residential segment (B2C) in Spain, Germany and 
Brazil has been quantified, as well as some IoT-based 
Eco Smart services offered to business customers (B2B) 
in these markets, given that currently only these have 
the complete information required by these standards. 
Every year, the Company works to include a greater 
number of Eco Smart services.
Specifically, in terms of connectivity services in the B2C 
segment, fixed and mobile broadband services are 
considered, including the following uses: teleworking, 
online learning, online shopping, public transport 
applications and carpooling applications. The IoT 
solutions incorporated are those related to the 
management of smart cities (lighting, waste and parking) 
and vehicle fleets management.
For each of the solutions analysed, the following types of 
effects have been identified and, where possible, 
quantified: 
• First-order effects: direct environmental impacts 
associated with the physical existence of the solution 
and its components, i.e. all stages of its life cycle (LCA). 
For example, the impact of Narrowband access, the 
SIM card and the sensor in an IoT solution. 
• Second-order effects: indirect impacts generated by 
the use and application of the solution, which could be 
positive or negative. For example, the emission savings 
associated with the journeys avoided by a person who 
teleworks using a connectivity service or the emissions 
generated by the increase in energy consumption at 
home.
• Higher-order effects: indirect impacts other than first- 
and second-order effects that occur through changes 
in consumption patterns or lifestyles in society in the 
medium and long term. These can also be positive or 
negative. For example, emission savings associated 
with the consolidation of offices due to the medium- 
or long-term adoption of teleworking. 
The calculation of the net carbon impact for each 
solution is obtained from the sum of the effects 
described above:
Net carbon impact = ∑ First-order effects + ∑ Second-
order effects + ∑ Higher-order effects 
The total emissions avoided are therefore obtained by 
adding up the net carbon impacts of all the solutions 
analysed.
The calculations related to the B2C connectivity 
solutions, which represent close to 99% of the total data 
on avoided emissions, are explained below.
For all of them, the first-order effects considered are the 
CO2e emissions generated by the provision of each 
access (fixed and/or mobile). 
Second-order and higher-order effects may differ from 
one use to another and are determined based on 
primary data (results of surveys of Telefónica customers) 
and secondary data (bibliographic sources). For 
example, in the case of teleworking and online learning, 
two second-order effects are identified:
• Commuting avoided. The surveys provide the 
percentage of adoption of these habits, the average 
number of days a week that the customer teleworks or 
learns online, or the average distance and type of 
transport avoided by not having to travel to their place 
of work or study. This makes it possible to calculate 
the emissions saved by the commuting avoided.
• Additional energy consumption at home. Emissions are 
calculated using information from surveys and 
bibliographic sources. 
The higher-order effect identified is the consolidation of 
offices and study centres. Avoided emissions, where 
applicable, are calculated from bibliographic sources.
This example also demonstrates the consideration given 
to the calculation of possible adverse or rebound effects.
Resources allocated to adaptation and 
mitigation actions

The significant current and future financial resources, 
both OpEx and CapEx, allocated to the actions 
contained in the Climate Action Plan described in the 
previous section, are detailed below, including their 
relation to the financial statements and the Taxonomy 
indicators.
Network transformation and renewable energy
In 2024 Telefónica invested 2,444 million euros in the 
transformation and modernisation of the 
telecommunications networks based on high-speed 
fixed and mobile networks, including supporting 
infrastructures and software that improved their energy 
efficiency. This investment is part of the Company's 
global CapEx (investment in intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment) (see breakdown of 
CapEx by segments in Note 4 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements).
Furthermore, as of 31 December 2024, Telefónica had 
renewable energy purchase commitments (PPAs) 
amounting to 1,033 million euros, mainly of Telefónica 
Spain for the period from 2025 to 2031 and Telefónica

Financial effects of climate-related risks and 
opportunities
Financing linked to sustainability criteria
Telefónica’s ability to implement its climate change-
related strategic actions depends to a large extent on 
the availability and allocation of financial resources.
Sustainable financing is an element for the 
transformation of the business model. Access to capital 
with sustainability criteria, through green bonds and 
hybrid instruments, supports the implementation of 
projects with a positive environmental and/or social 
impact, such as deployment of fibre optics or 5G.
In 2024, Telefónica maintained an active presence in the 
capital market with several issuances throughout the 
year raising a total of 3,050 million euros of debt in green 
format. These transactions are supported by a 
Sustainable Financing Framework, last updated in July 
2023.
In terms of bank financing, Telefónica has financing 
linked to sustainability KPIs. At the end of the year, the 
Company met the objectives committed to financial 
entities.

Overall, as of 31 December 2024, the Group's sustainable 
financing amounted to 21,447 million euros. This 
financing includes current and non-current financial 
liabilities amounting to 4,804 million euros, hybrid 
instruments amounting to 6,050 million euros, and 
undrawn committed credit lines amounting to 10,593 
million euros (see Note 29.d of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements).
Extreme climate-related events
In 2024, two extreme weather events in Spain and Brazil 
affected the Company, as described under section '5. 
Business continuity plans'. The preliminary damage 
estimate, calculated by the local business units at the 
date of preparation of this Report, amounted to 97 
million euros. This is the initial estimate calculated by the 
respective business units to begin to handle the claims 
with the insurance entities and their appraisers. 
Therefore, the final amount payable will be adjusted as 
the assessments and repairs to damaged assets are 
completed. The actual financial impact on Telefónica will 
be mitigated thanks to the Group’s insurance programs 
and coverage for climate-related events. 
Data-driven solutions for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions reductions
The Telefónica Group recorded 782 million euros in 
revenues in 2024 corresponding to the activity defined 
in the European Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities 8.2 
Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reduction (see 
chapter 2.8).

E1.MDR-T_01-13
Telefónica has defined a series of targets linked to 
adaptation to and mitigation of climate change, aligned 
with the core corporate commitments of its Global 
Environmental and Energy Policy and its Supply Chain 
Sustainability Policy.
These targets are part of the Climate Action Plan:
Net zero emissions target by 2040
Target: achieve net zero carbon emissions, which 
consists of reducing all the emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) 
by at least 90% by 2040 compared to the base year and 
neutralising unabated emissions through high-quality 
carbon credits and, as far as possible, through nature-
based solutions.
Interim targets
With the goal of progressing towards achieving the 
target by 2040, interim targets have been defined:
• Reduce operational emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 90% 
globally by 2030, bringing it forward to 2025 for the 
Company’s main markets. All this with respect to 2015 
(base year) and taking into account the entire scope of 
the Telefónica Group, including investees which are 
consolidated on a proportional basis.

• Reduce emissions in Telefónica's value chain (Scope 
3) by 56% by 2030, compared to 2016 (base year).
• Continue to use 100% renewable electricity in 
Telefónica Germany, Telefónica Brazil, Telefónica 
Spain, Telefónica Chile and Telefónica Peru, and 
achieve this throughout the Company's operations by 
2030.
• In its main markets, Telefónica is committed to 
supporting activities that mitigate climate change in 
an equivalent amount to its operational emissions 
(Scopes 1 and 2) as from 2025.
• Reduce energy consumption per unit of traffic (MWh/
PB) by 95% by 2030 compared to 2015.
At the methodological, assumptions, limitations, sources 
or processes level, no updates were made to the targets 
in the reporting year.
The GHG emissions reduction targets are absolute 
targets, which means that they do not include offsetting 
through carbon sequestration, carbon credits or avoided 
emissions. This reinforces the commitment to achieving 
direct and effective reductions in the Group’s emissions, 
in line with the inventory boundaries and the goal of 
achieving net zero carbon emissions at the Company.
Through these targets, Telefónica aims to ensure 
continuous monitoring of the effectiveness of its policies 
and actions. The performance indicators are reviewed 
quarterly and annually to adapt the actions and become 
more ambitious, if necessary. Results are also audited on 
an independent basis by a third party.
E1-4_22
Science-based targets
Telefónica’s emissions reduction targets were defined 
through the Absolute Contraction Approach method. 
The method takes into account absolute reductions 
based on global decarbonisation pathways, according to 
the SBTi's Corporate Net-Zero Standard in line with the 
1.5°C scenario of the Paris Agreement.
 E1-4_20, E1-4_21
Base years selected
Telefónica selected its base years, 2015 (Scopes 1 and 2) 
and 2016 (Scope 3), taking into account the 
improvements in methodology, the availability and 
traceability of the data, and the accuracy of the 
calculations, ensuring that they are verifiable. Therefore, 
the base years chosen are considered representative in 
terms of the Group’s typical GHG profile. The activities 
that Telefónica currently engages in relate to those 
which were carried out during the base years. In 
addition, in those years, there were no internal 
operational changes or external circumstances that 
caused anomalies in the GHG inventories of 2015 and 
2016. Therefore, the base years used to define the 
emissions reduction targets were not amended during 
the reporting year.

Process to set targets and their evolution
The GHG emissions reduction targets set by the Group 
seek to ensure proper management of the climate-
related material IROs identified. These targets were 
defined by Telefónica’s technical teams.
To define them, the actions planned by the Company 
such as renewable energy purchasing, energy efficiency 
and its suppliers program were taken into account. 
Additionally, the Group’s commitment to achieving net 
zero emissions was considered in line with international 
commitments and best practices set in initiatives such 
as RE100 and CDP. The SBTi’s Corporate Net-Zero 
Standard (version 1.0 of October 2021), compatible with 
limiting global warming to 1.5ºC, was also used in 
determining the targets.
Once they had been defined and validated at a technical 
level, they were approved by the Board of Directors. This 
therefore ensured that the targets were included in the 
Company’s global strategy.
The associated metrics were verified by an independent 
third party, AENOR - Spanish Association for 
Standardisation and Certification, except for the 
denominator associated with data traffic (PetaByte) 
related to the energy consumption reduction metric, 
which has been audited as part of the Sustainability 
Report.
The approved targets are given below, as well as their 
performance.

Telefónica continues to make progress towards its net 
zero emissions target. In 2024, it achieved a reduction of 
84.8% in Scopes 1 and 2 emissions and a reduction of 
31.3% in Scope 3 emissions. This progress is primarily the 
result of implementing decarbonisation levers, such as 
energy consumption (including the Renewable Energy 
Plan and energy efficiency projects), working with 
suppliers and circular economy initiatives. For more 
details on the emissions inventory, see the GHG 
emissions by Scope and estimated future emissions 
table in section 2.9.4.3. GHG emissions.

2.9.4.2. Energy
Energy is an essential resource for the Company’s 
operations. In 2024, over 95% of Telefónica’s energy 
consumption came from the telecommunications 
network. This is why, for Telefónica, keeping energy 
consumption stable is a priority, despite the considerable 
rise in digitalisation in society and therefore the data 
traffic passing through the Group’s networks.

2.9.4.3. GHG emissions
GHG emissions inventory
E1-6_15
Telefónica calculates the carbon footprint for its 
operations (Scopes 1 and 2) and its value chain (Scope 
3), using the methodology established in the GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(revised edition). The emissions inventory follows the 
methodological guidelines based on the principles of 
relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and 
accuracy.
The information contained in Telefónica’s GHG 
emissions inventory corresponds to the Company’s 
reporting scope for sustainability indicators.
Telefónica calculates and reports these emissions in 
terms of CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e), taking into account not 
only carbon dioxide (CO₂), but also other greenhouse 
gases such as methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O) and 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).
The Company calculates its GHG emissions by 
multiplying the activity data compiled at each facility or 
business unit by documented GHG emissions factors, 
which are regularly selected and updated at corporate 
level.
An explanation is provided below of the specific 
calculation methods, the significant assumptions and 
the sources of the activity data and emissions factors 
used to calculate the Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions, as 
well as the emissions from the significant categories in 
Scope 3.
Scope 1 emissions (direct GHG emissions): they 
come from two sources: fuel consumption (fleet and 
operations) and fugitive emissions of fluorinated gases. 
The emissions factors used are stated in the GHG 
Protocol Cross Sector Tools (2024), the IPCC Sixth 
Assessment Report (2021) and the carbon footprint 
reporting tools provided by the ministries of the different 
countries.
Scope 2 emissions (indirect GHG emissions): they 
come from two sources: electricity consumption and 
district heating. In the case of electricity, there are two 
methods for calculating these emissions, one that is 
location-based and one that is market-based. The 
emissions factors used for the location-based method 
come from the IEA Emissions Factors (2024) report from 
the International Energy Agency and from local official 
sources (energy or environment ministries) in each 
country. For the market-based method, the emissions 
factors used are the local sources available (for example, 
MITECO for Spain) or the electricity residual mix factors 
of the Association Issuing Bodies (AIB).
Scope 3 emissions (other indirect GHG emissions): 
Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions generated in 
Telefónica’s upstream and downstream value chain as a 
result of its operations, but which occur at sources that 
the Company neither owns nor controls.
Telefónica recognises the importance of Scope 3 
emissions as they represent 88% of its total GHG 
emissions.
E1-6_26, E1-6_27
In order to determine the most significant categories of 
indirect emissions for Telefónica, which are those 
offering the greatest opportunities for emissions 
reductions, in 2021 the Company performed an analysis 
of the 15 categories under the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Value Chain Accounting and Reporting Standard.
The analysis identified material categories as those 
which represented over 5% of the total Scope 3 
emissions, such as: 'Purchased goods and services', 
'Capital goods', 'Fuel- and energy-related activities' and 
'Use of sold products'. These categories represent the

greatest impact on Telefónica’s value chain and, 
therefore, are the priority categories in the reporting and 
emission management process. Although they do not 
exceed the 5% threshold, other Scope 3 emissions are 
also reported, as they are considered strategic for the 
business or relevant to improve comparability with the 
sector, such as 'Business travel' and 'Investments’ 
categories.
The remaining Scope 3 categories are excluded from 
Telefónica’s GHG inventory, either because they are not 
applicable, are reported in other scopes or because they 
represent less than 5% of the value chain’s emissions. 
These categories are therefore of less strategic 
significance in terms of triggering reduction levers to 
help achieve the net zero emissions target. The 
categories excluded from the GHG inventory do not 
exceed 10% of total Scope 3 emissions. This follows the 
recommendations of the GHG Protocol and meets the 
criteria of the Net Zero corporate standard of the SBTi 
initiative.
E1-6_29
The methodology used for Scope 3 emissions 
accounting complies with the recommendations from 
the GHG Protocol (Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) 
Accounting and Reporting Standard) and from the 
sectoral guidance provided by ITU-T, GeSI and GSMA 
(Guidance for Assessment of Scope 3 Emissions for 
Operators).
• To calculate the emissions of purchased goods and 
services and capital goods (cat. 1 and 2), the hybrid 
method defined by the GHG Protocol is used, in which 
the supplier's emissions intensity is multiplied by the 
amount spent on the supplier. This uses the amounts 
spent in the reporting year for purchases included 
within Telefónica’s Procurement Management Model, 
for each supplier and purchase type. Each supplier's 
emissions intensity is calculated based on the GHG 
emissions of that supplier and their revenues, using 
the supplier’s emissions information or taking into 
account the type of purchase.
In the case of purchased mobile devices, the supplier-
specific method is used, according to which the units 
of purchased devices are multiplied by the specific 
emissions of the manufacture and transportation life 
stages included in the Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) of each 
model.
• The emissions associated with energy-related 
activities (cat. 3) are those associated with extraction 
and production of the energy consumed, as well as 
transmission and distribution losses of electricity and 
district heating. The calculation methodology is based 
on the activity data (amount of fuel, electricity and 
district heating used in the reporting year by the 
different business units) and the upstream emissions 
factors and transmission and distribution losses 
factors, which are specific to each country and are 
obtained from the International Energy Agency’s Life 
Cycle Upstream Emissions Factors (2024) report and 
the "2024 UK Government GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting" report from the UK’s 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA).
• For calculating business travel emissions (cat. 6), both 
the distance-based method (for distances travelled by 
plane, train, bus, rental car and boat) and the spend-
based method (for journeys in certain modes of 
transport where the mileage is not known) are used. 
The sources of emissions factors used are the "2024 
UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for 
Company Reporting" report from the UK’s Department 
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and 
the Air Emission Accounts by area of activity and 
economic aggregated data by area of activity 
(Cuentas de emisiones a la atmósfera por ramas de 
actividad y Agregados por ramas de actividad) from 
Spain’s INE (the National Statistics Institute).
• Two approaches are used to calculate emissions from 
the use of sold products (cat. 11):
1. Emissions from the use of mobile devices 
(smartphones or tablets) are calculated by 
multiplying the number of sold mobile devices by 
the use life stage specific LCA product emissions of 
each device. The sources of the emissions data are 
publicly available LCA studies from suppliers or 
data from the Eco Rating initiative.
2.Emissions from the use of customer-premises 
equipment, such as routers and set-top boxes, are 
calculated by multiplying the number of devices 
installed by the annual energy consumption and 
the specific electricity emission factor of each 
country. The sources of the electricity emissions 
factors are the same as the ones used for the 
location-based method when calculating Scope 2 
emissions.
• Although they are not included in the target, the 
emissions associated with investments (cat. 15) have 
also been calculated since the creation in 2021 of the 
VMO2 joint venture in the United Kingdom. This 
category includes emissions from the investees over 
which Telefónica has no operational control. To ensure 
the representativeness of these, the economic data 
associated with their operations are analysed so that 
the investees which are excluded do not represent in 
any case more than 5% of these indicators on an 
aggregate basis. For calculating category 15 emissions, 
the investment-specific method is used, multiplying 
the operational emissions of the investee company by 
Telefónica’s share of equity. If no public emissions data 
are available, the average-data method is used, 
multiplying the revenue of the investee company by an

EEIO (Environmentally-Extended Input-Output) factor 
that is representative of the sector of economic 
activity of the investee company and by Telefónica’s 
share of equity in the investee company. This factor is 
drawn from the Air Emission Accounts by area of 
activity and economic aggregated data by area of 
activity from Spain’s INE (the National Statistics 
Institute).

In accordance with the best practices established in the 
GHG Protocol and SBTi standards, whenever there is a 
methodological change or a significant change in the 
activities in the GHG inventories that represents a 5% 
change of the total Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, the 
historic data is recalculated, including the base year. In 
this way, the representativeness of the base years used 
to monitor progress in Telefónica's GHG emissions is 
fostered.

In 2024, the Telefónica Group emitted 2.2 tCO2e, the 
largest proportion of which came from the indirect 
emissions produced in the value chain (Scope 3), which 
accounted for 88% of the Company’s carbon footprint.
Indirect emissions from electricity use (Scope 2) 
represented 7% of total emissions, while direct emissions 
from the activities controlled by Telefónica (Scope 1) 
amounted to 5%.

GHG emissions (tCO2e)
In 2024, Scope 1 emissions were slightly higher than the 
previous year (0.3%).
However, Scope 2 emissions dropped by 29% compared 
to the previous year. This was achieved through the 
energy efficiency and renewable energy plans. 
Consumption of renewable energy reached 89%.
Compared to the base year (2015), Scope 1 emissions 
decreased by 57% and Scope 2 emissions by 90%. 
Combined, Scopes 1 and 2 emissions fell by 84.8%, 
resulting in 1,535,954 tCO2e fewer emitted to the 
atmosphere.
88% of the Group’s total emissions were Scope 3 
emissions, that is, indirect emissions produced by 
Telefónica's value chain.
Of these emissions, 65% came from purchases made in 
the supply chain ('Category 1. Purchased goods and 
services' and 'Category 2. Capital goods') and 28% from 
the use of products sold to customers ('Category 11. Use 
of sold products').
Other relevant categories included were 'Category 3. 
Energy consumption-related activities' and 'Category 6. 
Business travel', which together accounted for the 
remaining 7% of the value chain’s emissions.
Telefónica also calculates other emissions that it 
considers strategic to its business such as 'Category 15. 
Investments', which in 2024 amounted to 28,441 tCO2e. 
This category included emissions from VMO2, the joint 
venture created in the UK in 2021, and the fixed and 
mobile network sharing companies, among others.
In 2024, Scope 3 emissions decreased by 31.3% 
compared to 2016 (base year) and by 0.4% compared to 
the previous year.
Despite this reduction, Scope 3 emissions increased in 
certain significant categories.
Specifically, the emissions associated with purchases 
rose by 4% compared to 2023, due both to the increase 
in counted procurement volume and to the increase of 
new products, such as televisions, household appliances 
and games consoles in the Telefónica Group’s sales 
portfolio.
Notwithstanding the increase in these new products, the 
'use of sold products' category decreased by 4% 
compared to 2023, due to the greater efficiency of 
customer-premises equipment (emissions from set-top 
boxes and routers were reduced by 15% compared to 
the previous year).
Business travel emissions increased by 21% due to the 
return to in-person meetings, although they remained  
38% lower than the pre-pandemic level.

During the reporting year, the percentage of Scope 3 
emissions calculated using primary data was 72%.

Carbon credits
E1-7_20
Telefónica's net zero emissions target is based on the 
definition included in the SBTi’s Corporate Net-Zero 
Standard. It seeks to reduce carbon emissions in line with 
the 1.5ºC scenario of the Paris Agreement and neutralise 
unabated emissions through the sequestration of CO2 from 
the atmosphere (with a maximum of 10%).
Following these premises, emissions that cannot be 
reduced (a maximum of 10% by 2040) will be neutralised 
through the cancellation of carbon credits. Before 2040, 
activities outside Telefónica's value chain that help to 
mitigate climate change (BVCM, or Beyond Value Chain 
Mitigation) will be supported, in both projects that 
generate GHG reduction credits and GHG emission 
removal credits.
E1-7_12
To this end, high-quality credits procured on the 
Voluntary Carbon Market are used. The projects that 
generate those carbon credits must meet the following 
quality criteria:
• Carbon sequestration projects should preferably be 
nature-based, such as reforestation, afforestation or 
ecosystem restoration (forests, wetlands, grasslands, 
oceans), using native plant species.
• Projects should be able to demonstrate additionality 
and long-term impact.
• Projects should provide environmental and social co-
benefits, contribute as much as possible to the 
achievement of the SDGs, and respect and consider 
the rights of local communities and indigenous 
peoples.
• Projects should be certified with recognised national/
international accreditation schemes and verified by an 
independent accredited third party.
• Projects should preferably be located in countries in 
which Telefónica is present, especially in those with 
high levels of deforestation, such as Brazil, Peru and 
Colombia. It thereby contributes to halting 
deforestation in these regions, supporting the 
conservation of existing forest carbon reserves and 
providing incentives to support indigenous peoples 
and local communities.
E1-7_10, E1-7_15
Since 2019, Telefónica has financed climate change 
mitigation measures outside its value chain through the 
purchase of carbon credits of nature-based projects. In 
2024, 37,655 tCO2e of carbon credits were cancelled, 
with 100% of the projects used being biogenic sinks.
E1-7_13, E1-7_14, E1-7_16, E1-7_17
In 2024, 68% of the cancelled carbon credits came from 
emissions reduction projects (REDD+), while the 
remaining projects were carbon removal projects (ARR) 
involving biogenic sinks.
The following table shows the breakdown of the GHG 
mitigation projects outside the value chain that were 
financed through carbon credits.

Telefónica Spain has the credits from the Telefónica 
Forest, in Palencia, through which it helps to restore a 
degraded agricultural area, transforming it into forest 
use, and from another project that restores an area 
affected by a forest fire in Caldas de Reis, Galicia, with 
native species. Credits have also been cancelled from a 
project preventing unplanned deforestation and 
degradation of an indigenous reservation situated to the 
east of the Colombian region of the Orinoco highlands, 
in the transitional belt between the savannas of the 
Orinoco and the Amazonian forests. Thanks to these 
three projects, the operator offset 28% of its operational 
emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) in 2024.
Meanwhile, Telefónica Brazil continued to offset 100% of 
its Scopes 1 and 2 emissions through the purchase of 
carbon credits. The projects support local initiatives for 
both the conservation of ecosystems that prevent 
deforestation in the regions of Rondônia and Amapá and 
for the reforestation of the Amazon forest with native 
species. They also foster the social and economic 
development of local communities by generating 
income and developing educational activities.

23 The data relating to carbon credits cancelled in 2024 have been verified by an independent third party.

Telefónica Germany cancelled credits from a 
reforestation project in Colombia that promotes the 
sustainable management of forest resources to foster 
natural regeneration, for a quantity equivalent to 80% of 
its operational emissions.
Lastly, Telefónica, S.A. mitigated 75% of the impact of 
the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from its corporate 
premises by removing an equivalent amount of CO2 from 
the atmosphere. This was achieved through a 
reforestation project based in Colombia and another 
restoration program involving hillside woodland 
containing chestnut, oak and pine trees in San Esteban 
de Budiño, in Spain.
E1-7_11, E1-7_19
One of the targets set for 2025 is to offset the Group’s 
Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in its main markets (Spain, 
Germany and Brazil). In 2024, Telefónica offset 72% for 
its main markets and 14% globally. Meeting this interim 
target will mean cancelling 295,000 carbon credits 
between 2025 and 2030, according to the Company’s 
forecast operational emissions. In the medium term, 
there are agreements that ensure the availability of 
credits, thanks to a multi-country and multi-annual 
purchase that was awarded in 2022.

2.9.4.4. Internal carbon pricing
E1-8_01, E1-8_02, E1-8_13
The setting of internal carbon price is one of the most 
efficient tools to internalise the costs arising from GHG 
emissions.
Telefónica has an internal carbon price (shadow price) 
that helps to guide the purchase of equipment towards 
low-carbon options. When procuring equipment that 
uses energy (electricity and/or fuel), as well as 
equipment containing fluorinated gases, this shadow 
price is incorporated in the calculation of the Total Cost 
of Ownership (TCO). This makes it possible to consider 
not just the equipment’s purchase price but also the 
price of the energy used and the price of the emissions 
generated during its lifetime. This makes it possible to 
select more efficient equipment that will produce fewer 
operational emissions over its useful lifetime.
The price will have an effect on reducing Scopes 1 and 2 
emissions. As these are future emissions at asset level, 
the quantification of emissions for the year in progress is 
not deemed relevant, in comparison to the emissions of 
the useful lifetime of the asset covered by this 
mechanism.
E1-8_03
The application of the shadow price is defined in the 
Corporate Low Carbon Procurement Instruction, which 
specifies the product categories to which it applies, 
provided that they exceed a certain amount. Shadow 
pricing is applied to these procurement processes of the 
Telefónica Group’s companies in all the regions in which 
it operates.
E1-8_04, E1-8_05
In order to define this value, a literature review of carbon 
prices and trends was carried out. In this process, the 
carbon price projections of the International Energy 
Agency (IEA), emissions allowances prices of the 
European Union (EUA), as well as trends identified by the 
Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition were analysed. The 
sources examined showed prices ranging between USD 
50/tCO2e and USD 100/tCO2e.
Subsequently, a comparison of the average prices 
disclosed in the CDP’s climate change questionnaire 
was performed, identifying that the average internal 
shadow carbon price of companies was USD28/tCO2e. 
As part of the analysis, and with the aim of taking real 
carbon prices into account, the Group's experience in 
terms of carbon credit purchasing was incorporated. For 
this purpose, Telefónica performed an assessment of the 
prices of carbon credits procured on the Voluntary 
Carbon Market (VCM) between 2020 and 2022 and the 
price ranges of Telefónica’s carbon credit purchase 
agreements up until 2026.
Considering the trends analysed, internal experience 
and the prediction of future prices of the VCM, it was 
decided to set the internal carbon price at 30 €/tCO2e.

the chapter: 
 2.3. Materiality
In addition, to assess specific impacts, risks and 
opportunities, during the analysis and implementation 
sessions of Telefónica's digital waste management tool 
(GreTel), the Company:
• Identified those of its assets and activities with the 
potential to generate waste.
• Considered each country's environmental regulations. 
Finally, the waste data collected by the GReTel system 
at the Company's operators with telecommunications 
infrastructure were also used as a reference.
E5.IRO-1_02
All the required information about the consultations held 
with the different stakeholders, including affected 
groups, is gathered and reported in the following

Global Environmental and Energy Policy
E5-1_01, E5-1_02
Telefónica is committed to protecting the environment 
by reducing its environmental footprint. This policy 
includes the following fundamental principles:
• Responsible network deployment and operation.
• Pollution prevention.
• Efficient use of resources and the circular economy.
Furthermore, this policy aims to maximise the 
opportunities offered by the circular economy through:
• Collaborating with suppliers to implement eco-
efficiency measures in the supply of equipment and 
services.
• Reducing waste generation by reusing and recycling 
electronic equipment.
• Using digitalisation to improve the traceability and 
reverse logistics of equipment.

• Promoting digital services and products that 
contribute to solving global and local environmental 
challenges.
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy
E5-1_01
This policy establishes that suppliers must implement 
preventive measures to reduce the environmental 
impact arising from their activity. This encompasses the 
entire life cycle, from the extraction of raw materials, 
manufacturing and transportation, to the management 
of waste and its final destination. 
Suppliers must ensure, to the extent possible and in the 
context of their contractual relationship with the 
Company, that they reduce the environmental impact of 
their products and services by facilitating the integration 
of eco-efficiency practices, such as: 
• Energy efficiency.
• Incorporating less polluting materials or recycled 
materials.
• Enabling and encouraging the reusability, repairability 
and durability of their products.
E5-1_02
The policy also establishes that suppliers must commit 
to applying eco-efficiency criteria when conducting their 
activity with Telefónica, especially when dealing with 
scarce resources such as water. Furthermore, they must 
reduce emissions of polluting gases into the atmosphere 
to the bare minimum.
It also promotes a reduction in the amount of single-use 
plastics found in products supplied to Telefónica and 
favours their removal from any supply of Telefónica-
branded products (Movistar, Vivo, O2).

2.10.1.2. Action plans
E5.MDR-A_01-12
Telefónica has implemented actions to achieve the goals 
of becoming a Zero Waste company by 2030 and 
meeting the circular economy commitments outlined in 
its Global Environmental and Energy Policy. These 
involve minimising the impact of the waste generated, 
promoting reuse and recycling, and reducing the 
generation of hazardous waste. 
These are the main actions that Telefónica is working on 
in order to manage the negative impacts (E5_IN01), 
material risks (E5_RI01, E5_RI02, E5_RI03 and E5_RI04) and 
opportunities (E5_OP01, E5_OP02 and E5_OP03) related to the 
circular economy:
1. Reuse customer-premises equipment.
2.Reuse mobile devices.
3.Prioritise the reuse of network equipment.
4.Recycle 100% of waste when reuse is not possible.
1. Reuse customer-premises equipment (routers 
and set-top boxes) 
This action focuses on the reuse of B2C/B2B routers and 
set-top boxes that follow a device as a service-model. It 
includes equipment that the Company collects from 
customers and delivers to a refurbishing company to 
give a second life. The scope of the initiative also 
includes the digitalisation of reverse logistics processes 
and the use of blockchain technology to increase device 
reuse rates, such as the VICKY initiative.
This project is being rolled out to all Telefónica operators 
offering fixed telecommunications services: Spain, Brazil, 
Germany, Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru. The 
stages of the value chain involved are: procurement 
(goods for business development), operations 
(equipment installation) and after-sales (reverse 
logistics, technical support and repair). 
Reusing equipment helps to reduce dependency risks 
related to the circular economy (E5_RI01, E5_RI02) while also 
representing an opportunity to make financial savings by 
avoiding the purchase of new equipment (E5_OP01).
The expected outcome of this action is the reuse of 90% 
of the routers and set-top boxes delivered for 
refurbishment by the end of 2024, meaning it is a short-
term action.
In 2024, the Company reused more than 4 million routers 
and set-top boxes, amounting to 91.4% of all equipment 
delivered to be refurbished.
2. Reuse mobile devices
The scope of this initiative covers giving customer- or 
Telefónica-owned mobile devices obtained through 
various channels a second life, whether through 
buyback programs, the sale of refurbished devices, 
repair services, reuse within leasing services or the 
MARA program, among other actions. 
This initiative is being rolled out in the markets in which 
Telefónica offers mobile phone services, such as 
Germany, Spain, Brazil and Hispanoamerica. The 
different stages of the value chain involved are 
procurement, products and services, and after-sales 
(reverse logistics, technical support and repair).
Reusing devices contributes to the reduction of circular 
economy-related dependency risks (E5_RI01 and E5_RI02). 
These are long-term actions that are expected to deliver 
the reuse of over 500,000 mobile phones by 2030. In 
2024, 437,180 mobile devices were reused.

3. Prioritise the reuse of network equipment 
Telefónica has implemented programs and platforms 
(E5_OP02) to extend the lifespan and reuse of second-
hand network equipment (for example, the MAIA 
marketplace).
This equipment comes from its infrastructure and 
partner companies, mainly in markets with 
telecommunication networks such as Spain, Brazil and 
Hispanoamerica.
The stages of the value chain involved are procurement 
(goods for business development), operations 
(installation of network, customer and data centre 
infrastructure) and marketing (logistics and distribution).
The reuse of network equipment is a long-term action  
that will contribute to the reduction of circular economy-
related dependency risks (E5_RI01 and E5_RI02). 
In 2024, 533,818 items of network equipment were 
reused, a larger figure than the expected result of 
maintaining similar reuse figures to the previous year. 
This was due to a greater reuse of equipment among 
Group operators.
4. Recycle 100% of waste when reuse is not 
possible
This initiative includes delivering waste for recycling to 
waste managers authorised by the competent bodies 
and consolidating the waste generated by the 
Company’s activity. In some cases it is possible to 
generate income through the sale of waste for recycling 
(E5_OP03).
The GreTel digital tool enhances the traceability of 
waste disposal information, helping to mitigate risks 
(E5_RI03 and E5_RI04) and impacts from improper treatment 
(E5_IN01).
The project, implemented across all regions with fixed or 
mobile telecommunications infrastructure, focuses on 
the operations stage (waste management from the 
business activities) of the value chain. 
This is a long-term action that is expected to recycle 
over 95% of the waste generated. In 2024, 94% of waste 
was recycled.
Corrective measures
In relation to corrective measures, no actual material 
impacts have been identified and it is therefore not 
appropriate to disclose this information. Thanks to the 
implementation of ISO 14001-standard Environmental 
Management Systems (EMS) across all Group operators, 
the necessary measures are in place to control impacts 
and safeguard individuals. Operating under a certified 
EMS ensures adequate control and compliance with the 
applicable environmental legislation at each of the 
Company's operators.
The EMS are therefore directly linked to the preventive 
environmental compliance model, which forms part of 
the Company’s global compliance process. 
Resources allocated to circular economy 
actions
In line with what is reported in chapter 2.8. European 
Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities
• Telefónica invested 612 million euros in fixed assets 
(CapEx) corresponding to the activity defined in the 
Taxonomy 5.5. Purchase of the equipment necessary 
for the provision of connectivity and television 
services. Part of this investment is included in the 
Network Transformation CapEx reported in chapter 
2.9. ESRS E1 - Climate Change.
• In addition, the Group invested 27 million euros in 
operational expenses (OpEx) allocated to activity 5.1. 
Refurbish, repair, and maintenance of fixed equipment 
and mobile terminals, as defined in the Taxonomy.
SBM-3_08
Financial effects of circular economy risks and 
opportunities
Regarding circular economy opportunities, as reported 
in activity 5.4. Sale of second-hand mobile devices in the 
Taxonomy chapter, the Group recorded revenues of 46 
million euros in 2024.

2.10.2. Metrics and targets
E5-3
2.10.2.1. Targets related to the management 
of material IROs
E5.MDR-T_01-13
Zero Waste
Target: reuse and recycle 100% of the total waste 
generated by 2030.
Performance in 2024: 95% of the waste generated was 
reused and recycled.
Telefónica has set itself the principal target of being a 
Zero Waste company by 2030. This is a quantifiable and 
relative target that covers all the material impacts, risks 
and opportunities related to the circular economy.
The target is aligned with the core commitments of the 
Company's Global Environmental and Energy Policy: the 
efficient use of resources and the circular economy to 
minimise the impact of waste, promoting reuse and 
recycling, and reducing the hazardous waste generated.
Scope
The scope of this target includes the hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste generated as part of the 
Company’s operations and delivered for recycling to 
managers authorised by the competent bodies.
At a geographic level, the scope is regional as it 
incorporates all the companies with fixed or mobile 
telecommunications infrastructure.
The stages of the value chain involved are the 
operations stage, in terms of the management of waste 
form the activity, and downstream value chain in after-
sales services such as reverse logistics for devices or 
handling customers’ electronic waste.
Methodologies
There are currently no common Zero Waste criteria, 
standards or methodologies that can be used as a 
benchmark in order to set targets based on conclusive 
scientific evidence.
Therefore, to define the target, reference was made to 
the definitions of Zero Waste formulated in GSMA 
strategic sectoral documents on the circular economy 
for network equipment and mobile devices. The target is 
also in alignment with the circular economy action plan 
and the European Union’s waste hierarchy concept, 
which establishes priorities and actions to protect the 
environment and boost the circular economy.
The waste hierarchy is found in the European Union’s 
Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) and in the 
European Commission’s categorisation system for the 
circular economy. As regards the suite of measures from 
the circular economy action plan proposed by the 
European Commission in 2022, this is in line with the 
European Union’s climate neutrality target for 2050 
under the European Green Deal.
No interim targets have been set. The target consists of 
a percentage calculated on the basis of the values for 
the year in progress, and therefore neither benchmark 
values nor year are applicable. Additionally, no changes 
have occurred regarding the target, the corresponding 
metrics or the measurement methodologies.
All the required information in relation to different 
stakeholder involvement in setting targets is specified in 
chapter 2.2 Strategy and business model, in the 
following section:
 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations
E5-3_01
Becoming a Zero Waste company by 2030 will facilitate 
the return of resources through reuse and recycling, 
ensuring that waste does not end up incinerated or sent 
to landfill but transformed into raw materials that are 
reintroduced into the value chain.
E5-3_02, E5-3_03
Reusing equipment and recycling materials enhances 
the use rates and circular design by facilitating the 
return of raw materials to production processes, allowing 
these materials to be available to manufacturers for use 
in new products.
E5-3_04, E5-3_05, E5-3_08
Reuse and recycling contribute to saving materials and 
sourcing renewable resources by reducing consumption 
and preventing the extraction of virgin raw materials, 
given that:
• Reusing equipment prevents the generation of waste 
and emissions by avoiding the purchase and 
manufacture of new products.
• Recycling forestalls the depletion of resources by 
transforming waste into raw material.
E5-3_06, E5-3_07, E5-3_09
The Zero Waste target seeks to transform waste into 
resources by managing it appropriately. The Company 
prioritises reuse and, when this is not possible, it draws 
value from the materials through recycling.
This contributes to the waste hierarchy levels of 
prevention, reuse and recycling by limiting the amount 
of waste destined for disposal.
Whenever waste is collected, the personnel responsible 
ensure that all the information is registered in the 
GReTel digital tool. This makes it possible to obtain and 
analyse real-time data on the origin and destination of 
the waste produced by the Company.

The system enables the personnel responsible to be 
aware of the volume of waste disposed, draft reports, 
analyse information and keep all documentary evidence 
relating to proper compliance with environmental 
regulations in each country. There can therefore be full 
traceability of the waste treatment.

Telefónica does not have production processes for 
manufacturing equipment and therefore does not 
directly consume materials. The main resource inflows 
come from the procurement of products that have 
already been manufactured, mainly electronic 
equipment, in particular:
• Customer-premises equipment, such as routers and 
set-top boxes.
• Mobile devices.
• Network equipment, such as antennas and other 
equipment associated with the telecommunications 
network infrastructure, including cables.
• Electronic office equipment.

3 The data on waste generated does not include reuse as reused equipment has not yet reached the end of its useful life.
4 Other treatment includes: physical, chemical and biological treatment, secure cells and intermediate treatment prior to recycling.

Thus, the waste generated mainly contains metals such 
as steel, aluminium, iron and copper and, to a lesser 
extent, materials from electronic elements such as 
ceramics, polymers, fibre glass and materials that make 
up the printed circuits.
In 2024, 59,233 tonnes of waste were generated, which 
included cables, batteries, paper and electronic waste. A 
total of 94% of this was recycled.  
Regarding the electronic equipment collected, 69% was 
reused, thus preventing it from becoming waste.

2.11. ESRS S1 - Own workforce
2.11.1. Strategy
Telefónica considers its team essential to developing its 
business strategy and driving growth. The Company 
aims to manage its team in a way that supports 
employee development and motivation by providing 
suitable working conditions and fostering an inclusive, 
safe and healthy work environment.
S1. ESRS 2 - SBM 2
Employee concerns and feedback
Employees are one of the Company’s key stakeholder 
groups, which is why Telefónica offers general and 
specific channels to gather employee feedback and 
address their concerns, while respecting and promoting 
their human rights. 
Employee expectations are incorporated into the 
Company's strategy and business model, as explained in 
the following section: 
 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations
In addition, to mitigate both actual and potential 
negative impacts related to human rights, employees 
have access to the Whistleblowing Channel and the 
Queries Channel, as explained in Due diligence phase 6:

section:
 2.3.2. Linking material impacts to the strategy and the 
business model
Types of employees
S1.SBM-3_01, S1.SBM-3_02
The double materiality analysis ascertained that the 
entire Telefónica workforce may be affected by the 
material IROs identified and is considered within the 
scope of disclosure. This includes Company employees 
with permanent, temporary and part-time contracts. 
The Company has its own personnel throughout the 
various stages of the value chain, from the research and 
development of new technologies and products to the 
installation of infrastructure, design of new products and 
services, marketing and after-sales. The Company also 
has its own employees in areas that facilitate all its 
activities, such as Finance, Procurement, Legal and 
People, among other areas. To ensure the functions are 
carried out, it relies on employees with differing 
backgrounds, training and experience, ranging from 
more technical to commercial and business 
management profiles. 
Non-employee workers are self-employed and 
temporary agency workers. Their hiring is based on 
specific business needs at particular times and is not 
restricted to a specific area or stage of the value chain.
S1.SBM-3_04
The Company prioritises working conditions through 
specific activities such as stable and quality employment 
programs and the active promotion of diversity and 
inclusion in terms of aspects such as gender, race, age, 
sexual orientation and origin. In parallel, Telefónica 
promotes social dialogue, freedom of association and 
collective bargaining to ensure that workers are 
effectively represented. 
It also fosters health and safety through the 
implementation of measures and campaigns to prevent 
workplace accidents and occupational illnesses and the 
delivery of training on physical and mental health. These 
initiatives improve employee well-being and contribute 
to the business’s long-term sustainability.
The Company prioritises a safe and violence-free 
workplace by focusing on preventing and addressing 
harassment. In particular, it has implemented a global 
procedure that facilitates confidential reporting and has 
specific protocols in place for handling these situations. 
It also offers awareness-raising courses. These actions 
are supervised by specialised committees in each 
country. 
Lastly, and as a central pillar of the People strategy, 
Telefónica is committed to the continuous learning of all 
its employees, facilitating the development of new skills 
within the workforce through a catalogue of training 
activities that include different types of in-person and 
online courses, certifications and access to e-learning 
platforms.
The employment relationship with non-employee 
workers is equivalent to that with workers in the value 
chain; therefore they are not considered to be affected 
by the IROs identified in the double materiality analysis.

The 2024 double materiality process also identified the 
material risks and opportunities arising from the impacts 
and dependencies of the Company’s workforce. These 
are presented in the material IROs table in the next 
section of this chapter.
S1.SBM-3_06, S1.SBM-3_07, S1.SBM-3_08, S1.SBM-3_09, S1.SBM-3_10
According to the double materiality analysis, no 
employees within the workforce are affected by the 
transition plans aimed at reducing negative 
environmental impacts. Neither are there any cases of 
child labour or forced labour within the Company’s 
operations. For more details on the outcome of the 
analysis, see:
 2.3.1.3. Result of the double materiality analysis
S1.SBM-3_11, S1.SBM-3_12
The main source of information used to identify risks in 
the double materiality process is Telefónica’s global risk 
management model (ERM).  
Based on the risk management (ERM) exercise, which 
the Company carries out regularly, an analysis is 
performed of the risks reported by the Group’s 
companies and their relationship with the topics of the 
European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). 
The result is shared with the global management areas, 
which use it to support the identification and 
assessment of their own risks in accordance with the 
CSRD. 
This model has enabled a detailed understanding of how 
certain groups of employees could be more affected by 
specific risks, such as the material risk related to safety, 
which affects specific regions where ongoing plans of 
action have been put in place. This is due to the specific 
security conditions in these countries and the 
characteristics of the operational activities conducted by 
this personnel, which include fieldwork and exposure to 
higher-risk areas (S1_RI01).

2.11.2.1. Policies 
S1.MDR-P_01-06, S1-1_01
Telefónica has a large number of internal policies and 
standards that address the management or resolution of 
material incidents, risks and opportunities related to all of 
its employees, without exception.
All the information required in the minimum disclosure 
requirements (MDR-P) about the policies adopted to 
manage sustainability issues is gathered and reported in 
the following section of the Sustainability notes:
 2.15. Policies
S1-1_03, S1-1_04
Global Human Rights Policy
Through this policy, which is based on the United 
Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) Guidelines and the core 
conventions of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), among others, the Company commits to 
respecting the human and labour rights of its employees.
To put this commitment into practice, Telefónica has a 
global due diligence process. This process is used to 
identify, prevent, mitigate and address potential or 
actual adverse impacts on people and the environment 
throughout the value chain, and is explained in section 
2.5. Due diligence.
S1-1_05
Telefónica's approach to employee engagement is 
based on transparency, inclusion and continuous 
improvement. The Company implements open 
communication policies and conducts regular surveys to 
ensure the active and meaningful participation of its 
workforce.
S1-1_06
Employees can ask questions about the code of ethics 
and conduct via the Queries Channel. Moreover, if an 
employee believes that their human rights have been 
violated, they have the option to report it anonymously 
via the Whistleblowing Channel. All reported incidents

Telefónica’s policies are aligned with key international 
frameworks on human and labour rights, including:
• The UN Guiding Principles on Business and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which foster 
the implementation of practices that respect human 
rights, promote fair and non-discriminatory working 
conditions, and ensure that operations respect 
fundamental rights, equality and dignified working 
conditions for all employees.
• The OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation 
and Development, guidelines, which promote 
corporate responsibility, transparency and respect for 
labour rights, with a particular emphasis on equal 
opportunities and workplace safety.
• ILO conventions, which advance the protection of 
labour rights, collective bargaining and the elimination 
of any form of discrimination or exploitation in the 
workplace.
 S1-1_08
Telefónica’s Global Human Rights Policy sets out its 
commitment to human rights, including the prohibition 
of human trafficking, forced labour and child labour.
S1-1_09
Global Occupational Health, Safety and Well-
being Regulation
This regulation establishes a framework for general and 
specific commitments that make it possible to prevent, 
reduce and monitor risks associated with the normal 
course of business and encourage a culture of safety in 
which all parties assume their responsibility and 
prevention is integrated into all hierarchical levels of the 
Company, thereby providing safe and healthy working 
conditions. There are also health and safety 
management systems in place that are certified and 
aligned with the applicable legal frameworks in each 
country.
S1-1_10, S1-1_11, S1-1_12, S1-1_13 
Global Equality Policy
The Global Equality Policy supports the Company’s 
commitment to gender equality and opposition to all 
forms of harassment, prioritising working conditions that 
prevent workplace, sexual and/or gender- or sex-based 
harassment.
Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy
The Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out a 
commitment to equal opportunities and the non-
discriminatory treatment of individuals across all areas of 
the organisation, taking a firm stance against any 
conduct or practice associated with prejudice on the 
grounds of the following factors, inter alia: nationality, 
ethnic origin, skin colour, marital status, family 
responsibility, religion, age, disability, social status, 
political opinion, serological and health status, gender, 
sex, sexual orientation and gender identity or expression.
At a local level, action protocols adapted to applicable 
legislation are implemented to address cases of 
workplace, moral and sexual harassment and 
discrimination. These protocols are designed to prevent 
and mitigate these situations and to facilitate an 
effective response should such situations be detected.
Despite no groups at particular risk of vulnerability being 
detected, they are covered through the Global Diversity 
and Inclusion Policy.
Global Privacy Policy
The Policy establishes the general guidelines that must 
be implemented for the processing of personal data of 
individuals, including Telefónica Group employees, not 
only in compliance with the applicable legal frameworks 
in each jurisdiction but also in accordance with 
standardised and uniform criteria that create a common 
and general approach to privacy across the Group.
The Global Privacy Policy adheres to the principles of 
lawfulness, transparency, commitment to data subject 
rights, security, and storage limitation.

2.11.2.2. Engagement with employees and 
their representatives
S1-2_01
Telefónica is dedicated to fostering an environment of 
active engagement and collaboration with employees 
and their representatives. The information gathered 
through the different means of communication with 
employees (such as surveys, meetings and other 
information channels) is analysed and used specifically 
to make decisions and implement measures related to 
the management of both actual and potential workplace 
incidents. For example, the results of the annual 
employee survey are presented to the Company’s 
executive committee.
Incident management is supported by a structured 
system for identifying, reporting and monitoring cases 
related to working conditions and workers’ rights.

Moreover, information from workers’ representatives is 
gathered through regular meetings.
S1-2_03
Collaboration with employees and workers’ 
representatives is managed locally and meets the needs 
of each business and country in which Telefónica 
operates. As a result, the phases, types and frequency of 
collaboration vary by country and business unit. They 
also vary depending on whether the collaboration takes 
place with Telefónica's own employees or with workers’ 
representatives.
In general, when working directly with the Company's 
own employees, there are different types of 
collaboration:
• Feedback meetings in which employees can raise any 
feedback and suggestions. The frequency of these 
meetings varies according to the business/country.
• Surveys and questionnaires to gather information on 
employee satisfaction and needs. A global survey is 
conducted annually.
• Working groups to address specific issues and 
develop solutions. These are ad-hoc meetings held as 
needed.
Collaboration with employee representatives involves 
joint committees convened quarterly, annually or 
monthly, depending on the subject matter and the 
country or business unit, addressing compliance with 
the commitments made, monitoring them and proposing 
possible measures for improvement.
S1-2_04
For agreements with the greatest impact such as 
collective bargaining agreements, the highest-ranking 
Company official involved is the Human Resources 
Director of each business. For global agreements, the 
ultimate responsibility lies with the Telefónica Group’s 
Global Chief People Officer. Labour Relations teams are 
responsible for monitoring the actions and day-to-day 
activities of each business.
S1-2_05
Telefónica is committed to the core ILO standards, 
particularly regarding freedom of association and the 
right to collective bargaining in all the countries in which 
it operates.
In addition, the Company reaffirms the important role 
played by trade unions in defending the interests of 
workers and recognises the UNI Global Union (UNI) and 
the European Works Council (EWC) as key partners in 
the management of international labour relations.
The main aspects included in these agreements are the 
recognition and ratification of the commitment to 
fundamental human rights and respect for applicable 
standards regarding health and safety, equality, diversity 
and the environment in the workplace. To promote the 
effectiveness of these agreements, meetings are held 
annually with UNI and every six months with the EWC, in 
addition to maintaining regular contact with them. These 
agreements allow Telefónica to gain deeper insights into 
employee perspectives through:
• Direct contact: regular meetings and consultations 
with union representatives provide the Company with 
first-hand insights into workers’ experiences and 
concerns, enabling it to comprehensively monitor 
potential incidents that may arise in the different 
countries.
• Continuous improvement: the ongoing nature of the 
Global Framework Agreements helps Telefónica to 
constantly learn from and adapt to the changing 
needs and perspectives of employees.
S1-2_06
The assessment of the effectiveness of the relationship 
with employees and workers’ representatives is 
measured in a number of ways.
With regard to employees, it is measured through the 
annual motivation survey, which provides information on 
their level of satisfaction and commitment and enables 
the Company to make informed decisions. The survey is 
anonymous and the responses are analysed by a third 
party to maintain data confidentiality.
With regard to the relationship with workers’ 
representatives, the effectiveness of the various 
committees is assessed by the agreements reached 
following negotiations and the absence of labour 
conflicts.
Both assessment processes follow a structured 
approach, involving continuous collection of data on the 
results obtained.
2.11.2.3. Remediation processes and 
engagement channels with employees
S1-3_01
Telefónica takes a proactive approach to the 
remediation of actual material adverse impacts that may 
affect employees. Employees can report incidents 
through the Whistleblowing Channel. Incidents are 
thoroughly analysed, and corrective measures are 
implemented to address them effectively. 
For more details on privacy and data protection 
processes, procedures and policies, see:
 2.13.3. Action plans, metrics and targets
Channels for employees to express their 
concerns
S1-3_02
Telefónica has several channels set up by the Company 
itself and designed for employees to express their 
concerns, needs and suggestions in an accessible way:

2.11.2.4. Action plans
S1.MDR-A_01-12, S1-4_02, S1-4_05
All the actions mentioned have a global scope although 
each action is implemented and adapted by the 
operators according to local needs and specific 
regulatory contexts. The activities fall within the stages 
of the value chain relating to supporting activities.
The time horizons for each initiative depend on the 
nature and local context of the action, with goals defined 
on a short-, medium- and long-term basis. The goals are 
regularly assessed through key indicators, internal audits 
and satisfaction and motivation surveys.
With regard to impacts affecting Telefónica employees, 
if an incident occurs, a structured process is in place to 
identify, analyse and monitor any issues related to 
working conditions and workers’ rights, as well as to 
implement appropriate actions to remedy the incident.
S1-4_01, S1-4_04
The effectiveness of the actions is assessed by 
reviewing the indicators associated with each of them.
Further information can be found in the Metrics section 
of this chapter.
Telefónica has a Global Human Resources Committee 
made up of the heads of the People area of the main 
operators and regions in which it operates. The 
committee meets monthly to review and monitor these 
actions, ensuring progress towards targets and metrics.
Actions to mitigate negative impacts  
The Company has adopted various measures to mitigate 
material negative impacts on equal treatment and 
opportunities for all (S1_IN01) affecting its own employees:
• Inclusion and diversity policies that promote gender 
equity, including protocols to prevent sexual 
harassment and workplace discrimination.
• Equitable selection and promotion processes. For 
executive selection processes, the Company has a 
Transparency Committee, composed of the Chair and 
four senior executives, which ensures the presence of 
both genders among the final shortlisted candidates. A 
diverse panel is also put forward to interview potential 
candidates.

management of the risks associated with protecting 
employee data.
S1-4_03
Actions to generate positive impacts
The initiatives that Telefónica is working on to generate 
positive impacts for its workforce are:
Working conditions
As regards secure employment, working time, adequate 
wages and work-life balance (S1_IP01), the Company 
carries out the following actions:
• Permanent contracts are prioritised to ensure job 
stability, in addition to having specific programs for 
young talent, such as scholarships and internships, the 
impact of which is monitored through regular reports.
• Pay reviews are conducted regularly and professional 
classification systems have been implemented to 
promote competitiveness and equity. Additional 
benefits are offered such as share schemes and salary 
advances.
• Digital disconnection is encouraged through initiatives 
adapted to local regulations, such as flexible hours, 
gradual reductions in weekly working hours, hybrid 
and remote work, and record-keeping systems to 
regulate overtime. The Company offers extended 
family care leave and parental leave.
With regard to social dialogue, freedom of association 
and collective bargaining measures (S1_IP02), at local level 
there are joint committees to ensure compliance with 
collective agreements and adapt labour policies to the 
needs of employees. There are agreements with UNI and 
with the EWC, European Works Council, establishing a 
framework for continuous dialogue and cooperation with 
trade unions at a global level.
With regard to health and safety (S1_IP03), a preventative 
approach to health, safety and occupational well-being 
is followed, with ongoing training, health campaigns and 
psychosocial support. Telefónica promotes the overall 
well-being of its employees and maintains a healthy 
work environment. In addition, safety standards are 
monitored by committees, as well as through internal 
and external audits.
These actions are expected to continue in the coming 
years. The intended result of these actions is to ensure 
safe and fair working conditions that are in line with best 
labour practices, promoting stable employment, work-
life balance and competitiveness at salary level.
Equal treatment and opportunities for all
• In terms of training and skills development (S1_IP04), 
Telefónica focuses on the professional development of 
its employees through training and reskilling programs, 
which include courses on emerging technologies, 
digital skills and leadership, tailored to local needs. The 
Company assesses skills development through 
internal management tools and the Skills Workforce 
Planning process.
• To prevent workplace violence and harassment in the 
workplce (S1_IP05), the Company has implemented a 
global confidential reporting procedure and specific

action protocols. It runs awareness-raising courses 
and monitors these plans through specialised 
committees in each country.
• To foster diversity and inclusion (S1_IP06), Telefónica 
implements global policies on gender equality, support 
for the LGBTI+ community and inclusion of people 
with different backgrounds, ages and abilities. It 
promotes female talent through local-level initiatives 
such as training and leadership programs for women, 
specialised workshops and awareness-raising 
activities.
These actions are expected to continue in the coming 
years. The intended result is to be able to offer quality 
jobs and competitive and attractive working 
conditions.
S1-4_06
Actions regarding material risks and 
opportunities
During the 2024 financial year, the following actions 
were undertaken to mitigate the material risks arising 
from the impacts and dependencies related to 
Telefónica employees:
In relation to the health and safety risk identified in 
operations in Ecuador and Chile due to incidents such as 
theft, vandalism and riots (S1_RI01), the operators 
conducted the following actions:
• To safeguard employees and facilities, Telefónica 
implemented a physical security plan featuring 
physical, electronic and procedural measures, 
alongside training.
• To ensure the effectiveness of these programs, the 
Company put monitoring and emergency response 
systems in place, such as a 24/7 security operations 
centre in Ecuador and Chile. The security procedures 
include an action guide for various types of 
emergencies. Audits and compliance evaluations are 
also conducted, enabling the identification and 
correction of areas for improvement in the Group’s 
policies and procedures.
• Lastly, transparent and participatory communication 
channels were put in place so that employees can 
express their opinions and remain informed about 
safety protocols. Examples include the Ecuador 
Operations Centre telephone line for quick contact 
with the Security team and the direct contact line in 
Chile, which allows employees to report risk situations 
in real time.
These actions are expected to continue in the coming 
years. The intended result is a reduction in incidents 
relating to theft, vandalism and riots.
Regarding the dependency risk belonging to the sub-
subtopic of training and skills development (S1_RI02), the 
actions carried out by Telefónica to mitigate the risk of a 
shortage of technological talent and the need for new 
skills in the workforce are part of the strategic Skills 
Workforce Planning process, which identifies the skills 
available within the organisation and those needed for 
business growth. This process helps with making well-
informed decisions to close the skills gap through:
• Internal skills development: launching large-scale 
reskilling and upskilling programs to develop skills that 
are critical for the business while improving the 
employability of professionals. Telefónica Tech also 
offers certification programs for employees in third-
party digital technologies.
• Attracting the best talent by leveraging digital 
platforms, social media, networking events, fairs and 
forums at technology-focused universities. 
Furthermore, the Company strengthens its pool of 
young talent through various scholarship and 
internship programs.
These actions are expected to continue in the coming 
years. The intended result is to reduce the skills gap in 
the workforce and ensure the availability of the talent 
the Company needs for business growth.
S1-4_07  
The actions undertaken to capitalise on the identified 
material opportunity concerning health and safety focus 
on implementing comprehensive risk prevention 
programs and continuous training in order to reduce 
workplace accidents and occupational illnesses. 
Specialized training and awareness campaigns are 
planned to continue. These initiatives are expected to 
contribute to reducing the incident rate, improving 
regulatory compliance and strengthening employee 
well-being.
Responsible practices and allocated resources
S1-4_08
Telefónica believes that its activities do not generate 
material negative impacts on its employees. To minimise 
potential impacts, the Company has global policies on 
human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion. Similarly, 
it conducts internal and external audits and assesses 
labour and human rights risks. It also has confidential 
whistleblowing channels and monitors indicators such 
as the gender pay gap and the percentage of women in 
executive positions, as well as responses to the 
motivation survey. Furthermore, it promotes work-life 
balance measures, flexibility, equal opportunities and 
safe environments, ensuring swift action if any 
irregularities are identified.
S1-4_09
The Company allocates human, financial, technological 
and infrastructure resources to manage negative and 
positive impacts and mitigate risks by enhancing 
initiatives that benefit employees.
It also allocates budget to audits and labour 
improvements, using technological tools to manage

of material IROs
S1.MDR-T_01-13
S1-5_01, S1-5_02, S1-5_03
Equal treatment and opportunities for all
The main metric used by the Company to assess the 
performance and effectiveness of the action plans 
relating to the material negative impact on equal 
treatment and opportunities for all (S1_IN01) for own 
employees is
Representation of women in executive positions
Target: 37% of executive positions to be held by women 
by 2027.
To make progress towards meeting the target by 2027, 
Telefónica has set interim targets:
2024: 33.4% of executive positions to be held by women.
2025: 34.6% of executive positions to be held by women.
Methodology and scope
This indicator is measured based on the total number of 
Telefónica Group executives at the end of December of 
the corresponding year.
The executives of the Telefónica Group are defined as 
being the group subject to specific governance 
conditions inside the Group. The appointment of 
executives consists of two stages: first, the 
Transparency Committee reviews the proposals to 
ensure compliance with the transparency and gender 
equality policies. Then, the proposal is validated by the 
Nominating and Compensation Committee.
The baseline year against which progress is measured is 
2020, in which the baseline value was 27.4%.
Performance in 2024: at year end, 34% of executive 
positions were held by women.
Monitoring 
The indicator is monitored on a monthly basis.
The target is quantifiable and absolute and is aligned 
with the main commitments of the diversity and 
inclusion policies, as well as the Global Equality Policy: 
guaranteeing equal opportunities and non-
discriminatory treatment and promoting gender equality. 
Furthermore, the target of representation of women in 
executive positions is one of the sustainable financing 
indicators.
Privacy 
The main metrics used by the Company to assess the 
performance and effectiveness of the action plans relating 
to the impact and material risks identified concerning 
privacy (S1_RI03 and S1_IN02) of employee data are:
• Total number of procedures opened due to privacy/
data protection issues with a penalty or employee 
claim:
Performance in 2024: 0.
• Total number of confirmed fines for privacy/data 
protection issues affecting employees: with no option 
to appeal, issued by a competent authority, and 
becoming final during the reporting year:
Performance in 2024: 0.
• Total number of confirmed fines for privacy/data 
protection issues affecting employees:
Performance in 2024: 0.
Methodology and scope
The methodology is based on a structured process led 
by the global Data Privacy area (DPO), which has the 
goal of collecting key information about the Group’s 
main significant operations. The process begins with 
requests for specific data related to the metrics and the 
evidence that supports them. These metrics and 
evidence are, in turn, provided by the legal areas and 
based on the cases managed by those areas, to gather 
accurate and traceable information.
The metrics are aligned with the commitments 
established in the Global Privacy Policy and the Global 
Human Rights Policy, respecting the right to the 
protection of personal data.
Targets
Target-setting is not applicable due to the nature of the 
indicator, which is dependent on the variability of the 
penalties and the sanction procedures. These processes 
do not follow a regular annual cycle but tend to be 
drawn out over longer periods, making it difficult to 
adapt them to pre-established intervals.
Furthermore, the authorities' criteria evolve and new 
national regulations can emerge, as in the case of Brazil, 
Ecuador or Chile, which complicates predictability. 
Additionally, the administrative and judicial proceedings 
of which the sanction procedures are a part also 
introduce an additional variable that hampers the 
establishment of specific goals.

Working conditions, diversity, training and skills 
development
For the sub-subtopics of secure employment, working 
time, adequate wages, work-life balance and health and 
safety, which fall under the subtopic of working 
conditions, and the sub-subtopics of diversity and 
training and skills development (S1_IP01, S1_IP04 and S1_IP06), 
Telefónica uses the following metric:
Employee satisfaction
Target: maintain the employee Net Promoter Score 
(eNPS) at over 70 points during the time horizon of the 
24-26 strategic plan.
The eNPS measures employee satisfaction at the 
organisation. The survey also includes questions about 
the work environment, well-being, learning, leadership, 
work-life balance, diversity and inclusion and non-
discrimination.
Methodology and scope
At Telefónica this indicator has been monitored since 
2019 and is calculated through a relationship survey, in 
which employees are asked if they would recommend 
Telefónica as a good place to work. The result is 
obtained by subtracting the number of promoters 
(ratings of 9 and 10) from the number of detractors 
(ratings of 1 to 6).
This survey is conducted annually among all the 
employees who are part of the Telefónica Group.
The target is quantifiable and absolute and is aligned 
with the commitments and core values of the 
Responsible Business Plan in areas such as respecting 
and promoting human rights, and is particularly aligned 
with the point concerning commitment to employees, 
diversity, inclusion and equality.
The baseline year against which progress is measured is 
2019, in which the baseline value was 58.4 points.
Performance in 2024: the eNPS was 75 points.
Monitoring
This indicator is reviewed annually. The results of the 
survey are used as a basis for adapting the actions, if 
necessary.
In addition, the overall results for this indicator are 
shared with the Executive Committee. The heads of the 
business units, departments and areas have the 
aggregate results for their teams.
Training and skills development
With regard to the dependency risk belonging to the 
sub-subtopic of training and skills development (S1_RI02), 
the goal used is:
Skills in the workforce
Target: reduce the skills and profiles gap in the 
workforce identified during the Skills Workforce 
Planning process.
Methodology and scope
A strategic skill-related planning process (Skills 
Workforce Planning) linked to the strategic plan is 
conducted on an annual basis to align the skills available 
at the organisation and those that are needed to 
execute the plan. This is a global process, focusing on 
critical areas at the Company. This process identifies a 
specific number of profiles and skills in the workforce.
The target is quantifiable and absolute and is tailored to 
the needs identified in the strategic plan.
The baseline year against which the progress of this 
Skills Workforce Planning process is measured is 2020.
Performance: the Skills Workforce Planning process for 
the 2024-26 strategic plan identified an evolution in the 
necessary profiles and a reduction in the number of skills 
required in the workforce.
Monitoring
The closing of the skills gap is reviewed on an annual 
basis. The results are shared with the Executive 
Committee and with the leaders of each business unit, 
and have been progressing favourably since inception.
Health and safety (S1_RI01)
Target: reduce the number of incidents regarding the 
physical security of people and increase the percentage 
of employees that have received training in physical 
security.
Methodology and scope
Those who are responsible at local level for operational 
security, surveillance and protection report the 
indicators contained in the global manual under 
Indicators of People's Safety.
The target is quantifiable and relative and adapts to local 
security plans.
The baseline for this target is the number of incidents 
recorded in 2022. The baseline value varies depending 
on the country.
Performance: in 2024, no security incidents were 
recorded in Ecuador, while there were three incidents 
related to vehicle theft in Chile.
Monitoring
On a six-monthly basis, those responsible at local level 
for operational security, surveillance and protection 
monitor the risk level for people’s safety. These 
indicators are reported to the Global Operational 
Security Directorate.

Consolidated Annual Report 2024
Telefónica, S. A.
132

The scope of this analysis affects all the companies of 
the Telefónica Group, with due regard for the specific 
characteristics deriving from the legislation applicable to 
each of them.
The metrics concerning people’s safety must be 
reported by the local officer responsible for operational 
security, surveillance and protection at each business 
unit, including incidents affecting any person on 
Telefónica's premises.
Monitoring and managing health and safety, 
social dialogue and harassment prevention
The effectiveness of the actions implemented to 
manage the rest of the impacts, risks and opportunities 
(IROs) defined herein are measured through the 
monitoring of indicators associated with each of them. 
However, each operation manages its targets, metrics, 
methodology and monitoring on an individual basis, 
according to the regulatory and organisational context, 
which gives rise to decentralised management instead 
of global monitoring. In these cases, each operation 
adapts its measures and targets in accordance with its 
regulatory and organisational situation.
By way of example, on the issue of health and safety 
(S1_OP01 and S1_IP03), there are local initiatives at Telefónica 
Spain, where indicators such as the accident frequency 
rate are monitored, and Telefónica Brazil, where 
accident-related indicators are monitored. These local 
targets have set goals, established time frames, specific 
methodologies and tracking mechanisms. The indicators 
are quantifiable and, depending on the case, can be 
constant or relational. In addition, they apply to all the 
workers of each country and are in line with the 
commitments established in the Global Occupational 
Health, Safety and Well-being Regulation.
In terms of social dialogue, freedom of association and 
collective bargaining (S1_IP02), each country defines its 
targets and establishes specific metrics, methodologies 
and tracking mechanisms. However, as a minimum, the 
actions tend to include fostering ongoing dialogue 
through meetings of joint committees, negotiations of 
agreements or their corresponding extensions.
With regard to the measures against violence and 
harassment in the workplace (S1_IP05), the target is to 
minimise situations of workplace, sexual or gender-
based harassment. The global metric for this is the 
number of employees who have taken the Responsible 
Business Principles course, which sets out Telefónica’s 
commitment regarding non-toleration of these 
situations. For information about the scope, 
methodology and monitoring of the measurement of this 
course, see the following section:
 2.14.3.3. Training
Regular supervision and assessment is also conducted 
through the compilation of data and reports, enabling 
effective monitoring of the positive impact of these 
practices on working conditions and the relationships 
between employers and workers. These measures apply 
to all the workers and are aligned with the commitments 
established in the Responsible Business Principles, the 
Global Human Rights Policy and international labour 
rights standards.
Since the establishment of all the goals described 
herein, the associated indicators have evolved 
favourably.
Although stakeholders do not participate in target-
setting, their feedback is taken into consideration when 
reviewing performance and setting new targets.
All the required information relating to stakeholder 
involvement in target-setting is specified in the following

S1-16_01
The gender pay gap in 2024 was 16.19%. 
S1-16_03
The gender pay gap is obtained by calculating the 
difference between the total average remuneration of 
men and the total average remuneration of women at 
the organisation, without taking into account other 
aspects that enable comparability.
S1-16_02
The ratio of the annual total remuneration of the 
Executive Chairman (CEO) to the median annual total 
remuneration for all employees in 2024 was 111:1.
S1-16_03
In order to calculate the ratio of the annual remuneration 
of the Executive Chairman to the median annual total 
remuneration for all employees, the calculation took into 
account the total remuneration accrued by the 
Executive Chairman in 2024, which for these purposes 
includes the sum of the fixed remuneration, short-term 
variable pay, long-term incentive and benefits; the same 
elements were taken into consideration for all active 
employees in the Group as at 31 December 2024. To 
consider the purchasing power differences between the 
countries where the Company operates, the median 
total remuneration of the employees in each country has 
been adjusted with the relationship between the 
minimum wage established in each country and the 
minimum wage in Spain. The weighted average of all the 
medians is then calculated to obtain the final data.

In 2024, a total of 62 cases of discrimination and/or 
harassment were reported. The data come, firstly, from 
the complaints filed through the Whistleblowing 
Channel (a total of 55), which were analysed and found 
to be substantiated. Secondly, the cases of litigation4 for 
inequality/discrimination brought during the reference 
period were also incorporated (a total of 7).
S1-17_03
There were 992 complaints filed through the 
Whistleblowing Channel in 2024. As the channel allows 
complaints to be filed anonymously, it is not possible to 
identify what percentage of the total number of claims 
recorded were from Telefónica's own employees.

The economic value of the discrimination and/or 
harassment lawsuits brought during 2024 is not 
significant.
S1-17_08, S1-17_09, S1-17_10
Without prejudice to the information provided above, no 
severe human rights incidents were recorded in 2024

2.12. ESRS S2 - Workers in the 
value chain
2.12.1. Strategy
Telefónica has conducted an analysis of the value chain, 
assessing its activities and agents with the aim of 
managing the IROs related to the workers who form part 
of it.
S2. ESRS 2 - SBM 2
Feedback and concerns of workers in the value 
chain
Workers in the value chain are one of the Company’s key 
stakeholder groups, and as such Telefónica provides 
general and specific channels to receive their feedback 
and concerns, while respecting and promoting their 
human rights. These expectations are integrated into the 
Company's strategy and business model, as explained in 
the section:
 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations
In addition, to mitigate both actual and potential 
negative impacts related to human rights, workers in the 
value chain have access to the Whistleblowing Channel 
and the Queries Channel, as explained in Due diligence 
phase 6:
 Phase 6. Remediation of adverse impacts
S2. ESRS 2 - SBM 3
Linking IROs to the strategy and business model
The relationship between the strategy and business 
model and value chain worker-related impacts is 
outlined in the section:
 2.3.2. Linking material impacts to the strategy and the 
business model
Types of workers in the value chain
S2.SBM-3_01, S2.SBM-3_02, S2.SBM-3_03
The Company has identified the different types of 
workers who may be significantly impacted in the 
different stages of the value chain: 
Upstream
There are two types of workers in this stage: product 
supplier workers, such as device factory employees  (e.g. 
routers and mobile phones), and those of works and 
services suppliers involved in network deployment. Both 
types could be subject to negative health and safety 
impacts (S2_IN03). 
Operations
Furthermore, the following workers involved in carrying 
out Company activities could also be impacted: 
• Telefónica's own workforce (see chapter ESRS S1).  
• Workers of contractors, such as workers involved in 
network maintenance and dismantling.
Downstream
The workers that could be significantly impacted by the 
identified IROs in this stage are call centre employees 
and other customer service workers.
Impacts
S2.SBM-3_05
Telefónica has around 8,500 direct suppliers that 
perform activities throughout its value chain each year.
The identified material negative impacts (S2_IN01, S2_IN02, 
S2_IN03 and S2_IN04) are related to individual cases detected 
at some direct and indirect suppliers, and therefore 
cannot be considered widespread or systemic incidents. 
These cases are mostly found in specific countries/
regions with insufficient legal and social safeguards or 
where these are poorly enforced. 
For instance, in some countries in Asia or South America, 
cases have been identified of excessive working hours 
(S2_IN01) due to more permissive regulations.
Similarly, certain activities carry inherent risks of 
potential negative impacts. For example, network 
deployment, which often involves working at height or 
with electricity, is considered a high-risk activity, which 
increases the likelihood of health and safety adverse 
impacts (S2_IN03).
S2.SBM-3_06
The Company recognises the role it plays in generating 
positive impacts (S2_IP01 and S2_IP02) for the aforementioned 
different types of workers in its value chain. The action 
plans outlined below (contractual clauses, potential risk 
analysis, external sustainability assessments and on site 
audits) not only support to manage negative impacts, 
but they also encourage the creation of jobs with fair, 
safe and stable conditions.

The information about actions that generate positive 
impacts can be found in:
 2.12.2.2. Action plans
Risks  
S2.SBM-3_07
The material risks arising from impacts and 
dependencies linked to workers in the value chain have 
also been identified.
Negative impacts related to working conditions (S2_IN01, 
S2_IN02 and S2_IN03) could also lead to related reputational 
risks and sanctions (S2_RI01 and S2_RI02).
Workers in specific environments and/or 
activities
S2.SBM-3_08
Having carried out a risk analysis and benchmarking of 
the value chain and its workers, Telefónica has identified 
the factors that increase risks for certain types of 
workers.
Firstly, within the value chain, there are some high-risk 
activities in terms of sustainability. According to 
Telefónica's internal risk analysis, these include network 
deployment and maintenance, the production and
assembly of goods for business development, and call 
centres, among others. 
Therefore, workers involved in these activities are more 
likely to be exposed to these impacts. 
As a second factor, it has been found that certain 
regions, countries and/or jurisdictions may pose a high 
potential risk for workers. For example, labour rights 
regulations are more lax in some Asian countries. 
Therefore, workers located in these areas are more likely 
to be exposed to these impacts.
S2.SBM-3_09
The material risks related to workers in the value chain 
are directly linked to the material negative impacts. 
Therefore, the materialisation of the risks relates to the 
aforementioned workers.

2.12.2.1. Policies
S2-1_01  
Telefónica’s commitment to human rights stems from its 
Global Human Rights Policy and is reflected in all the 
policies mentioned in “Other Policies” below. 
Global Human Rights Policy
This policy highlights Telefónica’s commitment to 
respecting and promoting human rights in general, and 
those of workers in the value chain in particular. It is 
specifically highlighted in section 3.4 (Commitment to 
the respect for human rights in the supply chain, and  
relationships with business partners), which requires 
compliance with the minimum responsible business 
criteria. 
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy
The Company demonstrates its commitment to human 
rights in the value chain and the human rights of value 
chain workers mainly through its Supply Chain 
Sustainability Policy, alongside other policies on specific 
issues (such as, but not limited to, privacy and security) 
that are explained in detail in the “Other Policies” 
section.

Other policies
S2.MDR-P_01-06
Although the main policy for managing and addressing 
the IROs linked to workers in the value chain is the 
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, Telefónica also uses 
the following policies to facilitate the proper and 
comprehensive management of the material IROs: 
• Global Human Rights Policy. 
• Occupational Health, Safety and Well-being 
Regulation.
• Global Privacy Policy.
• Global Security Policy.
• Workplace Risk Instruction for the Procurement of 
Works and Services ICC001.
The MDR-P-required information on the policies 
adopted to manage sustainability issues is gathered and 
reported in the following section of the Sustainability 
notes:
  2.15. Policies
S2-1_02, S2-1_06
Telefónica enforces its human rights commitments and 
policy implementation through a global due diligence 
process. This process is used to identify, prevent, 
mitigate and remedy negative impacts—whether 
potential or actual—that may affect people or the 
environment throughout the value chain. 
This process, grounded in the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights and other international 
agreements, is outlined in the Global Human Rights 
Policy.
In the specific case of workers in the value chain, 
commitments are mainly implemented through the 
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy. This policy acts as a 
code of conduct for the suppliers. It sets out the 
minimum criteria that the supplier must comply with, 
including respect for their workers’ human rights. Among 
other aspects, it requires the respect for labour rights, 
including compliance with working hour regulations, 
ensuring a safe work environment and facilitating 
unionisation and collective bargaining.
S2-1_03, S2-1_04, S2-1_08, S2-1_09
To uphold the rights of workers in the value chain, the 
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy aligns with the 
following international standards:
• The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
• OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development) guidelines. 
• Conventions of the International Labour Organization. 
The content, commitments and requirements outlined in 
the policies were developed based on these regulations 
and apply to all of Telefónica’s business activities. These 
policies serve as the foundation for the responsible 
supply chain management process. 
As part of this process, the Company implements action 
plans to identify, mitigate and prevent the occurrence of 
negative impacts, and to remedy them when they do 
occur. 
S2-4
2.12.2.2. Action plans
S2-4_01, S2-4_03, S2-4_08
As part of its due diligence process and commitment to 
human rights, Telefónica undertakes the following 
actions to prevent, mitigate and remedy the negative 
impacts and promote the material positive impacts that 
affect workers in its value chain: 
1. Contractual clauses. 
2.Potential risk analysis. 
3.External sustainability assessments. 
4.On-site audits. 
To implement these actions, it follows the process 
described in the section 2.14.5. Suppliers. 
Considering that the material risks for workers in the 
value chain are directly linked to negative impacts, these 
actions help prevent and/or mitigate any risk that may 
affect Telefónica, taking into account that these actions 
may also generate future opportunities for the Company. 
Telefónica uses the following two mechanisms to 
evaluate and monitor the maturity of these actions: 
• Sustainability in the supply chain basic risk as part of 
the Company's risk model (ERM), which monitors 
potential sustainability impacts in the supply chain.
• Global impact assessments, which assess the maturity 
of the Company's due diligence process, including the 
actions within the supply chain management process. 
S2.MDR-A_01-12
1. Contractual clauses 
The material IROs are managed through the inclusion of 
contractual clauses in the General Conditions for the 
Supply of Goods and Services of the Telefónica Group, 
the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, and other 
agreements with suppliers.

These clauses require suppliers to adhere to ethical 
standards aligned with those the Company follows and 
to uphold fundamental human and labour rights. 
100% of suppliers included in the Telefónica 
Procurement Model (MCT for its acronym in Spanish) 
must accept these clauses and conduct their business in 
accordance with Telefónica’s minimum responsible 
business criteria. This percentage is measured annually 
to monitor the progress of the action plan. The Company 
plans to continue requiring its suppliers to accept these 
clauses in the coming years.
This requirement applies to commercial relationships 
with suppliers in all markets in which the Company 
operates. Thus, including suppliers throughout all stages 
of the value chain. 
The acceptance of these contractual clauses must be 
done for each awarded contract as part of Telefónica's 
Procurement Model. 
Therefore, all Telefónica suppliers must accept these 
clauses upon registering and/or renewing their account 
in the Procurement platform. 
If suppliers breach these contractual clauses, and after a 
collaborative improvement process, detailed in action 
plans 3 and 4, Telefónica may use these clauses to 
terminate the contractual relationship. 
S2-4_05
2. Potential risk analysis 
To manage material IROs, Telefónica focuses on those 
suppliers with a high potential risk in terms of 
sustainability, considering factors such as the country of 
origin and the type of products or services supplied. 
These suppliers are selected through a potential risk 
analysis, to which all suppliers are subjected under the 
procurement model. Telefónica plans to continue 
analysing the potential of its suppliers in the coming years.
Telefónica applies the level of potential risk resulting from 
this analysis to prioritise its actions as part of the 
responsible supply chain management process. The risk 
level of each supplier is used to determine the specific 
measures to manage potential impacts within the value 
chain.  
Hence, for suppliers identified as having a higher social 
risk, the Company sets stricter labour requirements and 
conducts a more rigorous oversight than for lower-risk 
suppliers. 
This requirement applies to commercial relationships 
with suppliers within the Procurement Model in all 
markets in which it operates, throughout all stages of the 
value chain. 
The supplier risk analysis is conducted for each award 
contract made through the Procurement Model 
throughout the year. 
3. External sustainability assessments 
To manage material IROs, Telefónica requires its 
suppliers with a potential high risk as a result of the risk 
analysis explained above, to perform an external 360º 
assessment based on 15 sustainability criteria that 
encompass ethical, social and environmental aspects 
and the management of their supply chain.
The scope of this requirement applies to commercial 
relationships with potentially high-risk suppliers, 
according to the Company’s internal risk analysis, in all 
its markets. Thus, including suppliers throughout all 
stages of the value chain. 
Information relating to suppliers externally assessed on 
sustainability aspects through the IntegrityNext platform 
is detailed in 'Step 3. Performance assessment of 
potential high-risk suppliers' in section 2.14.5. Suppliers. 
Supplier sustainability assessments are conducted 
continuously, with supplier data being updated annually.  
The Company plans to continue requiring the fulfilment of 
these external sustainability assessments to its potentially 
high risk suppliers. 
4. On-site audits 
To manage material IROs, Telefónica also verifies 
compliance with the responsible minimum business 
responsibility criteria it requires of its suppliers through 
an annual audit plan.
As part of this plan, improvement plans are agreed upon 
with all suppliers that fail to comply with any aspects 
that could have a negative social or environmental 
impact. 
Telefónica’s annual audit plan includes two programs. 
The scope of the audits varies according to the program 
through which they are conducted. 
The audits conducted under the Allies Program focus on 
service providers with a high sustainability risk. These 
audits primarily target direct suppliers in Telefónica’s 
markets in Europe, Brazil and Hispanoamerica. 
The audits carried out at sectoral level within the 
framework of the JAC (Joint Alliance for CSR) are aimed 
at direct and indirect product manufacturers in countries 
with a high sustainability risk. These audits target direct 
and indirect suppliers primarily in Asia.
Further information on the audits conducted is provided 
in 'Step 4. Key supplier audits' of section:

The Company plans to continue verifying suppliers' 
compliance with the required responsible minimum 
business criteria through the on-site audits.  
S2-4_02, S2-4_07
If negative impacts on workers in the value chain occur, 
Telefónica has established protocols within the JAC and 
Allies audits to ensure the appropriate remediation. 
These protocols are implemented as part of the audit 
process and are available before, during and after the 
audit.
Telefónica collaborates with independent third parties, 
internal experts and/or the supplier itself to ensure 
effective implementation of the protocols and the 
resolution of non-conformities through agreed action 
plans and their corresponding results.
Examples of how the Company resolves non-
conformities are given below: 
Management of audit non-conformities
Aspect 
Non-conformities
Corrective action/ remediation
Freedom of association
Site employees have no access to trade unions or 
workers' associations. 
Guarantee the existence of a trade union and/or 
workers' association, accompanied by trainings on 
the right to freedom of association that workers 
can exercise through these.
Health and safety
Contractor were observed in a warehouse without 
mandatory person protective equipment (PPE). 
Increase control checks over the use of PPE to 
ensure that all the employees use the same. 
Training and skills 
development
Workers without educational qualifications, 
specific training and/or work experience in 
accordance to their profile specifications were 
identified. 
Review and update the register of employee 
profiles and skills. Provide training or other 
measures to close identified skills gaps.
Working time
The site lacks an approval resolution from the 
competent local authority for its employees to 
work overtime.
Request the corresponding permit from the 
competent authority.
Work-life balance
Disconnecting from work is not promoted among 
workers.
Manage a plan that promotes disconnecting from 
work for employees. 
Privacy
Lack of security policies, standards and procedures 
based on international standards such as ISO/IEC 
27000.
Establish internal policies, procedures and/or 
protocols that regulate their governance and/or 
management model in terms of data protection.
S2-1_09, S2-4_11
These findings also include cases of non-compliance 
with the following international standards related to 
working conditions and other material work-related 
rights (S2_IN01, S2_IN02, S2_IN03 and S2_IN04):
• The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
• OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development) guidelines. 
• Conventions of the International Labour Organization. 
Despite the fact that these non-conformities have been 
detected through audits, no serious human rights 
incidents involving workers in the value chain were 
recorded in 2024. 
S2-4_06
Through its annual audit program, Telefónica seeks to 
manage specific negative impacts with the potentially 
high-risk suppliers it assesses. 
The impact of this management and commitment 
process has increased through the Company’s 
participation in the sectoral initiative Joint Alliance for 
CSR (JAC). The JAC initiative sees Telefónica and 29 
other telecommunications operators unite efforts to 
verify, assess and enhance the implementation of 
sustainability standards in the factories of mutual 
suppliers, mainly in at-risk areas such as Asia, Latin 
America and Eastern Europe. This enables Telefónica to 
assess suppliers beyond tier one, i.e. indirect suppliers. 
Dedicated working groups have also been formed within 
JAC, including one focused on due diligence in the 
supply chain. Through this group, the Company seeks 
ways to encourage the implementation of good 
practices throughout the ICT sector supply chain.
S2-4_04
As part of its responsible supply chain management 
process, Telefónica has established metrics, such as the 
number of suppliers assessed on sustainability issues, 
which enable it to evaluate the effectiveness of its 
processes. These metrics and targets are detailed in the 
section 2.14.5. Suppliers.

Furthermore, as part of its ERM (Enterprise Risk 
Management) framework, the Company has integrated 
core sustainability risks into its supply chain. This system 
enables Telefónica to assess the maturity of its supply 
chain management and determine whether its actions 
and initiatives yield the expected outcomes for workers 
in the value chain. 
 S2-4_10
As part of its Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, 
Telefónica also strives to ensure that its own activities do 
not contribute to the occurrence of negative impacts 
related to working conditions (S2_IN01, S2_IN02, S2_IN03 and 
S2_IN04) and, consequently, to the associated risks (S2_RI01 
and S2_RI02). 
This policy reflects Telefónica’s commitment to the 
highest standards of ethics, transparency and objectivity 
to promote a responsible business culture. The 
Company also works with suppliers to promote 
continuous improvement in meeting the minimum 
responsible business criteria and reserves the right to 
terminate the contractual relationship with any supplier 
that fails to comply with these criteria. 
S2-4_12
Managing the impacts related to workers in the value 
chain is a cross-cutting activity throughout the entire 
company, thus, no specific resources are defined. 
Instead, this activity is addressed by the different 
company departments. 
S2-3
2.12.2.3. Remediation processes and 
engagement channels with workers in the 
value chain
S2-3_01
Telefónica has: 
• multiple channels for workers in the value chain to voice 
concerns, and
• processes in place to address the concerns raised and, if 
necessary, provide assistance or collaborate on the 
remediation of negative impacts.
S2-3_02, S2-3_04, S2-3_06
Channels
As stated in the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, in the 
section on the Responsible Business Channel, 
Telefónica has made the Queries Channel and the 
Whistleblowing Channel available to workers in the 
value chain.
These channels are publicly available on Telefónica’s 
website for all stakeholders, including those working 
within the value chain. 
Queries (Responsible Business) Channel
The Telefónica Group provides a Queries Channel so 
that all stakeholders (including workers in the value 
chain) can directly address the Company with queries 
related to any aspect of the Responsible Business 
Principles and its associated policies and regulations, 
including the Human Rights Policy and the Supply Chain 
Sustainability Policy. 
Whistleblowing Channel 
In addition, the Telefónica Group has an Internal 
Information System, which includes the Whistleblowing 
Channel that Telefónica makes available to all its 
employees, executives and managers of its companies, 
as well as third parties, such as workers within the value 
chain. This allows them to report any information or 
situation that may constitute a potential irregularity or an 
act deemed to be in breach of the law or internal 
regulations.
For further information on the characteristics of these 
channels, including the principles of anonymity and 
accessibility, see:
 2.14.3.2. Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and 
Whistleblowing Channel
Processes
For further information about how the Queries Channel 
and the Whistleblowing Channel monitor the issues or 
complaints raised, ensure protection against reprisals for 
those who use them and guarantee the effectiveness of 
these mechanisms, see:
 2.14.3.2. Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and 
Whistleblowing Channel
In addition to identifying negative impacts through these 
channels, proactive measures are in place to address 
them via the annual audit plan. For further information, 
see Action Plan 4. On-site audits in the following section: 
 2.12.2.2. Action plans
S2-3_03
To improve the accessibility and awareness of this 
mechanism throughout the supply chain, the 
Sustainability Policy sets out the following supplier 
requirements:
• Promotion of the Queries Channel and the 
Whistleblowing Channel among workers and 
subcontractors. By doing so, the Company seeks to 
broaden the reach of this mechanism and ensure that 
the workers of its direct and indirect suppliers are 
aware of this mechanism for reporting potential non-
compliance.
• Training for workers and subcontractors on minimum 
social standards and the channels. This includes 
information on how to access the channels and the 
type of information that can be reported in line with 
the principles of confidentiality and 
comprehensiveness. 
• Implementation of internal procedures and standards 
that align with the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy. 
This entails integrating the policy’s requirements into

their own management systems, such as the 
availability of channels, and ensuring that their internal 
processes are aligned with Telefónica’s Responsible 
Business Principles.
S2-3_05
As part of its due diligence process, Telefónica carries 
out periodic human rights impact assessments. An 
integral part of these assessments consists of 
conducting interviews with various stakeholders, 
including proxies for workers in the value chain, to 
assess their awareness and trust in the Company's due 
diligence process, including these channels and 
remediation processes. These interviews are carried out 
by external experts without Telefónica's presence, and 
the final results are aggregated/anonymised to obtain 
the highest possible level of objectivity.
S2-2
2.12.2.4. Engagement with workers in the 
value chain
S2-2_01
The views of stakeholders are considered in the 
Company’s due diligence process. This includes global 
impact assessments, internal policy development and 
the creation of internal and external channels, among 
other areas. Further details about how these views are 
taken into account are provided below.
S2-2_02, S2-2_03 
Telefónica is unable to engage directly with third-party 
workers due to employment law constraints. However, 
Telefónica undertakes the following initiatives to identify 
the perspectives of workers in the value chain at various 
stages of the human rights management process:
S2-2_07
1. Worker interviews 
As part of on-site audits, interviews are conducted with 
workers at the factories of Telefónica's direct and 
indirect suppliers. The interviews are performed to 
ascertain worker views and concerns and to verify the 
information provided by the factory. 
Furthermore, as part of JAC, the sector initiative, 
employees are interviewed during each supplier audit, 
and in some cases, additionally via anonymous mobile 
surveys.
 S2-2_05
2. Global Framework Agreements (GFAs) 
Furthermore, each year, the Company uses Global 
Framework Agreements as a tool to promote the rights 
of workers in the value chain. Telefónica values the 
important role played by trade unions in defending the 
interests of workers and recognises the UNI (Global 
Union) and the European Works Council (EWC) as key 
partners in the management of international labour 
relations. The agreements in force with UNI and the 
EWC demonstrate the Company's commitment to 
respecting human rights, including the right of workers 
to freedom of association and collective bargaining, as 
well as to establishing a framework for continuous 
dialogue and cooperation with trade unions at a global 
level. 
Moreover, Telefónica is committed to promoting 
compliance with the standards established under these 
agreements by its main stakeholders, including the 
supply chain. 
The main aspects included in these agreements are the 
recognition and ratification of the commitment to 
fundamental human rights and respect for applicable 
standards in the areas of health and safety, equality, 
diversity and the environment in the workplace. These 
agreements enable the Company to better understand 
workers’ views, thanks to:
• Direct contact: regular and ongoing meetings and 
consultations with union representatives provide first-
hand information on workers’ experiences and 
concerns. They also allow the Company to 
comprehensively monitor potential incidents that may 
arise in different countries.
• Continuous improvement: the ongoing nature of 
Global Framework Agreements enables Telefónica to 
learn from and adapt to evolving worker needs and 
perspectives.
3. Dialogue with stakeholders 
 S2-2_06
As part of its regular impact assessments, Telefónica 
seeks to gather to the viewpoints of various stakeholders 
through proxies (such as NGOs, business partners, etc.) 
by conducting interviews at both global and local levels.
These interviews inform the gap analysis and the 
corresponding improvement plans that the Company 
implements to enhance its due diligence process.
These interviews help Telefónica assess the awareness 
and understanding among stakeholders of the 
Company’s policies, processes and channels. In this way, 
it seeks to assess the level of effectiveness of these 
stakeholder dialogue processes. 
Telefónica also participates in forums, associations and 
multi-stakeholder platforms to continuously gather 
information on stakeholder perspectives.
S2-2_04
The operational responsibility for fostering engagement 
with workers in the value chain depends on the subject 
matter. 
The responsibilities in this regard are shared among the 
Global Sustainability, Global People and Corporate 
Procurement Departments.
Furthermore, engagement with any stakeholder is part 
of the Responsible Business Plan approved by the 
Company’s Executive Committee, which bears ultimate 
responsibility for these matters.

2.12.3. Metrics and targets
2.12.3.1. Targets related to the management 
of material IROs
S2-5_01, S2-5_02, S2-5_03
To effectively manage the material IROs related to 
employees in the value chain outlined at the beginning 
of the chapter, and monitor the progress of the 
aforementioned key actions, Telefónica has set the 
targets detailed below.
These targets have been developed by the Company's 
internal experts who are in continuous contact with 
workers in the value chain, their legitimate 
representatives or credible spokespersons who are 
aware of their situation via the channels indicated in 
points 1, 2 and 3 of the previous section.
Moreover, through this ongoing engagement and 
reporting, these goals are also monitored and possible 
areas of improvement for the Company are identified. 
S2.MDR-T_01-13
Supply Chain Sustainability Policy
Target: ensure that 100% of the awarded suppliers 
accept the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy within the 
year as part of the Procurement Model applied across 
the Telefónica Group. 
By accepting the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, 
suppliers commit to complying with its clauses, including 
the obligation to undergo sustainability assessments and 
on-site audits at Telefónica's request. Acceptance of the 
policy therefore lays the groundwork for and facilitates 
implementation of actions '3. External sustainability 
assessments' and '4. On-site audits' detailed above. This 
target has thus been set in order to measure the scope 
of the requirement in relation to the supplier base in the 
Procurement Model.
The target level is 100% because these are minimum 
criteria that all must comply with. This is a quantifiable 
and relative target. The unit of measurement is the 
number of suppliers. 
The target does not have a past baseline year; it is 
measured annually. The target for this year includes all 
suppliers awarded through the procurement system 
with impact in the 2024 financial year. 
For further information about the progress of this target 
in 2024, see action '1. Contractual clauses' in the section 
'2.12.2.2. Action plans'.
Potential risk
Target: analyse the potential risk of all suppliers 
managed within the Procurement Model, based on 
Telefónica’s internal sustainability risk methodology. 
To implement actions '3. External sustainability 
assessments' and '4. On-site audits' as effectively as 
possible and comply with the Supply Chain 
Sustainability Policy, Telefónica adopts a risk-based 
approach. This approach is grounded in a prioritisation 
process based on action '2. Potential risk analysis', 
mentioned above, which allows the subsequent actions 
to be prioritised according to their different levels of risk. 
Therefore, suppliers with a potentially higher risk can be 
targeted with tailored actions that enable an effective 
approach. 
This target has been set in order to measure the scope 
of the potential internal risk analysis in relation to the 
supplier base in the procurement model.
The target level is 100% as it establishes which actions 
will be undertaken to manage the material IROs related 
to workers in the value chain. The unit of measurement 
is the number of suppliers analysed.
The target does not have a past baseline year; it is 
measured annually. The target for this year includes all 
suppliers awarded through the procurement system 
with impact in the 2024 financial year.
For further information about the progress of this target 
in 2024, see action 2. Potential risk analysis in the section 
2.12.2.2. Action plans.

2.13.1. Strategy
This chapter describes the mechanisms in place at 
Telefónica to maintain effective communication with 
consumers and end-users, along with the major policies 
implemented and actions performed to address various 
material impacts, risks and opportunities.
The two sub-subtopics identified as material are:  
• Privacy of consumer and end-user information.
• Access to products and services. In this area, due to 
the characteristics of the sector in general and of 
Telefónica in particular, the following issues have been 
defined and are specifically addressed in the chapter: 
◦Customer experience management, encompassing 
actions to promote effective customer service 
systems.  
◦Digital inclusion, which covers all the significant 
activities to facilitate customer access to digital 
services. 
◦Responsibility by Design of products and services, 
which addresses issues such as accessibility and 
control of risks associated with artificial intelligence 
(AI). 
◦Promotion of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, which 
includes actions directly related to fostering 
entrepreneurship and innovation.
◦Sale of cybersecurity services, which enable 
consumers and users to access services that protect 
them from the threats of the digital world.

Feedback and concerns of consumers and end-
users
Consumers and end-users are one of the Company’s key 
stakeholder groups, which is why Telefónica offers 
general and specific channels to gather their feedback 
and concerns, while respecting and promoting their 
human rights.
These expectations are incorporated into the Company's 
strategy and business model, as explained in the section: 
 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations
In addition, to mitigate both actual and potential 
negative impacts related to human rights, consumers 
and end-users have access to the Whistleblowing 
Channel and the Queries Channel, as explained in Due 
diligence phase 6:

business model
Types of consumers and end-users
S4.SBM-3_01
All types of consumers and users are considered during 
the materiality analysis process, as well as those groups 
of customers who may be more impacted by 
Telefónica’s activity due to certain circumstances.   
S4.SBM-3_02
Two major types of consumers and users have been 
defined:
• B2C (Business to Consumer) customers, also known 
as residential customers. These are individuals who 
gain the right to use and benefit from the services and 
products the Company provides through a contractual 
relationship with Telefónica.
• B2B (Business to Business) customers or corporate 
customers. These are legal entities that gain the right 
to use and benefit from the services and products the 
Company provides through a contractual relationship. 
S4.SBM-3_03
Within these two general types of consumers, three 
subcategories stand out as being particularly affected by 
the impacts analysed: 
• Consumers and users residing in rural, deprived or 
remote areas, who due to their geographical location 
may face challenges accessing quality communication

• Consumers and users with limited financial resources 
who, therefore, might struggle to bear the costs of the 
communication products and services offered 
(consumers or end-users who are particularly 
vulnerable to impacts from marketing and sales 
strategies).
• Consumers and users with a disability or older people

S4.SBM-3_05
The following stand out among the activities carried out 
that may positively impact consumers and end-users: 
• Deployment of broadband networks in urban and rural 
areas, fostering the economic and social development 
of customers by providing access to the benefits of 
the digital society (S4_IP01). 
• Activities undertaken to make the Company’s 
products, services and channels more accessible, and 
ensure the provision of affordable products. This helps 
to support the inclusion of consumers and users with 
disabilities or individuals with limited financial 
resources (S4_IP02).
• Fostering and supporting the entrepreneurial 
ecosystem coordinated by Telefónica’s open 
innovation unit (Wayra) and investing in incubation 
centres, allowing us to promote the development of 
new business initiatives (S4_IP03).
In general, the types of consumers or end-users who are 
or could be positively impacted would be all the 
organisation’s customers, both B2B and B2C, in all the 
regions and countries in which the Company operates. 
For the impacts related to inclusion (S4_IP01 and S4_IP02) 
specifically, those consumers who are particularly 
vulnerable due to their location, financial situation or 
disability can be highlighted. 
S4.SBM-3_07
In the various analyses conducted, no specific set of 
customers has been identified as being at greater risk of 
harm from the products and services Telefónica offers or 
the activities it undertakes. 
This analysis was conducted through the double-
materiality process, as a result of which the subtopic of 
the personal safety of consumers and end-users was 
found not to be material. 
However, subcategories of consumers that might be 
considered vulnerable have been identified, not because 
they are at risk of harm but due to the special difficulties 
they may encounter in accessing the communication 
services offered by Telefónica. 
S4.SBM-3_08
The opportunity to expand Telefónica’s business 
through network deployment in certain regions (S4_OP01) 
contributes positively to the socio-economic 
development of the consumers and users living in these 
regions, as they can make use of communication 
services and thereby access information and digital 
services. 
Moreover, to minimise the risk of restricted access to the 
Company’s products, services and channels (S4_RI03), 
they are adapted to enhance their accessibility. This 
facilitates access to communication and Internet 
services for groups of people with a disability, as well as 
older people and individuals without a legally recognised 
disability but who may have a temporary or situational 
disability.
Potential threats associated with biases in new AI 
services (S4_IN02), have also been considered. These 
could disproportionately impact certain socio-
demographic groups (older people or the very young, 
ethnic minorities and people with disabilities, among 
other groups). These groups may face discrimination if 
algorithms lack sufficient information and there is a lack 
of representation in the datasets used for AI training.

• Global Privacy Policy.
• Regulation of the Governance Model on Personal Data 
Protection.
• Regulation on Requests by Competent Authorities. 
• Telefónica’s Artificial Intelligence Principles: AI code of 
conduct.
• Regulation of the Governance Model on Artificial 
Intelligence.

 2.15. Policies
S4-1_01
While all the aforementioned policies affect the 
relationship with all consumers and users, the following 
stand out for the specific subgroups identified above:
• Responsible Business Principles.
• Global Human Rights Policy.
• Diversity and Inclusion Policy.
Human rights
S4-1_02
Telefónica’s commitment to human rights is set out in 
general terms in the Global Human Rights Policy. 
Regarding the issues identified as material, the following 
can be highlighted:
• Privacy: ensuring personal data is handled 
appropriately to respect individuals’ fundamental 
rights and freedoms and, specifically, the fundamental 
right to the protection of personal data. 
• Security: delivering secure and reliable infrastructure 
and services while protecting data by preventing its 
loss, modification, misuse or unauthorised access. 
• The development and responsible use of products and 
services: taking special care with value propositions, 
including those based on advanced technologies, 
incorporating due diligence processes throughout 
their development and application. 
The Global Human Rights Policy is based on the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights as well as other international agreements and 
commitments such as: the core conventions of the 
International Labour Organization and the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, among others. 
Point 4 of this policy includes and explains the due 
diligence process, which is the mechanism set out in the 
various international frameworks and conventions that is 
used to identify, prevent, mitigate and remedy adverse 
impacts.
S4-1_03
Telefónica strives to offer products and services that 
help create a positive impact on people’s lives. For this 
reason, it is committed to privacy, security, freedom of 
expression, the responsible development and use of 
products and services, the protection of minors and the 
non-discrimination of its consumers and end-users. 
The overall approach adopted by the Company 
concerning respect for the human rights of this 
stakeholder group is specifically outlined in the Global 
Human Rights Policy and the commitments included 
within it.
S4-1_04
The Company's engagement with consumers and end-
users is described in more detail in the next section of 
this chapter: 2.13.2.2. Engagement with consumers and 
end-users.
S4-1_05
To evaluate the impact on the human rights of 
consumers and users, Telefónica has a due diligence 
process in place that allows it to identify, assess, prevent 
and mitigate or remedy any adverse impacts that may be 
caused.
As a general approach to  prevent, mitigate or remedy 
any such impacts, the Whistleblowing Channel and the 
Queries Channel are made available to stakeholders. 
These channels facilitate the reporting of complaints or 
queries regarding actual or potential adverse human 
rights impacts that may occur among consumers and 
users as well as other stakeholders. 
All communications received are handled in accordance 
with the established internal procedures.
S4-1_06
The Global Human Rights Policy is aligned with 
internationally recognised instruments that are relevant 
to consumers or end-users.

This policy is based on the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights and the 
following international human rights conventions and 
commitments: 
• United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
• The United Nations Global Compact.
• The United Nations International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
• The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
• The core conventions of the International Labour 
Organization.
• The United Nations International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.
• The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the 
Child.
• The United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities. 
• The Principles of Freedom of Expression and Privacy 
of the Global Network Initiative (GNI).
These instruments outline the role that companies 
should play in respecting and promoting human rights. 
Telefónica has a Global Human Rights Policy, which 
formally sets out its commitment to these rights and also 
outlines the way in which impacts are managed through 
the due diligence process, explained in detail in Point 4 
of said policy.
S4-1_07
In 2024 no cases of non-compliance with the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
and Rights at Work or the OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises involving consumers or end-
users were reported in the downstream stages of the 
Company’s value chain.
S4-2
2.13.2.2. Engagement with consumers and 
end-users
S4-2_01, S4-2_02, S4-2_03
It is important to note that the views of consumers and 
end-users form the basis for decision making and the 
activities undertaken to manage material impacts.
A proactive and systematic approach is adopted to 
address and prevent material negative impacts that may 
affect them. 
Therefore, in general terms, there is ongoing contact and 
direct engagement with consumers and users during the 
marketing, service use and after-sales stages, through 
the various channels that the Company makes available 
to them (phone lines, website, and mobile applications, 
among others).  
Moreover, customer perception studies are conducted 
through regular surveys with Telefónica Group 
operators, which give an insight into their overall 
perception of the services offered. This information is 
shared with the Company’s main decision-making 
bodies and is an important factor in defining its strategy 
and business model. 
These surveys include questions on topics such as 
network quality, the commercial offering, the customer 
service available through various support channels and 
service pricing. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is derived 
from these surveys. This indicator helps ascertain 
consumer satisfaction and trust in Telefónica, key 
information for determining actions that help to identify 
and manage potential impacts. 
In relation to privacy and data protection, and in order to 
take into account the views of the Company’s 
customers, Fundación Telefónica annually prepares the 
Digital Society in Spain report. This report provides an 
overview of the extent of adoption and use of 
technology in Spanish society and examines key issues, 
such as the actions users take to manage their privacy 
and what percentage of consumers thoroughly read the 
privacy policies of the websites and applications they 
register with. 
Direct engagement with associations is performed 
throughout the year, either through direct relationships 
with certain organisations or by participating in initiatives 
they may implement. This includes initiatives related to 
associations representing people with disabilities or 
public and international organisations to promote 
responsible AI in the sector and society. This 
engagement is described later in this chapter. 
It is important to emphasise the fact that integrating the 
viewpoints of consumers and users enables the 
Company to have important information that guides 
practices and actions aimed at addressing potential 
impacts. 
S4-2_03 
Telefónica maintains a continuous relationship with its 
customers, as Company communication channels are 
always available to them, whether via telephone, the 
website or mobile applications. Feedback-gathering 
surveys are also conducted throughout the year in all 
the regions in which the Company operates. 
Regarding privacy, the focus is on establishing effective 
mechanisms for contacting those affected when any 
type of incident is detected. This may include notifying 
users of incidents, as well as offering personalised 
support to resolve queries or clarifications related to the 
breach.

The aim is to ensure that the affected person receives 
the appropriate information, should they request it, 
offering a thorough response to any situation affecting 
them personally.
Responsibility and evaluation of engagement 
processes
S4-2_04
Operational responsibility for consumer and user 
interactions depends on the specific subject matter.
In general, the Quality and Customer Experience 
Departments of each business unit oversee survey 
management, while the Channel Departments of each 
Telefónica Group operator are responsible for 
establishing and monitoring the various communication 
channels made available. 
Furthermore, the results of customer perception 
analyses and their associated action plans are submitted 
to the Company’s Executive Committee, which is 
ultimately responsible for these matters. 
S4-2_05
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of its consumer 
relationship processes and take consumer viewpoints 
into account, a target NPS (Net Promoter Score) 
indicator is defined annually for the Telefónica Group. 
This indicator is incorporated into the variable 
remuneration of employees who have this aspect 
included in their contractual conditions within the 
Group’s parent company (Telefónica S.A.) and the 
telecommunications operators in Spain, Germany, Brazil 
and Hispanoamerica.
This helps to ensure that the views and opinions of 
customers are considered at all levels of the Company. 
Based on the Company’s aim, Telefónica is committed to 
activities that prioritise improving the experience and 
satisfaction of consumers and end-users. 
S4-2_06
To understand the viewpoints of vulnerable consumers, 
a human rights impact assessment is conducted as part 
of the Due Diligence Process. Conducted in 
collaboration with the Company's key stakeholders, it 
includes the viewpoints of consumers or end-users.
Furthermore, to better understand their needs and to be 
able to address potential material impacts, Telefónica 
works with organisations that represent them or actively 
collaborate with them. 
In this regard, relationships are fostered with different 
associations representing people with disabilities. For 
example, in Spain the Group collaborates with CNSE, 
Fundación DKV Integralia and Fundación ONCE, among 
others. 
With regard to Fundación ONCE, Telefónica is a 
signatory of the INSERTA Agreement, which aims to 
promote the employment of people with disabilities and 
develop initiatives designed to contribute to improving 
their living conditions.
At an international level, the Company supports 
initiatives such as The Valuable 500, to which it is 
affiliated alongside other companies promoting and 
reinforcing disability inclusion on the global agenda, and 
the “Principles for Driving the Digital Inclusion of Persons 
with Disabilities”, promoted by the GSMA.
In relation to AI issues, agreements have been reached 
with entities such as the EU AI Office, UNESCO and 
GSMA to participate in global initiatives that promote 
frameworks and policies for the ethical adoption of AI. 
The Company also participates in the OECD’s AI working 
and expert groups. Through the ICC (International 
Chamber of Commerce of Spain), it has participated in 
the United Nations Global Digital Compact. These 
collaborations aim to mitigate risks and promote the 
responsible use of technology, benefiting all consumers 
and users, and especially the most vulnerable 
individuals.
S4-3
2.13.2.3. Remediation processes and 
engagement channels with consumers and 
end-users
S4-3_01
Telefónica takes a proactive approach to the 
remediation of material adverse impacts that may affect 
consumers and end-users. The process aimed at 
addressing this issue consists of the following stages:
• Receipt of the request: customer enquiries, comments 
or complaints are collected through the various 
available channels, then identified and categorised.
• Analysis of the information gathered: analysis tools are 
used to understand the tone, the level of satisfaction 
and common areas for improvement. Feedback is 
categorised and prioritised based on its severity, 
relevance and frequency, highlighting issues that 
require immediate attention.
• Assignment and escalation: the identified topics are 
referred to the relevant teams or departments.
• Corrective and proactive action: the responsible teams 
develop solutions or improvements based on the 
information received. In some cases, proactive 
measures may be implemented to prevent future 
problems, such as improvements to products or 
processes.
• Close the loop: lastly, the customer is contacted again 
to inform them about the actions taken. At this point, 
the customer is assured that their opinion is valued 
and taken into account.

Engagement channels
S4-3_02
As stated in Telefónica’s Responsible Business Principles 
in the section “Our Commitment to Customers”, assisted 
and unassisted channels have been made available to 
consumers and users to enable direct contact with 
them. These channels are the following:
Commercial channels
• Proprietary telephone channels.
• In-person channels, through Telefónica and third-
party shops. 
• Proprietary digital channels: 
◦Commercial websites and mobile applications, such 
as the self-management application “Mi Movistar” in 
Spain and Hispanoamerica.
◦In some cases, communication via social media. 
• Customer Defence Service in Spain, and Ouvidoria in 
Brazil. This is a proprietary second-instance channel 
that provides a review of the issue previously raised by 
a customer through the ordinary channels (telephone, 
in-person or digital channels).
Channels for privacy matters
In addition to the general channels, for matters related to 
consumer and user data privacy, the following means 
are available for submitting enquiries, complaints or any 
concerns relating to data processing: 
a) Telefónica’s own channels:
• Consumers can contact data protection mailboxes by 
letter, email or phone, as provided in the Company’s 
legal notices and privacy policies.
• Personalised assistance via contact mailboxes with 
the Data Protection Officers of Telefónica’s 
operations.
b) Participation in third-party mechanisms:
• Voluntary mediation system with AUTOCONTROL in 
Spain, through which customers can resolve claims 
related to data protection with telecommunications 
companies and receive a swift response. 
• Compliance with the AUTOCONTROL Code of 
Conduct on “Data Processing in Advertising Activities”, 
approved by the Spanish Data Protection Authority 
(AEPD), which provides a faster way to resolve citizen 
complaints relating to data protection and advertising.
Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and 
Whistleblowing Channel
In addition, Telefónica has a public Queries Channel on 
its institutional website, via which all stakeholders, 
including consumers, can enquire about any aspect 
related to the Responsible Business Principles. 
This channel allows for the reporting of queries related 
to compliance with the Responsible Business Principles 
and their associated policies and regulations, including 
the Human Rights Policy. 
This mechanism is subject to continuous improvement 
based on the effectiveness criteria set out in the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and related legislation. 
The Whistleblowing Channel is also made available to 
consumers, allowing them to report any potential 
irregularity or an act contrary to the law or internal 
regulations.
 2.14.3.2. Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and 
Whistleblowing Channel 
Availability of channels 
S4-3_03
Several lines of work are underway to improve the 
availability of these channels:
• Implementation and monitoring of technological 
systems.
• Facilitation of a variety of channels, allowing 
consumers to choose the most convenient method 
and time to get in touch. To enhance accessibility, 
widely used channels including social media and 
messaging platforms such as WhatsApp have been 
introduced.
• Training of customer service agents to meet customer 
needs and ensure they remain up to date. 
• Satisfaction surveys to evaluate the performance of 
agents and the channel being used.
• Audits to evaluate and confirm the smooth operation 
of the channels.
S4-3_04
Relationship surveys, alongside the NPS, provide 
additional indicators to assess customer satisfaction 
with service channels. 
The Customer Effort Score (CES) is specifically used to 
measure how easily consumers can carry out 
procedures through service channels. 
Furthermore, the Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), 
resulting from the satisfaction question asked in the 
transactional surveys (conducted at the end of each 
contact), is used for the management/remuneration of 
customer support service providers.
Privacy enquiries are received through the authorised 
channels and are managed in accordance with specific 
monitoring and response protocols, ensuring that

requests are dealt with in a timely manner. In 
accordance with the provisions of this protocol, one 
person is responsible for accessing the privacy channels 
daily, constantly monitoring all requests received. When 
requests involve the exercise of a right by the individual 
concerned, a detailed record is kept, including the type 
of right exercised, the date of receipt and the response 
date, ensuring compliance with established deadlines 
and proper management of requests.
In addition, there is a Stakeholder Rights Management 
Domain that all Group companies must uniformly follow. 
This framework includes the protocol to follow, 
standardising the way and the timeframe in which the 
Group companies respond to any such requests.
Lastly, it is important to highlight that information, 
parameters and indicators determined by local 
regulations are reported to the competent bodies in 
each market. Depending on the region, these may 
include specific information about complaints regarding 
the quality or the availability of the service provided.
S4-3_05
So that consumers and users are aware of the existence 
of these channels, information about how to contact 
Telefónica is publicly available on the Company’s 
website. This information is also promoted through 
various communication initiatives, both mass and 
personalised, as well as via different media.  
Transactional surveys are aimed at improving customer 
service. They are implemented in the main local 
operations (Spain, Brazil, Germany and Hispanoamerica) 
and conducted after customer contact to assess 
satisfaction with the response. In these surveys, 
customers can state whether they have found it difficult 
to contact the Company or whether they trust its 
channels to address their concerns or needs.
With regard to privacy matters, a Global Transparency 
Centre and Local Transparency Centres have been 
established for each of the operations. These centres 
provide stakeholders with direct access to clear, detailed 
and user-friendly information about how Telefónica 
handles the personal data of its customers. The 
Transparency Centre allows users to see what data are 
handled, how they can exercise their rights and what 
measures the Company takes to ensure compliance with 
privacy and data protection regulations.
Protection of confidentiality
S4-3_06
At Telefónica, protective measures are implemented to 
ensure confidentiality and privacy in the use of the 
Whistleblowing Channel, the main means for reporting 
significant issues that may require special protection for 
whistleblowers. 
This channel is governed by the principles of 
confidentiality, respect and sound reasoning, both in the 
analysis and verification of the communications received 
and in the resolution and adoption of corrective 
measures, where appropriate.
Any person who reports an issue in good faith will 
receive the appropriate protection in accordance with 
the regulations applicable to this channel. 
The Whistleblowing Channel ensures that those who 
wish to remain anonymous can do so with full 
protection. If the complainant voluntarily chooses to 
disclose their identity, the resolution report will avoid 
referencing their name or those of other involved parties 
to uphold confidentiality.
The protective measures are outlined in Telefónica’s 
Internal Information System Management Policy.

2.13.3. Action plans, metrics and targets
This section of the chapter has been divided into two 
parts, each describing the material sub-subtopics that 
were identified as a result of the materiality process:
a) Privacy.
b) Access to products and services.
Each of these sections includes information regarding 
actions associated with the impacts, risks and 
opportunities specific to each topic, as well as the 
established metrics and targets. 
A) Privacy 
These are the actions that Telefónica is working on to 
manage negative impacts (S4_IN01) and material risks 
(S4_RI01 and S4_RI02) in terms of privacy: 
1. Global privacy governance.
2.Privacy risk assessment.
3.Continuous cooperation with Security areas.
4.Transparency Centre.
5.Training and development.
Action plans
S4-4_01, S4-4_08, S4.MDR-A_01-12
At Telefónica, the following actions are undertaken to 
prevent, mitigate or remedy impacts, as well as to 
address risks concerning customer privacy: 
1. Global Privacy Governance: the Company has 
specialised privacy teams responsible for overseeing 
compliance with data protection policies. These teams 
operate under a Global Privacy Governance Model 
which establishes the strategic, organisational and 
operational framework for all activities related to data 
protection. This document is the point of reference for 
any aspects relating to the processing of personal data

at Telefónica, providing the foundation that underpins all 
the different procedures in this regard. 
Globally, Operational Domains are provided to 
standardise privacy protection across all Telefónica 
entities, ensuring consistent implementation of 
Company policies in every market in which it operates. In 
addition, Telefónica has Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) 
approved by the European data protection authorities. 
These ensure the lawful and secure transfer of personal 
data across Group companies, in adherence with the 
highest privacy and data protection standards.
2. Privacy risk assessment: a detailed record of data 
processing is kept on an internal platform dedicated to 
privacy management. A privacy risk analysis is 
conducted for each data processing operation in order 
to assess its potential impact and implement the 
necessary measures and controls to mitigate risks. 
Through this assessment, risks are identified and 
controls are implemented, alongside continuous 
monitoring to manage the impacts on customer privacy.
3. Continuous cooperation with Security areas: there is 
close collaboration with Security areas, particularly the 
Digital Security Department and the Incident Response 
Centre (Cybersecurity Incident Response Teams, 
CSIRTs), which are responsible for implementing 
measures aimed at preventing data security breaches, 
and identifying, mitigating and resolving them. This 
synergy helps us identify vulnerabilities in terms of 
privacy and to implement the appropriate technical 
controls. 
Incident response protocols have been developed in 
collaboration with the DPO’s Office and Security areas. 
These protocols establish the steps to follow to identify, 
evaluate and mitigate security incidents. In addition, the 
Global DPO Office manages a dedicated Personal data  
breaches Domain, which includes, among other things, 
detailed procedures for internal coordination in the 
event of incidents, protocols for communicating 
breaches to third parties and risk assessment 
procedures.
4. Transparency Centre: this is a centralised platform 
that has been developed and implemented, allowing 
customers to access, manage and control the data they 
generate when using the Company's products, services 
and those of its partners.
5. Training and development: privacy teams receive 
specialised training and participate in ongoing 
development programs, ensuring that the staff 
responsible for privacy management are always up to 
date. All employees receive training aimed at helping 
them understand and apply fundamental privacy 
principles.
All the aforementioned actions have a global scope, 
given that a privacy management system has been 
implemented at a global level, covering all the regions in 
which Telefónica operates, as well as an internal 
regulation that also applies globally. These activities are 
integrated into the product and service value chain, in 
the marketing, service use and after-sales stages.
The risk assessment system is now fully implemented in 
the internal compliance tool and ongoing cooperation 
with the Security areas is also fully established.
Similarly, Transparency Centres have been developed 
and implemented in all operations.
In terms of training and development, several courses on 
privacy for employees were delivered within the 
mandatory global training window throughout 2024, and 
they will continue to be developed in a similar manner in 
the coming years.
S4-4_02
In relation to privacy-related impacts, if any type of 
incident occurs, the Company assesses all associated 
risks to identify and understand potential repercussions. 
Telefónica focuses on establishing mechanisms for 
contacting those affected. This may include notifying 
users of incidents as well as offering personalised 
support to resolve queries or provide clarifications 
related to the breach. For more details regarding the 
remediation actions and how remediation is carried out, 
see datapoint S4-4_07 on the next page. 
These actions are tracked and monitored using various 
metrics. Further information can be found in the Metrics 
part of this section. 
S4-4_03
An additional initiative in the field of privacy that is aimed 
at positively contributing to the improvement of 
customers’ social outcomes, is the application of one of 
the Company's key principles when designing products: 
the Digital Privacy Framework (DPF). 
The DPF is Telefónica’s framework for the global legal 
and privacy strategy with respect to the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy 
regulation on data processing platform products and 
systems. In the DPF, the legal privacy compliance 
guidelines are adapted to a technological reality to 
standardise and conceptualise the functional and 
technical requirements of the dynamics of privacy 
systems, and apply them automatically and digitally in 
the processing of personal data. 
This digitalisation is implemented from the design phase 
and naturally enables a dynamic and automatic privacy 
process to be built between the customer and the 
systems that carry out the processing of personal data, 
as well as compliance with the GDPR.

The DPF was successfully integrated through the Kernel 
platform in Spain, Germany and Brazil, incorporating 
privacy by design in product development and all data 
processing and AI operations.  
Monitoring of initiatives
S4-4_04
With the aim of monitoring and assessing the 
effectiveness of the aforementioned actions and 
initiatives, the Company implements the following:
• Privacy Audits: conducted in accordance with the 
annual provisions of each Audit Plan to assess 
compliance with the data protection policies and 
procedures. These audits are carried out by the 
Internal Audit Department. Though these 
assessments, they identify, where appropriate, any 
issues and areas for improvement, and corresponding 
action plans are established. The implementation of 
these action plans is undertaken by the corresponding 
responsible management areas. Internal Audit 
monitors the plans, auditing, where appropriate, their 
correct implementation. In addition, there are other 
audits in the field of technology and cybersecurity that 
cover privacy aspects from the perspective of security 
measures. The working process, the publication of 
Internal Audit reports and the monitoring of the 
implementation of the pledged action plans are similar 
to those of specific privacy audits.
• Monitoring indicators: indicators are used to measure 
the effectiveness of the initiatives. These indicators 
help track the progress of Group companies. For 
example, they evaluate the number of records of 
processing activities created, the number of 
employees dedicated exclusively to privacy and the 
volume of requests to exercise rights received and 
dealt with. These metrics help to identify areas for 
improvement.
• Reports to the Audit and Control Committee (ACC): 
the Company provides regular reports to the ACC, 
which reviews the effectiveness of policies and risk 
management.
S4-4_05
To determine the necessary actions in response to a 
specific impact, a Personal data  breaches Domain  has 
been developed that details the process to follow in the 
event of any security incident that compromises 
personal data. 
This domain includes stages for assessing the breach, 
beginning with identifying and containing the incident, 
followed by an in-depth analysis to determine its nature 
and scope. 
Based on this assessment, the potential impact on 
stakeholders and the Company is evaluated. In addition, 
notification protocols are in place to ensure that 
stakeholders, including the relevant authorities, are 
informed promptly and in accordance with current 
regulations, if necessary.
S4-4_06
The Company takes a proactive approach to mitigating 
adverse impacts on consumers and users, implementing 
measures across multiple areas. For example, product 
design based on the principle of privacy by design, as 
already mentioned.
Other actions of note are:
• Opengateway: a GSMA-led telecommunications 
sector initiative that transforms networks into 
developer-ready platforms, unlocking their full 
potential. These capabilities are provided via global 
APIs with built-in privacy controls, managed by 
Telefónica to handle personal data for authorities and 
customers. 
• Retention Manager: Telefónica continues to adapt to 
the challenges and opportunities involved in managing 
big data. This year, the Company's data retention 
policies were automated through the Kernel platform, 
thereby enhancing regulatory compliance, operational 
efficiency and user privacy protection.
• ePrivacy: Kernel has facilitated the enhancement of 
digital privacy management through its ePrivacy 
capabilities. Unlike traditional approaches that focus 
on privacy at the device level, Kernel has implemented 
a customer-centred privacy management system, 
representing a breakthrough in the protection of 
digitalised personal data. Consistency is achieved 
across devices, as well as simplified control that allows 
customers to manage their privacy preferences from a 
single location.
S4-4_07
Risk analyses of incidents are conducted and mitigation 
measures to minimise their potential impact on 
individuals are implemented. This information is also 
shared with the data protection authorities whenever 
they require it. When data subjects are notified of a 
breach, they are also given recommendations to 
mitigate its potential impact, such as resetting their 
passwords. 
S4-4_10
The DPO is an independent figure responsible for 
ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. 
As the responsible party in this regard, the figure 
coordinates actions to manage personal data across the 
Group. Furthermore, they adhere to the Telefónica 
Group’s governance model, which establishes the 
strategic, organisational and operational framework for 
data protection initiatives, including the procedures that 
ensure regulatory compliance.
S4-4_11
In preparing the aforementioned information, the 
Company has taken into account whether any serious 
human rights issues or cases have been reported in

relation to its consumers or end-users. There is nothing 
to disclose, as none were identified in the 2024 financial 
year.
S4-4_12
Telefónica has specialised privacy teams responsible for 
overseeing compliance with its data protection policies. 
These teams operate under a Global Privacy 
Governance Model which establishes the strategic, 
organisational and operational framework for all 
activities related to data protection. 
SBM-3_08
Metrics and financial effects
The main metrics the Company uses to evaluate the 
performance and effectiveness of action plans related to 
the material impact and risks identified in terms of the 
privacy of its customers’ data are: 
• The total number of proceedings opened for privacy/
data protection issues with a sanction or customer 
complaint. 
Performance in 2024: 351.
• Total number of confirmed fines for privacy/data 
protection issues: final financial penalties in 
accordance with applicable local regulations, i.e. 
without the possibility of appeal, issued by a 
competent authority, which become final within the 
reporting year. 
Performance in 2024: 9.
• Total number of confirmed fines for privacy/data 
protection issues: total value of the final fines outlined 
in the previous paragraph. 
Performance in 2024: €1,009,252.
The methodology is based on a structured process led 
by the global DPO area, which has the goal of collecting 
key information about the Group’s main significant 
operations. The process begins with a request for 
specific data related to the metrics and the evidence 
supporting them. These metrics and evidence are, in 
turn, provided by the legal areas and are based on the 
files they manage, in order to compile accurate and 
traceable information.
Targets
 S4.MDR-T_14-19, S4-5_01, S4-5_02, S4-5_03  
Target-setting is not applicable due to the nature of this 
indicator, which depends on the variable nature of 
penalties and sanctioning procedures. These processes 
do not follow a fixed annual cycle and often extend over 
longer periods, making them difficult to align with 
predefined timeframes.
In addition, the criteria of the authorities change and 
new national regulations may emerge, as is the case in 
Brazil, Ecuador, or Chile, making these aspects difficult 
to predict. Meanwhile, the administrative and judicial 
processes involved in sanctioning procedures also 
introduce an additional variable, making it difficult to set 
specific goals.
B) Access to products and services  
These are the actions Telefónica is undertaking to 
manage negative impacts (S4_IN02, S4_IN03 and S4_IN04), 
material risks (S4_RI03) and opportunities (S4_OP01 and 
S4_OP02) in terms of access to products and services:
1. Deployment of connectivity and coverage with a focus 
on rural areas. 
2.Promotion of the affordability of basic communication 
services.
3.Fostering Responsibility by Design, integrating 
accessibility criteria and AI control into products and 
services.
4.Improving customer service and experience. 
5.Expanding the cybersecurity solutions portfolio. 
Action plans
S4-4_01
To mitigate the damage and prevent further impacts 
from the aspects identified in relation to digital inclusion 
(S4_IN04), the following lines of action have been pursued: 
1. Deployment of connectivity and coverage with a focus 
on rural areas. 
2.Promotion of the affordability of basic communication 
services through Universal Service Funds.
3.Fostering Responsibility by Design for Telefónica 
products, which involves integrating accessibility 
criteria into products and services.
For the negative impacts associated with the design of 
products and services (S4_IN03 and S4_IN02) the main action 
taken is encouraging Responsibility by Design, an 
initiative that integrates ethical and sustainability 
principles into product and service development, as well 
as overseeing AI-driven solutions. 
S4-4_08
The risk identified and associated with consumer 
experience and trust (S4_RI03) is addressed in a general 
way through the actions previously described, since all 
of them impact the generation of trust among 
consumers and end-users.
However, there is a specific action being developed to 
address this risk: customer service and experience. This 
initiative seeks to enhance the service consumers 
receive. 
To monitor the effectiveness of this action, daily post-
interaction surveys evaluate, inter alia, ease of service 
and customer satisfaction with the service and solution 
provided.

In addition, relational surveys, along with the 
recommendation, gather insights into customer 
perceptions of their overall experience with the 
Company.
S4-4_09
Lastly, it is important to highlight that some of the 
actions being undertaken to address impacts or risks 
also allow us to capitalise on identified material 
opportunities associated with digital inclusion topics, 
such as the deployment of connectivity (S4_OP01). This 
aims to mitigate harm and prevent the emergence of 
new impacts in previously unconnected areas or those 
where service could be improved, while simultaneously 
providing the opportunity to capture revenue in these 
areas.
In summary, taking into account the impacts, risks and 
opportunities, five actions stand out when it comes to 
preventing and mitigating risks and impacts while 
helping to seize emerging opportunities. These actions 
are as follows:
• Deployment of connectivity with a focus on rural 
areas. 
• Promoting the affordability of basic communication 
services so that individuals with fewer resources can 
access them.
• Responsibility by Design of products and services with 
the aim of preventing possible harm to customers and 
end-users, due, for example, to accessibility or ethical 
problems in the application of AI. 
• Customer service and experience to minimise the risk 
of a loss of trust through improved support and 
incident resolution.
• Expansion of the cybersecurity solutions portfolio to 
enhance trust and security in accessing the digital 
world.
S4.MDR-A_01-12
1. Deployment of connectivity and coverage
This action seeks to promote access to communication 
services and digital inclusion by deploying connectivity 
and coverage.
Fixed and mobile networks are being rolled out to 
maximise their availability across all regions. This is 
achieved through coverage and infrastructure 
expansion plans, some via agreements with third parties 
to extend mobile broadband and fibre services. 
Simultaneously, networks are being upgraded and 
expanded with cutting-edge technologies to provide 
ultra-broadband services.
Connectivity deployment activities are carried out by the 
Company's telecommunications operators (Spain, 
Germany, Brazil and Hispanoamerica) and directly 
impact all their customers.
Bridging the digital divide is an ongoing effort without a 
fixed timeframe, since technological advances make it 
possible to adapt strategies and increase ambition over 
time.
For this reason, the plans and actions associated with 
the deployment of connectivity, both in urban and rural 
areas, have been developed over several years. As this is 
an ongoing activity, it is expected that they will continue 
to evolve in the coming years.
S4-4_02
This deployment of coverage and connectivity is the 
main action taken to remedy or mitigate the negative 
impact that the digital divide can cause (S4_IN04) in places 
where connectivity is limited or non-existent.
The remaining impacts have not materialised. Telefónica 
proactively identifies and mitigates risks before they 
affect consumers and users.
The actions performed as part of the deployment of 
coverage are assessed to evaluate progress and 
whether they are adequately addressing the associated 
risks and impacts. To assess the deployment of 
connectivity, the Company monitors mobile broadband 
coverage and deployment in the main countries in which 
it operates. 
The targets and metrics section contains detailed 
quantitative data on the deployment of connectivity.
Resources allocated to actions related to the 
deployment of connectivity and coverage
The CapEx investment made in 2024 to improve 
broadband coverage related to access to Products and 
Services is included in the Network Transformation 
CapEx investment disclosed in Chapter 2.9. ESRS E1 - 
Climate Change. The extension of broadband coverage 
is carried out using 4G/5G and FTTH technologies, 
which are part of the concept of Network 
Transformation.
 2.9. ESRS E1 - Climate change
2. Affordability
Contributions to the Universal Service Fund seek to 
ensure affordable network access for low-income 
individuals, reducing or preventing social exclusion 
(S4_IN04).
To achieve this, designated public bodies in each 
country establish funding mechanisms to cover 
Universal Service costs and appoint service providers. 
In that context, Telefónica contributes to these funds 
whose objective is ensuring affordable fixed connection 
services for all users, regardless of location, while 
maintaining quality standards. The management of the 
fund is overseen by the public bodies designated for this 
purpose in each country.

In 2024, the contribution focused on Argentina, Brazil, 
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, during the 
product and service operations and marketing stages.
As noted earlier, bridging the digital divide (S4_IN04) is an 
ongoing effort with no fixed timeline. For this reason, it is 
expected that the contribution to the Universal Service 
Fund that has been developed over recent years will 
continue in the years to come.
S4-4_02
The Universal Fund is a tool that helps to partially 
remedy or mitigate the negative impact that the cost of 
services can have on consumers and users with fewer 
resources (S4_IN04).
Progress with the Universal Service Fund is tracked by 
monitoring annual contributions and recipient countries. 
The targets and metrics section contains detailed 
quantitative data on the Service Fund. The contribution 
is reflected in the amount provided in 2024 by the 
Company in the different markets.
Resources allocated to actions related to affordability
In 2024, Telefónica made a contribution to the Universal 
Service Fund. The amount contributed is detailed in the 
Metrics and objectives section of this chapter.
3. Responsibility by Design
The Responsibility by Design project aims to drive 
sustainable innovation through an internal framework 
that integrates ethical and sustainability principles into 
product and service development. 
The goal is to mitigate or prevent potential harm or 
negative impacts (S4_IN03) to customers and end-users 
due, for example, to accessibility issues or biases in 
systems that incorporate AI (S4_IN02). To achieve this, the 
Company’s products and services are evaluated to 
ensure compliance with established ethical and 
sustainability requirements.
The Responsibility by Design framework is based on four 
pillars:  
• Assessing environmental factors to minimise 
environmental impact.
• Assessing accessibility criteria across products, 
services and channels. 
• Assessing transparency criteria and digital rights to 
ensure accountability in customer communication 
processes.
• Assessing criteria that ensure an ethical and 
responsible use of AI to prevent negative impacts in 
relation to risks such as discrimination and biases. 
Employees also receive training on accessibility, ethics 
and AI to complement assessment activities. 
In 2024, two activities were developed as part of the 
Responsibility by Design project: 
• Update of the accessibility assessment model.
• A governance and control model for AI systems to 
prevent bias. 
Regarding the first, the framework for evaluating 
accessibility requirements, based on the European Union 
Accessibility Directive, has been updated. Efforts are 
being made to create an equal user experience by 
improving accessibility across service and 
communication channels. 
Accessibility activities are mainly being carried out in 
Spain, Brazil and Germany.
With regard to aspects related to the prevention of bias 
in AI systems, the Company has established an AI 
Governance model with control processes applicable 
across the Telefónica Group. This year, efforts focused 
on Telefónica Spain, Brazil, Germany, Hispanoamerica, 
and the global units of Telefónica S.A., Telefónica Tech 
and Telefónica Innovación Digital.
Telefónica’s Responsible AI Principles are applied from 
the design stage and throughout the entire value chain, 
addressing aspects such as the detection of biases, 
potential negative discrimination and transparency, 
among others, in the creation or evolution of any AI-
based product or service. The Company takes a 
systematic approach to addressing potential AI-driven 
discrimination that could affect consumers and end-
users. This process is based on the Responsible AI 
Governance model, which includes a system for 
recording, reviewing and assessing the risks of use 
cases. Each potential impact is analysed to prevent this 
potential risk from materialising in the form of 
discrimination with a negative impact on consumers.
Furthermore, over the course of this year, the training 
program has been enhanced in terms of both 
accessibility and artificial intelligence.
A Company-wide accessibility course has been 
launched. Specific trainings have also been provided to 
employees of Telefónica Innovación Digital S.L., 
Telefónica S.A. and Telefónica Spain. In particular, 
accessibility training has been provided to product 
managers, developers, designers, brand teams and other 
professionals involved in the development of digital 
services.
In 2024, training sessions on responsible AI use were 
delivered globally and across the countries in which the 
Company operates: 
• Courses aimed at employees, in general, to raise 
awareness about the responsible use of AI and to 
provide in-depth knowledge of the Company's code of

conduct and governance model through the 
Telefónica Corporate University (Universitas).
• Awareness-raising sessions in business areas to 
promote ethical and responsible development when 
creating products and services with AI.
• A dedicated training program for RAI Champions 
(Responsible Artificial Intelligence Champions), ho are 
responsible for ensuring responsible AI in each 
business unit.
The implementation of Responsibility by Design is still in 
its early stages, and is set to continue evolving over the 
coming years. 
Specifically, with regard to AI control systems and the 
development of registration tools in particular, future 
plans include incorporating new features, such as 
process enhancements and automation.
In 2025, there are plans to expand AI and accessibility 
training, focusing on technical tools for detecting and 
mitigating AI risks and improving digital accessibility.
With regard to the progress of Responsibility by Design 
and, more specifically, the topics of accessibility and AI 
control, quantitative indicators have not been defined, 
although products and services are being monitored and 
assessed. 
Over the past year, six strategic products covering 
various technologies were assessed, including 
customer-premises equipment, devices, video platforms, 
mobile applications, web applications and websites. 
Furthermore, a systematic approach has been 
developed in relation to AI in order to monitor and assess 
the effectiveness of measures implemented to prevent 
potential negative impacts arising in the form of 
discrimination. 
This process is based on the Responsible AI Governance 
model, which includes a system for recording, reviewing 
and assessing the risks of AI use cases. 
Each potential impact is analysed through this recording 
tool to prevent this potential risk from materialising in the 
form of discrimination with a negative impact on 
consumers or customers. 
Supervision of employee training and awareness-raising 
activities about accessibility and responsible AI is also 
carried out. Specifically, specialised training in 
methodologies for detecting and mitigating risks related 
to AI discrimination and bias is provided for the roles 
designated to implement the AI Governance Model 
Regulation across the different areas.
4. Customer service and experience
This initiative aims to enhance customer service and 
experience while reducing the risk of loss of trust by 
personalising service processes (S4_RI03). 
To this end, work is being carried out on customer 
service processes, ensuring that the customer is 
satisfied with the resolution provided in each of their 
interactions via Company channels. Customer feedback 
is reviewed to identify areas for improvement and 
implement necessary changes.
For this to be possible, customer feedback tools have 
been implemented at the main points of contact, in order 
to: 
• Identify the most critical processes where immediate 
action can be taken to improve the customer 
experience. 
• Distribute the feedback obtained to all areas involved 
in the customer experience.
• Integrate all the information into a single platform with 
different capacities for quantitative analysis through 
multiple variables that make it possible to take a 
deeper look at root causes.
• Analyse customer information to gain a better 
understanding of Company strengths and 
opportunities for improvement, so as to use this 
information to guide projects.
• Seek to provide a response to the incident raised after 
the interaction through one of the contact channels, 
and use the information collected as feedback to 
prioritise structural improvements in the Company’s 
processes, thereby preventing this incident from 
affecting other customers in the future. 
These actions to improve customer service processes 
have already been implemented and are operational, 
with varying degrees of progress, in the businesses in 
Spain, Germany, Brazil and Telefónica’s operations in 
Hispanoamerica. 
Moreover, these actions to improve the customer 
experience are expected to continue to develop in the 
coming years. 
The Net Promoter Score (NPS) indicator is used to 
monitor consumer satisfaction and experience. This 
indicator has been measured since 2017 and has grown 
in recent years to reach a value of 33 in 2024.  
The targets and metrics section contains more detailed 
quantitative data on the NPS indicator.

(S4_OP02). The following activities have been outlined as 
part of this action: 
• Implementation of technological infrastructure: 
through the Telefónica Tech business unit, the DOC 
(Digital Operations Centre) and a Global Network of 
Security Operations Centres (SOCs) are made 
available to provide cybersecurity and cloud 
monitoring and operation services. The intelligence 
teams of these units provide managed services on a 
global scale, helping to identify, detect, prevent and 
recover from cyberattacks. Furthermore, operations 
include continuous monitoring of threats and 
vulnerabilities through a centralised platform and use 
AI and machine learning technologies to proactively 
detect cyber threats.
• Strategic partnerships and collaborations with security 
software companies, cloud infrastructure providers 
and advanced cybersecurity solutions, as well as 
participation in governmental security initiatives and 
standards, facilitating compliance with local and 
international regulations.
• Network Security: NaaS (Network as a Service) 
solutions offer a scalable and secure network 
infrastructure. By implementing SASE (Secure Access 
Service Edge) solutions, the transition from networks 
to the cloud is streamlined, boosting performance and 
security, safeguarding valuable assets for consumers 
and users.
• Security by design: security is prioritised from the 
design phase, promoting the incorporation of 
cybersecurity principles at every stage of the product 
life cycle, from conceptualisation to implementation 
and maintenance, with the aim of preventing harm to 
customers and end-users.  
• Cybersecurity training, skills development and 
awareness-raising: courses and workshops are offered 
to both companies and end-users on the prevention of 
cyberattacks and best practices for protecting data 
and devices. Educational content has been created to 
raise awareness about the risks and benefits of 
cybersecurity. Expert consultants also provide 
recommendations and solutions.
Cybersecurity activities are conducted at Telefónica 
Tech and at the Group’s telecommunications operators. 
They are aimed at all customers, in both the business 
and residential segments (B2B and B2C). 
Telefónica Tech has established regional business units 
in Spain, America, the United Kingdom, Ireland and 
Central Europe. It also has a cross-cutting cybersecurity 
services unit. 
Notably, cybersecurity has become an increasing 
concern as digitalisation advances in all sectors of 
society. Both businesses and consumers face an 
increasingly complex landscape of threats, ranging from 
ransomware attacks and data theft to vulnerabilities in 
connected devices. This situation is compounded by the 
increase in remote working, e-commerce and the 
widespread use of cloud services, which broadens the 
area exposed to cyber risks. 
For this reason, the protection of information, privacy 
and the integrity of digital systems is essential for the 
continuity of operations and to build trust in an 
increasingly interconnected environment. The plans and 
actions linked to cybersecurity were developed 
throughout 2024 and are expected to continue evolving 
in subsequent years.
Additional initiatives
S4-4_03
In addition to the potential negative impacts described 
as part of the activities and initiatives developed, it has 
also been found that the Company's activity can 
generate positive impacts that can add value for 
consumers and end-users. 
Among the initiatives developed with the aim of making 
such a positive contribution, the following can be 
highlighted: 
• Fostering the economic and social development of 
local communities (mainly of customers) by providing 
access to a network that helps them access the 
benefits offered by the digital society (S4_IP01).
• Promoting the socio-economic inclusion of consumers 
and users with disabilities, as well as people with 
limited financial resources, by providing an accessible 
and affordable range of connectivity and digital 
services (S4_IP02).
• Promotion and support for the entrepreneurial 
ecosystem, as well as ongoing investment in 
incubation centres for the launch of new business 
initiatives (S4_IP03).
In relation to the socio-economic development driven by 
the deployment of coverage in local communities 
(S4_IP01), the Company has developed new business 
models that help to deploy networks in rural areas with 
low population density or access difficulties, thereby 
facilitating universal access to communication services. 
To achieve this, it is sometimes necessary to collaborate 
with third parties that facilitate the expansion of 
coverage and infrastructure.
In addition, promoting the accessibility of Telefónica 
products (S4_IP02) helps an increasing number of people 
gain access to these services.
To support the entrepreneurial ecosystem and drive 
business development (S4_IP03), Telefónica invests in

startups while adhering to sustainability criteria. This 
activity is managed by a specialised unit, Wayra, which 
invests in seed and growth-stage startups across more 
than 10 countries, mainly in Europe and Latin America. 
Investments are made either directly in startups or 
through investment funds in which Telefónica acts as a 
Limited Partner (LP).  
To promote the positive impact of entrepreneurship 
(S4_IP03), an Investment Committee regularly monitors all 
investments, which are also reviewed by the 
Compliance department. 
Furthermore, since February 2024, the Company has 
been a signatory to the United Nations Principles for 
Responsible Investment (UN PRI), which entails 
integrating ESG targets and factors into all its 
investment decisions.
The monitoring data for Company investments in 2024 
are as follows:
• 1,168 startups invested in by Wayra through direct 
investment and funds.
• 948 startups directly invested in by Wayra.
• 237 startups invested in by Wayra through funds.
Monitoring of initiatives
S4-4_04
The effectiveness of initiatives to improve access to 
products and services is generally measured through 
consumer satisfaction and experience analyses.
Alongside the NPS indicator, additional metrics track key 
factors such as network quality perception and service 
performance across Company channels. 
Some of the activities are monitored and assessed 
through specific indicators. Network coverage initiatives 
are assessed using mobile and fixed broadband 
coverage indicators, as well as the rural mobile 
broadband coverage indicators. Affordability is 
evaluated based on contributions to the Universal 
Service Fund. Product assessments conducted as part 
of the Responsibility by Design initiative and systems 
incorporating AI are also monitored.
S4-4_05
To identify the necessary actions for responding to 
consumers and end-users, whether in the face of a 
commercial query, complaint or a potential negative 
impact, the Company follows the general incident 
management and resolution process described above. 
This process covers the entire journey from receiving a 
customer enquiry to evaluating the resolution provided, 
and includes the analysis and involvement of the 
relevant departments that need to respond to the 
customer concerns.
S4-4_06
Regardless of the approach taken to address any given 
type of impact, Telefónica adopts a proactive approach 
to prevent material negative impacts on consumers or 
end-users.
To this end, the Company implements evaluation and 
control measures, including the Responsibility by Design 
initiative, AI system oversight, contributions to funds that 
promote access to basic communication services for 
low-income individuals and enhanced customer support 
across the Group’s channels. 
S4-4_07
There are several ways to ensure that the processes 
developed are available and function properly: 
• Regular surveys evaluate the effectiveness of 
customer service channels to ensure that both they 
and the service provided meet consumer needs. The 
Customer Effort indicator is used to gauge how easily 
consumers carry out procedures via Company 
channels.
• In addition, in the transactional surveys conducted 
after each contact through the service channels, the 
customer is asked, among other things, if their query 
has been resolved. If this is not the case, after carrying 
out the necessary internal management process to 
respond to the enquiry, contact is made again to 
communicate the resolution and assess the 
corresponding satisfaction levels. 
• For the remaining channels, in cases where a 
customer has got in contact to escalate an issue, they 
are contacted upon resolution to inform them of the 
actions taken.
S4-4_10
To ensure that the Group's activities do not have a 
negative impact on consumers and users, preventative 
actions have been established, primarily related to the 
development of models to assess and control risks, such 
as those that AI may generate. 
Within the Responsibility by Design framework, products 
and services—whether in development or already on the 
market—are evaluated for compliance in key areas such 
as customer responsibility, AI, accessibility and 
environmental impact, with a maturity score assigned 
accordingly. 
S4-4_12 
The resources allocated to managing negative impacts 
are as follows:
• To address the impacts associated with the digital 
divide, as this is an organisation-wide activity, no 
specific resource is defined; rather, it is addressed by 
the different units within the Company. 
• Resources addressing Access to Products and 
Services impacts are managed through the 
Responsibility by Design project, led by the Global

departments.
• In relation to AI, there is a team of experts in this field 
within Telefónica's Digital Innovation unit. Moreover, 
designated “champions” in product and service 
development oversee key topics such as AI. These 
champions receive specialised training to acquire the 
necessary knowledge in these disciplines. This enables 
them to advise the other employees in their areas that 
are involved in developing products and services in 
order to ensure compliance with established 
requirements.
Metrics and Targets
S4.MDR-T_01-13, S4-5_01, S4-5_02, S4-5_03 
Digital inclusion
The main metrics used by the Company to evaluate the 
performance and effectiveness of action plans related to 
the impact, risks and opportunities identified in terms of 
access to products and services, and specifically in 
connection with digital inclusion issues, are as follows: 
The following aspects are monitored to assess 
connectivity deployment:
• Fixed and mobile broadband coverage across the 
countries in which Telefónica operates.
• Mobile broadband coverage in the rural areas of the 
main countries in which Telefónica operates. 
4G coverage

The deployment of 5G coverage in the Telefónica 
Hispanoamerica business unit is at an incipient stage 
due to exogenous reasons, mainly the later execution of 
spectrum auctions by national regulators compared to 
regulators in the rest of the countries where the 
Company is present, with execution even pending in 
some countries.
Premises with fibre-to-the-home [FTTH] 
connections

Group
79,925,100
Rural mobile broadband coverage
2024
Germany
 99.4% 
Brazil
 83.5% 
Spain
 95.0% 
Regarding rural coverage, it has not been possible to 
provide data for Telefónica Hispanoamerica due to the 
absence of comparable references from the competent 
authorities in the countries included in the region. The 
Company is working to provide this information as soon 
as possible.
Telefónica tracks its contributions to the Universal 
Service Fund by country and amount. In 2024, the Group 
contributed €138 million to the Universal Service Fund. 
Quantifying the impact of this fund on society is beyond 
the Company’s control, as its management falls to the 
various public administrations of the countries where the 
contribution is made.
The population coverage of mobile broadband (4G and 
5G) is calculated using national criteria for network 
coverage planning in the country in question. It attempts 
to determine the percentage of the country’s total 
population that can access the operator's mobile 
services for a given technology. 
In the case of the rural mobile broadband coverage 
indicator, the areas on which it is calculated are limited 
according to the “rurality” criteria specified by each 
national regulator. Therefore, the calculation is carried 
out exclusively on these rural areas. 
The FTTH premises are the number of premises in a 
country that have access to the FTTH service. In other 
words, once a customer requests service activation, only 
a final installation of the CPE (customer-premises 
equipment) is required and, when necessary, the last 
section of fibre cabling from the terminal box.
Connectivity penetration and network quality targets 
have been set, as these deployments contribute to 
socio-economic development, as previously mentioned. 
The goals relate to the fixed and mobile broadband 
coverage indicators in the countries in which the 
Company operates:
• Fixed broadband: premises with FTTH connections.
• Mobile broadband: percentage of 5G coverage.
Target: to reach 90 million premises with FTTH by 2026. 
The goal is absolute and is measured in the number of 
premises reached by FTTH.
Performance in 2024: the number of premises reached 
by FTTH was 80 million, compared to 72 million in 2023.

This target applies globally, covering operations in Spain, 
Germany, Brazil and Hispanoamerica.
The fibre network deployment target uses 2023 as the 
baseline year. At that time, 72 million premises had an 
FTTH connection. The target is set for 2026, with no 
interim milestones.
The 5G coverage percentage indicates the proportion of 
the population with access to 5G mobile services. 
Specifically, the indicator determines the percentage of 
the country’s total population that can access the 
operator's mobile services for a given technology.
Target: achieve the following 5G SA (Stand-Alone) 
network coverage by 2026:
• Spain: 90%
• Brazil: 60%
• Germany: 99%
Performance in 2024: Telefónica’s 5G network coverage 
increased to 90.8% in Spain, 61.1% in Brazil and 97.2% in 
Germany. Due to the network rollout in 2024, the target 
has been met two years ahead of schedule in Spain and 
Brazil.
Local 5G SA deployment targets are relative and 
measured as a percentage of each country’s total 
resident population. These targets apply locally to Spain, 
Brazil and Germany.
The baseline measurement is from 2023. At that time, 
coverage stood at 87% in Spain, 48% in Brazil and 94% in 
Germany. The target is set for 2026, with no interim 
milestones.
For both targets, the Company’s local Network Strategy 
and Planning teams, in collaboration with commercial 
teams, define the network deployment goals for the 
coming years.
Progress towards the target is assessed monthly. 
Regular monitoring ensures progress towards these 
targets, allowing for adjustments if progress is not being 
made as expected.
Since these targets were set in 2023, the associated 
indicators have progressed well, and they are expected 
to be met within the projected timeframe.
Mobile network coverage indicators and fibre 
deployment metrics are based on population coverage 
estimation models, including mobile footprint and fibre 
premises coverage.
These targets align with:
• The Responsible Business Principles, particularly the 
commitment to customers. 
• The commitment outlined in the Global Human Rights 
Policy, “to promote access to connectivity through 
collaborations on initiatives that enhance connectivity 
in remote or hard-to-reach areas”.
Methodology: the approach to target-setting and 
tracking coverage indicators is developed internally.
Population coverage (4G and 5G) is calculated using 
local network planning tools that determine signal 
strength across geographical areas. These data are then 
cross-referenced with population distribution by region 
to determine the total population covered by each 
technology (4G or 5G) at a specified minimum signal 
level.
For premises with a FTTH connection, local network 
planning tools are also used to identify covered 
geographical locations. These data are then compared 
with the total number of premises in each area to 
determine overall FTTH coverage.
Lastly, it should be noted that customers do not 
participate in setting these targets. 
Consumer and user satisfaction
The NPS metric is used to track customer satisfaction. 
This metric measures the consumer and user 
experience. Telefónica has been monitoring it since 
2017, when it was established as a target linked to the 
variable remuneration of the Company’s employees who 
receive this type of remuneration. It also forms part of 
the strategic plan.
The NPS helps to assess the recommendation of 
products and services. The Group's NPS is calculated on 
the basis of the results obtained in each of its operations 
(Spain, Germany, Brazil and Hispanoamerica).
Telefónica NPS
2024
Group NPS
33
B2C NPS

B2B NPS

The NPS is calculated using customer relationship 
surveys that ask whether customers would recommend 
Telefónica. The result is calculated by subtracting from 
the percentage of promoters (ratings 9-10) the 
percentage of detractors (ratings 1-6).
These surveys are conducted monthly for both the B2C 
and B2B customers of telecommunications operators in 
Spain, Brazil, Germany and Hispanoamerica.
In these studies, customers are asked about the quality 
of the network, the commercial offering, the customer 
service provided through various channels, bills, mobile 
top-ups and prices, among other things.

Among other indicators, these surveys provide the NPS. 
Subsequently, each operation consolidates its NPS at 
the country level, with the result given by B2C and B2B 
segment. It is then aggregated at the Telefónica Group 
level for evaluation against the annual target.
Target: increase the Net Promoter Score (NPS) each 
year. 
The trend of the indicator in recent years has been 
positive. 
Performance in 2024: the NPS growth target compared 
to 2023 was achieved. The result for the year is provided 
in the previous section, Metrics.
Indicator methodology: the methodology for defining the 
target and monitoring is defined and developed 
internally.
The NPS methodology is based on daily surveys 
conducted via telephone, digital or in-person channels, 
which ask customers how likely they are to recommend 
the Company’s services, from which the final value of 
the indicator is obtained.
NPS measurement undergoes both internal validation 
and external auditing through a dual assurance process. 
This provides reasonable assurance for the Telefónica 
Group’s results, which include operations in Spain, 
Germany and Brazil. 
The NPS target aligns with:
• The Responsible Business Principles, particularly the 
commitment to customers. 
Customers do not participate in setting these targets. 
However, the results of the satisfaction assessment 
surveys are indeed the source for setting the annual 
target each year. To this end, methodological aspects 
contained in the Telefónica Group’s Quality Manual and 
business inputs are considered. 
This methodology is based on the internationally 
established definition for the NPS indicator and is 
tailored to Telefónica’s specific characteristics for 
weighting by region and segment. To achieve this: 
• The calculation scope is defined, covering customer 
segments, legal entities and commercial brands. 
• The weightings or the calculation formula used to 
consolidate the KPI at Group level are defined.
The business inputs considered include: 
• The trend of the business unit indicator in recent 
years. 
• The latest available actual data and/or the forecast for 
the end of the current year.
• Telefónica's own initiatives and those of the 
competition, which the countries include in their 
action plans.
• Correlation analysis of how various factors—such as 
network performance, service offerings, customer 
service and pricing—impact NPS trends.

2.14.1. Governance
G1.GOV-1_01
The Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. approves the 
Group’s Responsible Business Principles. These 
principles constitute the Group's code of ethics and 
conduct, guiding the Group’s daily activities, whether 
carried out individually or as a team. They also form the 
basis of the Sustainability Policy. 
The Global Sustainability (ESG) Department is the area 
responsible for updating the Company’s Sustainability 
and Regulation Committee regarding the 
implementation of the Responsible Business Plan during 
monthly meetings. 
The aforementioned Responsible Business Principles are 
structured around 10 topics, with the following standing 
out in relation to corporate culture:
(i) Ethical and responsible management: at Telefónica all 
employees are required to work ethically and 
responsibly, leading to consistent behaviours aligned 
with strict legal compliance; zero tolerance for 
corruption and bribery; a firm commitment to 
transparency, the protection of data and business 
assets, the non-use of insider information, fair 
competition and remaining politically neutral. 
(ii) Responsible supply chain management: Telefónica is 
committed to acting with rigour, objectivity, 
transparency and professionalism in its relationships 
with business partners and suppliers, requiring them to 
meet the minimum responsible business criteria of the 
Telefónica Group in order to fulfil its commitment to 
responsibility throughout the value chain. 
Telefónica’s Compliance Department, through the Chief 
Compliance Officer, is the area responsible for regularly 
reporting to the Company's Audit and Control 
Committee on the main aspects of the Telefónica 
Group’s compliance program, including the Group’s 
practices regarding integrity and the fight against 
corruption and bribery. Likewise, on a quarterly basis, it 
reports directly to the Board of Directors on the activity 
report of the Telefónica Group’s Compliance 
Department.
Moreover, the Global Sustainability (ESG) Department 
reports annually to the Company’s Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee on the management of matters 
related to sustainability. In addition to the Global 
Sustainability Department, management areas such as 
Purchasing, People, etc., are responsible for the 
sustainable management of the supply chain.
In relation to the Company's activities and commitments 
with pressure groups, the Regulation, Competition and 
Public Policy Department regularly reports on these 
topics to the Company’s Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee.    
In addition, the Chairs of the Audit and Control 
Committee and the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee report the main issues discussed at their 
respective meetings to the Board of Directors meetings, 
helping to ensure that the most significant business 
conduct issues are taken into consideration in the 
deliberations of the Board of Directors.
Following a favourable report from the corresponding 
Committees, the Board of Directors is also responsible 
for approving corporate policies on relevant matters 
related to the Responsible Business Principles and, in 
particular, to business conduct, the Anti-Corruption 
Policy and the Supply Chain Sustainability Policy, among 
others.
Details of these policies can be found in the following 
section of the Sustainability notes:

In addition, Telefónica offers all members of the Board of 
Directors continuous training and refresher programs on 
aspects that are particularly important to the 
performance of their duties. 
Specifically, in recent years, training and information 
sessions have been developed for the members of the 
Board of Directors and the Board Committees by 
external consultants and internal teams. 
The Company also has a process for onboarding new 
directors, who are provided with an induction pack 
containing relevant information about the Company, in 
order to equip new members of the Board of Directors or 
its Committees with the support necessary to quickly 
gain a thorough understanding of the Company and its 
Group, so that they can actively perform their duties as 
soon as they are appointed. Each year, Directors receive 
the Company’s Code of Ethics (Responsible Business 
Principles).

The MDR-P-required information about the policies

reported in section 2.15. Policies of the Sustainability 
notes. 
G1-1_01
Telefónica works guided by the values of integrity, 
commitment and transparency, in its decision-making, 
daily performance, and the way it interacts with the 
environment.
Therefore, it promotes ethical behaviour and responsible 
business management through the establishment, 
development, promotion and evaluation of a corporate 
culture aligned with ESG factors that deliver long-term 
business value. In fact, it works to ensure that 
behaviours, processes, internal activities and targets are 
consistent with the Company’s purpose and values. To 
this end, the Telefónica Group has a code of ethics and 
conduct, the Responsible Business Principles (RBPs), 
which are structured around 10 areas:   
1. Ethical and responsible management.
2.Corporate governance and internal control.
3.Respect for and promotion of human and digital rights.
4.Commitment to the environment.
5.Innovation, development and responsible use of 
technology.
6.Responsible communication.
7. Commitment to customers.
8.Commitment to employees.
9.Commitment to the societies in which the Group 
operates.
10. Responsible supply chain management.
In addition, since 2002, Telefónica has been a signatory 
to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a 
voluntary framework allowing companies to align their 
operations and strategies with the 10 principles on 
human rights, labour, the environment and the fight 
against corruption. 
To prevent negative impacts related to corporate culture 
(G1_IN01) and incorporate sustainability criteria into the 
Group's management and culture, Telefónica 
continuously implements global and local actions aimed 
at all levels of the organisation: 
• Regulation: the Telefónica Group develops, updates 
and approves corporate policies on relevant matters 
related to the Responsible Business Principles. Details 
of these policies can be found in the following section 
of the Sustainability notes:
  2.15. Policies 
• Training and awareness-raising: Telefónica trains its 
professionals in the Responsible Business Principles 
and Human Rights, and complements this with other 
strategic training—whether online or in-person—that 
delves deeper into the principles mentioned above.
Additionally, the Company develops awareness-
raising and communication campaigns on key issues 
such as privacy, digital security, ethics and artificial 
intelligence (AI), environmental management, 
accessibility, diversity and the responsible use of 
technology.
• Internal processes and activities: through the 
Responsibility by Design project, the Telefónica Group 
incorporates ethical, social and environmental aspects 
into the development processes of products and 
services. In addition, it aligns with other corporate 
areas, such as Network or General Services, and 
provides guidance for organising events and 
sustainable productions, such as the Shareholders’ 
Meeting or the generation of content for Movistar 
Plus+.
• Alignment with business areas: the Company 
demonstrates the potential environmental benefits 
that its products and services bring to its customers' 
businesses through the Eco Smart Label. It also offers 
products and services with specific accessibility 
features for older people and those with disabilities, 
such as Movistar Plus+ 5S.
• Control processes: Telefónica promotes the 
robustness and efficiency of its internal control 
processes by encouraging the monitoring and proper 
management of sustainability indicators.
• Remuneration scheme: for short-term variable 
remuneration, 20% of the performance appraisal of 
employees includes sustainability indicators. In 
addition, 10% is included in long-term variable 
remuneration, which applies to senior management.
• Employee satisfaction survey: the survey includes 
questions that allow for the evaluation of the 
corporate culture.

2.14.3.2. Queries (Responsible Business) 
Channel and Whistleblowing Channel
G1-1_02
Queries (Responsible Business) Channel
The Telefónica Group provides a Queries Channel that is 
accessible 24/7 via its institutional and commercial 
websites and available in the languages of the Group’s 
main operators (Spanish, English, German and 
Portuguese), so that all its stakeholders (employees, 
partners and suppliers, affected communities, customers 
and/or end-users, among others) can directly contact 
the Company with queries related to any aspect of its 
code of ethics and conduct. To ensure its effectiveness, 
the Company has a Communication Channel that allows 
two-way communication with stakeholders throughout 
the query management process.
All communications received are handled internally in 
accordance with the principles of respect, 
confidentiality, trustworthiness and completeness, and 
are governed by the Queries Channel Management 
Regulation, which is published on the website. Personal 
data contained in the communications received, 
whether anonymous or identifiable, are processed in 
accordance with privacy and personal data protection 
legislation, the Telefónica Group’s Global Privacy Policy 
and the Personal Data Protection Governance Model 
Regulation. 
Whistleblowing Channel  
The Telefónica Group has an Internal Information 
System that incorporates the Whistleblowing Channel to 
detect, report and investigate issues related to unlawful 
acts or behaviour contrary to the Code of Conduct. In 
this regard, it is the main tool that Telefónica makes 
available to all its employees, managers and directors, as 
well as to third parties, allowing them to anonymously or 
personally communicate any information or situation 
that may involve a suspected irregularity or act contrary 
to the law or internal regulations.
G1-3_02, G1-3_03
The Board of Directors of Telefónica S.A. has entrusted 
the management of its Internal Information System to 
the Chief Compliance Officer, who performs their duties 
autonomously and independently, with the necessary 
personal and material resources for this purpose. The 
Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the Board 
of Directors and the Audit and Control Committee. 
G1-3_01
The general principles governing the Internal 
Information System are set out in Telefónica’s Internal 
Information System Management Policy (included in the 
Policies table). The Internal Information System 
Management Procedure (also included in the Policies 
Table) applies to the management of all communications 
received through Telefónica’s Internal Information 
System. 
The Whistleblowing Channel is always available (24/7) in 
multiple languages and via platforms such as the 
Telefónica website and intranet, the toll-free telephone 
numbers and specific email addresses. Communications 
can be made either verbally or in writing. The channel 
also makes it possible to check the status of a 
communication, add additional information and contact 
the team responsible for its analysis. The Compliance 
Survey measures employee knowledge of and trust in 
the different elements that make up the Compliance 
Program at Telefónica, including the Internal Information 
System
The protection of whistleblowers and the prohibition of 
retaliation is established in Section 6 of the Internal 
Information System Management Policy. It expressly 
states that Telefónica and the other companies of the 
Group, in accordance with the provisions of applicable 
law, shall not adopt and shall ensure that no form of 
retaliation, whether direct or indirect, including threats 
or attempts at retaliation, shall be adopted against 
directors, officers, employees or suppliers who have 
reported in good faith through the Information System 
any possible irregular conduct or non-compliance.
2.14.3.3. Training
G1-1_10
The Telefónica Group's business conduct training 
focuses on two pillars:
Training in Responsible Business Principles
The Company trains all staff annually, regardless of their 
position or role, in the Responsible Business Principles 
(RBPs) and Human Rights. The course is delivered 
online, is mandatory and covers topics such as: Ethical 
and responsible management; Respect and promotion 
of human rights and digital rights; Commitment to the 
environment; Innovation, development and responsible 
use of technology; Responsible communication; 
Commitment to customers, employees and the societies 
in which the Company operates; Responsible 
management of the supply chain; the Queries Channel 
and the Whistleblowing Channel.
New employees, in addition to being introduced to the 
principles in the welcome pack, are required to take the 
specific RBPs course within a maximum of three months 
of joining the Company. Both the course and the 
Responsible Business Principles are available in the 
official languages of the Telefónica Group: Spanish, 
English, German and Portuguese. 
Internal communication campaigns are also run to 
highlight the importance of completing the course on 
the Responsible Business Principles and Human Rights. 
A multidisciplinary team comprising the Compliance, 
People and ESG departments monitors its fulfilment.

In 2022, the new edition of the RBPs and Human Rights 
course was launched, with a validity period of three 
years. During this period, a total of 90,725 employees 
have been trained.
ESG training
Furthermore, with the aim of promoting a culture of 
sustainability among all professionals within the 
Telefónica Group, strategic training on key ESG matters 
was available year round in 2024, on environmental 
management, ethics and compliance, accessibility, 
diversity, cybersecurity, privacy, human rights, 
Responsibility by Design of products and services, 
sustainable finance, the responsible use of technology 
and supply chain management.
These training sessions are made available to employees 
through the ESG Academy, a sustainability training 
space. The content is developed in collaboration with 
various Company departments and includes both 
internal and external online courses, podcasts, webinars, 
videos, articles of interest and reference web pages on 
sustainability. The ESG Academy also offers live training 
through Universitas, Telefónica’s Corporate University.

G1-3, G1-4
2.14.4.1. Prevention and detection of 
corruption or bribery
G1.MDR-A_01-12, G1-3_01
The  Telefónica Group's commitment to fighting 
corruption and bribery and to regulatory compliance in 
general led the Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. to 
approve the creation of an independent regulatory 
compliance area on 16 December 2015 and, 
subsequently, the appointment of the Chief Compliance 
Officer of the Telefónica Group in February 2016; this 
officer reports directly to the Board of Directors through 
the Audit and Control Committee. As with their 
appointment, the power to dismiss the Chief 
Compliance Officer falls under the authority of 
Telefónica S.A.’s Board of Directors.
The goal pursued was to continue to implement a 
compliance model at Telefónica in a much more 
targeted way, with due regard for all the activities 
performed up until that point by other areas of the 
Company in order to prevent corruption and bribery (e.g. 
Internal Audit, the Global Sustainability Management 
(ESG) Department and Legal Area). 
Compliance Function
The purpose of the Compliance Function is to manage 
the preventive and reactive aspects of compliance with 
(a) domestic legislation and (b) Telefónica’s internal 
regulations, both at a corporate and operational level 
(countries and businesses), in general, while focusing 
specifically on those that are more sensitive depending 
on the circumstances. 
The Chief Compliance Officer reports regularly to the 
Board of Directors and the Audit and Control Committee 
on the key aspects of the Telefónica Group’s 
Compliance Program, which mainly focuses on integrity 
and the fight against corruption and bribery. 
In addition, at the first meeting of the Audit and Control 
Committee of the year, the Chief Compliance Officer 
presents the Compliance Function’s Annual Report for 
the previous year and the Compliance Area’s Action Plan 
for the new year. 
The Compliance Function Policy defines the main lines 
of the Telefónica Group’s Compliance Program, its 
relationship with the Company’s business processes and 
other areas, and the matters identified as particularly 
relevant.
While the Compliance Function extends to managing 
compliance frameworks across various areas3, safeguarding 
integrity is particularly sensitive and significant for the entire 
organisation.
The Compliance Function, in accordance with the current 
Compliance Function Policy, is deployed on two levels: 
preventive controls and reaction and response. 
Preventive controls 
To generate a culture of compliance, which operates 
through the following functions:  
• Regulatory compliance monitoring: responsible for 
coordinating the Group's regulatory framework. Plays 
a key role in establishing regulations and protocols 
aimed at preventing unlawful and unregulated 
conduct, with different levels depending on the 
sensitivity of the situation.
This function includes the coordination of both the 
ongoing publication of policies and regulations on a 
specific site on the corporate intranet and the 
dissemination and communication of new policies and 
regulations through internal tools after their approval. 
With regard to the policies and procedures 
implemented in the Telefónica Group to combat 
corruption and bribery, it is worth highlighting the 
specific internal regulations in this regard, the most 
significant of which is the Anti-Corruption Policy. The 
content of this policy is aligned with the provisions of

the United Nations Convention against Corruption of 
2004.
Among other aspects, the Anti-Corruption Policy sets 
out the guidelines on conduct which must be followed 
at Telefónica with regard to accepting or offering gifts 
or invitations and prohibiting any type of bribery. Rules 
on offering gifts or invitations to public employees and 
civil servants are specifically expanded upon in the 
Regulation on Relations with Public Bodies. 
The regulatory framework on integrity is 
complemented by the Conflict of Interest Regulation 
and the Corporate Policy on the Comprehensive 
Discipline Program, among others.
The Conflict of Interest Regulation requires members 
of the Company to act at all times, and especially in the 
event of a conflict of interest, in accordance with the 
corporate principles of loyalty, confidentiality and 
integrity. It also covers situations in which a direct or 
indirect personal interest of an employee influences, 
could influence or could give rise to the perception of 
being able to influence the professional decisions to be 
made by that employee, with the possibility that this 
interest or professional benefit may come into conflict 
with the interests of any Telefónica Group company.
G1-3_05
As the parties responsible for establishing adequate 
controls and procedures to comply with the Anti-
Corruption Policy, the Company's directors and 
executives certify their knowledge of and commitment 
to complying with the Responsible Business Principles 
and said policy on an annual basis, and with the 
associated policies, practices and regulations.
• Knowledge management: involves training and 
awareness-raising activities on issues such as anti-
corruption, criminal prevention and sanctions, as well 
as supporting other Company training.
G1-3_06
A key element in promoting a culture of ethics and 
integrity within the Company is anti-corruption 
training. This comprises the following global-level 
courses: 
◦The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) course on 
the law against corrupt practices abroad, included in 
the 2022 Training Framework.
G1-1_11
This is a mandatory global training activity that is 
conducted every three years and aimed at Company 
positions and areas with a higher potential risk due 
to their greater exposure to a risk of public 
corruption, which would include, alongside 
employees with executive status, those employees 
belonging to areas such as regulation, institutional 
relations, sponsorships, commercial, major 
customers, network, tax, marketing and/or 
commercial distribution, human resources, general 
secretariat, internal audit and internal control, 
among others. 
◦Responsible Business Principles and Human Rights 
course, included in the 2022 Training Framework.
This is a mandatory global training course that is 
aimed at all Telefónica Group employees and 
includes content on anti-corruption and bribery in 
the section corresponding to the first principle 
“Ethical and responsible management”.
  2.14.3.3. Training
◦Code of Ethics and Conduct course: integrity and 
combating corruption, included in the 2024 Training 
Framework and aimed at Telefónica Group 
employees in Spain, Brazil, Hispanoamerica, Telxius, 
Telefónica Tech and the Global Units.
This course includes an initial module that reviews 
the Telefónica Group's Code of Ethics and 
Responsible Business Principles, and a second 
module focused on anti-corruption regulations, with 
particular emphasis on the Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act.
G1-3_07
These training activities ensure that 100% of 
positions operating in risk areas are covered by 
corruption and bribery prevention training programs. 
At a local level in most countries where the 
Telefónica Group operates, other specific training 
sessions on anti-corruption and criminal prevention 
are provided. In some cases, they are taught on an 
in-person basis and targeted at certain groups of 
employees whose activity may present a higher 
potential risk. It is worth mentioning the training 
delivered in Spain, Peru, Argentina, Chile and 
Ecuador on the criminal liability of the legal entity.  
In addition, new Telefónica Group employees 
receive training on the Compliance Program, which 
includes content on anti-corruption policies and 
regulations, as part of their induction into the Group.
G1-3_08 
There are also specific anti-corruption training 
programs tailored to the members of the 
administrative, management and supervisory bodies.
Another of the crucial elements of the Compliance 
Program is awareness-raising. In addition to the 
publication of news and updates on the Group's 
internal channels, there are a number of initiatives, 
both global and local, aimed at fostering a culture of 
compliance among employees. Of the initiatives 
carried out in 2024, the following are particularly 
noteworthy: 
◦Compliance Day, a global internal awareness day 
designed to familiarise the business with the

Compliance Function and raise employee 
awareness of current issues dealt with by the 
Compliance Program. As part of this activity, the 
Company runs a compliance quiz, with 10 questions 
related to compliance issues. 
◦The Five Stars Recognition Program, designed to 
promote and acknowledge outstanding behaviour 
that demonstrates a commitment to integrity, 
sanctions, privacy and security, both locally and 
globally. The VI edition was held in 2024. 
◦Compliance Cafés, informal meetings designed to 
enable different areas of the Group to gain a better 
understanding of the role performed by Compliance, 
raising awareness of the importance of acting 
appropriately in certain situations that may arise on a 
day-to-day basis. They serve to remind employees 
of the tools that Telefónica makes available to its 
employees to combat corruption and bribery.
◦Information for third parties on integrity. Since 2023, 
in order to share the key regulations regarding 
integrity and the consequences of non-compliance 
among those in the Telefónica Group value chain, an 
email containing this information has been sent 
every six months to all suppliers awarded contracts.
◦Launch of the III Compliance Survey. The aim was to 
gauge internal knowledge of and trust regarding the 
various elements that comprise the Compliance 
Program at Telefónica, including the Internal 
Information System, and also to glean perceptions of 
the Group’s ethics and compliance culture.
• Risk assessment: As part of its system for preventing 
and detecting corruption and bribery, Telefónica 
conducts a basic compliance risk assessment every six 
months. This forms part of the risk management model 
based on the guidelines of the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) and is implemented uniformly 
across the Group's main operations. It includes 
everything related to corruption and bribery 
prevention practices. 
• Consultative: This prevention and detection system 
is complemented by the consultation activities carried 
out through channels that allow employees to make 
queries related to compliance issues (regarding the 
application of the Anti-Corruption Policy and other 
internal regulations developed in the area of integrity 
and the fight against corruption and bribery).
• Third parties: Another line of action is geared 
towards the coordination of all initiatives related to the 
involvement of third parties in enforcing the 
regulations. In this regard, Telefónica believes it is of 
the utmost importance that the third parties with 
whom it interacts in the course of certain relationships 
comply with the corresponding standards of business 
ethics. 
Therefore, in addition to the implementation of certain 
measures such as responsible declarations and 
contractual safeguards, the Group has developed 
protocols for assessing suppliers and business partners 
from a compliance point of view. Integrity risks, mainly 
corruption and bribery, are assessed and are 
implemented as part of an ethos of continuous 
improvement. In this context, Telefónica’s 
procurement and payment controls are particularly 
important, which is why Compliance is involved in 
them.
Reaction and response
• Reaction refers to existing action protocols for 
situations where there are signs of non-compliance. 
Telefónica has an Internal Information System 
designed to comply with Law 2/2023 and to promote 
compliance with the Responsible Business Principles, 
the law and other internal regulations. The system has 
appropriate mechanisms in place to ensure the 
confidentiality of communications and to channel 
possible complaints. 
 2.14.3.2. Queries (Responsible Business) Channel and 
Whistleblowing Channel
G1-1_08
Moreover, in addition to the procedure for following up 
on whistleblower complaints in accordance with the 
applicable legislation transposing Directive (EU) 
2019/1937, Telefónica regulates the procedure and 
guarantees for investigating cases related to business 
conduct through its Compliance Function Charter, 
including cases of corruption and bribery, promptly, 
independently and objectively.  
• Response encompasses remedial action to deal with 
the ramifications of non-compliance by mitigating the 
repercussions of any type associated with a possible 
breach or a breach already evidenced and ensuring 
consistent application of sanctions for said breaches, 
as well as promoting the recognition of employees 
who display outstanding behaviour in terms of their 
commitment to compliance. 
Indeed, the following Telefónica Group companies have 
anti-corruption and bribery certifications:
• ISO 37001:2016 certification on Anti-Bribery 
Management Systems: Colombia Telecomunicaciones 
S.A. ESP BIC, Telefónica del Perú S.A., Telefónica de

Telefónica, S.A. and the United States Department of 
Justice (DOJ) entered into a Deferred Prosecution 
Agreement (DPA) to resolve a single charge of 
conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the 
FCPA. The charge, made against Telefónica Venezolana, 
C.A., concerns conduct in and around 2014 and 2015 
related to a Venezuelan Government-sponsored 
currency auction.
Telefónica, S.A. is not a defendant in the matter but as 
parent company of the Telefónica Group has agreed to 
certain terms and conditions under the DPA. 
 G1-4_02, SBM-3_08
The terms of the DPA include, inter alia, requirements 
concerning a corporate compliance program, annual 
reports on that program during the term of the DPA and 
a monetary penalty of $85,260,000 U.S. dollars 
(approximately 81 million euros, see Note 29.b of the 
2024 Consolidated Financial Statements). The DOJ has 
agreed that if all the obligations under the DPA are fully 
complied with, then the DOJ will seek dismissal with 
prejudice of the charge described above after the DPA 
concludes.
G1-5
2.14.4.2. Political influence and lobbying 
activities
In relation to the main issues addressed by lobbying 
activities, Telefónica supports five positions:
G1-5_09
1. Create market structures favourable to investment.
Telefónica supports consolidation within national 
markets as the first and main step to achieving 
sufficient scale to attract the necessary level of 
investment. Telefónica sees scaling in the market as 
the main tool for offering significant consumer welfare 
benefits, as it would encourage the growth of 
sustainable network actors capable of investing in the 
most advanced, secure and resilient networks. 
2.Reduce obsolete and overly intrusive regulation.
Telefónica’s main stance is that regulation of the 
telecommunications market is obsolete and overly 
intrusive. Telefónica is in favour of a review of the 
current ex ante regulatory model to minimise this type 
of regulation, and base intervention on ex post action.
3.Balance the digital ecosystem.
Telefónica supports a digital ecosystem based on 
commercial agreements reached through business 
negotiations. Given the dysfunction in the Internet 
value chain due to significant imbalances in bargaining 
power, Telefónica advocates restoring balance in said 
power through a conflict resolution mechanism 
between telecommunications operators and content 
and application providers when commercial 
negotiations fail. 
It also supports the establishment of a common 
framework for all actors in the digital ecosystem that 
defines a minimum set of obligations to ensure fair 
relationships among all actors, especially between 
telecommunications operators and cloud 
infrastructure providers.
4.Make spectrum policy a lever for investment and 
growth.
Telefónica argues that spectrum allocation and 
assignment are key levers for promoting investment 
and growth in all countries. Telefónica backs the 
reform of the political framework for the spectrum to 
mitigate future shortages in the low and medium 
bands and to ensure future awards do not lead to 
inefficient outcomes or disproportionate prices and 
conditions.
5.Incorporate digital networks into the EU’s Taxonomy 
for sustainable activities.
Telefónica mainly challenges the unjustified lack of 
recognition of telecommunications networks and 
services as a Taxonomy-aligned activity.
In this regard, Telefónica calls for better recognition of 
telecommunications networks in the Taxonomy, 
including telecommunications networks as a 
Taxonomy-eligible economic activity for the next 
revision of the Climate Delegated Act.
G1-5_10
To provide transparency and prevent these activities 
from being seen in a negative light, Telefónica S.A. is 
registered in the EU Transparency Register (registration 
number: 52431421-12).
Germany has had the Lobby Register Act since 2021; this 
requires companies and their lobbyists who are in 
contact with politicians to publish certain information in 
relation to their activities. In March of this year, the 
Bundestag amended the law to broaden the scope of 
registration obligations. Telefónica Germany has an 
entry in the register and the Company transparently 
updates relevant lobbying activities as required 
(registration number: R002277).
There is no national Lobby Register in Spain. There are 
registers at regional level and in specific institutions 
(regulatory authorities). Telefónica is registered as 
follows: 
• C.N.M.C.: Telefónica S.A. (CNMC RGI).
• Madrid City Council: Telefónica Spain.
• Madrid Regional Government: Telefónica Spain.

Appointments to the administrative, 
management and supervisory bodies
G1-5_11
Telefónica has a revolving door policy included in the 
Internal Regulation on Relations with Public Entities. This 
regulation does not allow individuals who have held 
administrative roles directly related to the Company’s 
activities to be hired as employees or members of 
governing bodies for a period of two years following the 
exercise of the aforesaid direct functions. The direct 
relation is understood to refer to those cases in which 
the affected person or the governing body in question 
has issued resolutions or adopted any agreement in 
relation to the Company.
Based on these provisions, from an employment 
perspective, a control system has been implemented 
across Telefónica. 
The Company has not employed anyone who is actively 
working for governments or regulators in the past two 
years.
G1-5_01, G1-5_02, G1-5_03, G1-5_06
Telefónica has Responsible Business Principles, 
approved by the Board of Directors, that establish the 
Company’s positions in various areas, including political 
neutrality.
In this regard, Telefónica is politically neutral. It remains 
strictly impartial and does not support or oppose any 
political party. It makes no donations to political parties 
or to public or private organisations linked to political 
parties. 
This does not prevent it, in compliance with prevailing 
legislation, from making its views known on matters that 
may affect the management and sustainability of the 
Company, through lobbying activities. 
In this regard, Telefónica transparently reports its 
lobbying or engagement activities, where applicable, 
through the various registers created for this purpose. 
These registers are free of charge.
The Sustainability and Regulation Committee has been 
entrusted with the following responsibilities, among 
others:
• Bring to the attention of the Board of Directors matters 
deemed relevant to the Company or any of the Group 
companies and on which it is necessary or advisable to 
adopt a decision or establish a specific strategy, 
including, in particular, issues related to the relevant 
supervisory and regulatory bodies in the 
telecommunications sector.
• Supervise and review the Company’s Responsible 
Business Policy strategies and practices, including 
environmental and social matters, ensuring they align 
with stakeholder expectations and contribute to value 
creation, proposing their update or modification to the 
Board of Directors, where applicable. 
• Promote a proactive relationship strategy with 
stakeholders: customers, investors, suppliers, 
employees and society in general, with the purpose of 
defining the material issues affecting the Company 
from risk and opportunity perspectives.
G1-2
2.14.5. Suppliers
2.14.5.1. Responsible management
G1-2_02 
Telefónica acknowledges that a substantial part of a 
company’s social and environmental impact stems 
directly from its supply chain. 
The Company recognises sustainability as a core pillar of 
its relationship with its suppliers, integrating responsible 
practices into its supply chain.
Similarly, collaborating with suppliers gains strategic 
value, as it facilitates alignment with Company 
commitments towards customers and the rest of 
society.
To build trusting relationships with its suppliers, 
Telefónica has developed robust policies and processes 
with a threefold purpose: 
• Firstly, to manage the potential impacts.  
The actions of the Company and those of its suppliers 
may have adverse impacts on human rights and the 
environment (G1_IN08). The most relevant of these 
relate to the labour conditions of workers in the supply 
chain and the suppliers’ carbon emissions. 
Companies can also generate positive impacts 
through responsible management of the supply chain. 
For example, through implementing social criteria that 
seek to improve the quality of life of the workers in the 
supply chain.
• Secondly, to identify risks throughout the supply chain 
in order to address them effectively. Among these risks 
are the potential regulatory breaches that could lead 
to sanctions or reputational damage for the Group due 
to supplier-related sustainability controversies. In this 
regard, Telefónica considers it of the utmost 
importance that the suppliers with which it interacts 
comply with the corresponding standards of business 
ethics. Every six months, the awarded suppliers 
receive a communication containing the Group's main 
regulations on integrity and the consequences of 
failing to comply with these.

• Thirdly, to engage proactively on key issues to seize 
the opportunities associated with the supply chain. 
This engagement with suppliers is based on ethical 
and fair business relationships; these engender 
opportunities through the ability to create operational 
efficiencies, which are reflected, for example, in 
reductions in material, energy and transport costs. 
Labour productivity can also be improved by ensuring 
decent working conditions in the supply chain.
The details of the IROs related to workers in the 
supply chain can be found in the chapter 2.12. ESRS 
S2. 
With this threefold approach, the Company aims to 
provide customers with products and services that not 
only benefit society and the environment but are also 
developed with ethical and sustainability principles in 
mind.
The sustainable management of the supply chain is part 
of the Responsible Business Plan. The Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee oversees its implementation and 
monitors compliance with targets.
To this end, the Company relies on a Procurement 
Model (MCT) that is aligned with its Responsible 
Business Principles and with international standards 
such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for 
Responsible Business Conduct. Telefónica's 
Procurement Model is governed by a corporate 
regulation that establishes the general conditions and 
criteria for the acquisition of goods and services, as well 
as its scope of application and exclusions.
Through the agreements negotiated under Telefónica´s 
Procurement Model, the Company awarded a contract 
volume of 24,202 million euros to 8,440 suppliers. Both 
figures refer respectively to total MCT purchases and 
suppliers awarded, with impact on the financial year 
2024.  
Of the awarded volume, 85% went to local suppliers, 
understood as those with a registered office in the 
country where the purchase was made.
Supply chain management
Step 1. Minimum standards required 
G1-2_03
Telefónica requires its suppliers to sign an anti-
corruption certificate stating their commitment to 
compliance with anti-corruption laws. This requirement 
currently applies to 100% of the suppliers managed 
under the Procurement Model and a large part of the 
rest of the Group's suppliers and business partners. 
Furthermore, under the Procurement Model, Telefónica 
requires its suppliers to ensure compliance with 
fundamental human and labour rights as well as 
environmental protections. Therefore, Telefónica’s 
suppliers must accept the Supply Chain Sustainability 
Policy when registering and/or renewing their accounts 
in the procurement system. This policy sets out the 
minimum responsible business criteria that they must 
comply with (thereby directly affecting the employees in 
the supply chain).
Prior acceptance of these minimum conditions means 
that awarded suppliers take on specific commitments 
regarding social and environmental impacts as outlined 
in Telefónica’s regulations. 
The minimum responsible business criteria that suppliers 
must comply with are set out in the section 2.15. Policies.
Step 2. Identification of suppliers with a potential 
sustainability high risk
The Company carries out a more targeted approach to 
managing key suppliers within the Procurement Model 
due to their potential level of risk in terms of 
sustainability, mainly taking into account factors such as 
product or service type supplied, supplier country of 
origin and the impact on Telefónica.
To achieve this, in accordance with Telefónica’s risk 
analysis methodology, the Group analyses the potential 
global sustainability risk of its suppliers.
According to this global risk analysis, the Company had 
661 suppliers that provide products or services classified 
as potentially high risk from a sustainability perspective 
in 2024. A supplier is considered as such if, according to 
Telefónica's internal supplier risk analysis methodology, 
it obtains a potential high risk level after the 
aforementioned factors have been analysed and it had 
been awarded a total volume of more than one million 
euros during 2024.  
Step 3. Performance assessment of potential high-
risk suppliers
To identify potential integrity risks (corruption and 
bribery)/international sanctions, Telefónica cross-
references its supplier database against the Dow Jones 
Risk & Compliance Watchlist database. This reinforces 
existing processes to ensure compliance with its Anti-
Corruption Policy and Sanctions Regulation. This cross-
referencing is performed periodically from the moment 
the supplier is registered in Telefónica's system. 
If a supplier is flagged on the Watchlist database due to 
integrity concerns, an analysis is performed to assess 
such information and its relevance for the purposes of 
the specific contract.
In addition, Telefónica monitors possible risks associated 
with its potential high-risk sustainability suppliers, as 
identified in the initial analysis. The external assessment 
platform IntegrityNext conducts a 360º assessment of 
these suppliers based on 15 sustainability criteria

encompassing ethical, social, environmental and supply 
chain management aspects.
These assessments allow the Company to identify any 
aspects that could be better managed by its suppliers 
and proactively work to avoid or minimise potential 
adverse impacts on human rights or the environment. 
Of the initially identified potential high-risk suppliers, 407 
had been externally assessed on sustainability aspects 
through the IntegrityNext platform by the end of 2024 
(including those whose assessment is currently being 
finalised, pending IntegrityNext's analysis of the 
information provided). The procurement teams in the 
various countries can view the results directly on the 
procurement platform.
In extreme cases, if a supplier fails to demonstrate a 
commitment to addressing an identified risk 
(IntegrityNext), or if the analysis against the Dow Jones 
Risk & Compliance Watchlist raises concerns, any 
further or existing business with that supplier is blocked 
until it demonstrates, where applicable, that it has 
corrected the situation and/or has implemented the 
necessary corrective measures to mitigate the identified 
risks as stipulated in the terms agreed by both parties. 
According to the data available in the Company’s 
systems at the end of period covered by this Report, 16 
suppliers were blocked due to integrity/international 
sanctions or sustainability risks or non-compliance.
Step 4. Key supplier audits
The performance assessments are complemented by 
Telefónica’s annual audit plan to verify compliance with 
the critical aspects identified according to type of 
supplier, service and product provided, and the risks of 
each region or country. This plan covers audits of both 
direct suppliers, with whom the Company has a direct 
commercial relationship, as well as indirect suppliers.
These audits are mainly performed through the internal 
Allies Program (for service providers) and the sectoral 
Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) initiative (for product 
manufacturers). Both types are performed by in-house 
employees or accredited auditing entities and apply the 
corresponding established protocols.
In 2024, the Company conducted 20,898 administrative 
or on-site audits. This number includes both 
administrative audits involving documentary verification
—for example via email or an online platform—and on-
site audits carried out at the supplier's premises. These 
audits verify the suppliers' level of compliance with 
labour, occupational health and safety, environmental, 
human rights, conflict minerals, security and data 
protection and/or their own supply chain management.
The audits include improvement plans agreed with all 
suppliers who do not comply with any of the aspects 
that may have a negative social or environmental 
impact. Through agreed improvement plans, suppliers 
make a commitment to remedying adverse impacts that 
they have caused or contributed to. 
Some examples of non-conformities identified in the 
audits, as well as the respective action and improvement 
plans, are included in the on-site audits action plan in 
the section:
 2.12. ESRS S2 - Workers in the value chain
Supplier engagement 
Telefónica’s sustainable management model is 
complemented, in each of the four steps, by 
engagement with suppliers. To support this, it 
implements:
• Ongoing communication through various channels 
such as the Allies newsletter or the Supplier Portal.  
Through this portal, suppliers and their employees can 
access Telefónica’s global policies and a confidential 
channel for queries and concerns relating to 
compliance with the Company's minimum responsible 
business criteria.
• Sector-specific initiatives focused on developing 
solutions at a sectoral level (for example, through 
working groups on climate change, human rights due 
diligence and the circular economy).
• In-person or online training for suppliers, addressing 
the specific needs in each country and the most 
critical issues according to the service they provide. 
Needs include those focused on the decarbonisation 
of the supply chain. Details of these are included in the 
engagement initiatives described in the chapter:
 2.9. ESRS E1 - Climate change
• Topic-specific meetings and workshops to share best 
practices.
2.14.6. Network and data security
2.14.6.1. Governance
The global Security and Intelligence Area is supported by 
the Company’s management, and reports to the Board of 
Directors through the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee and the Audit and Control Committee. 
The highest security officer in the Company is the Global 
Chief Security Officer (Global CSO). The Board of Directors 
has delegated the Global CSO the authority and 
responsibility to establish the global security strategy. the 
Global CSO leads the development and monitors the 
implementation of Telefónica regulatory framework and 
global security initiatives. The Global CSO also proposes a 
local security officer for each company within the 
Telefónica Group, subject to the decision of the 
corresponding administrative or management bodies of the 
Group.

In terms of governance and coordination, a bi-monthly 
security meeting is held, which is chaired by the Global 
CSO. The meeting is attended by the local security officers 
(local CSOs), and corporate officers from different areas of 
the Company (Compliance, Audit, Legal, Technology and 
Operations, People, Sustainability, among others.) are 
invited on a discretionary basis.
There are also local security sub-committees chaired by the 
local CSOs, which take part in defining strategic initiatives 
and global guidelines and implement them in each 
Telefónica Group company. 
In addition, the Global Security and Intelligence Area 
promotes and drives the Global Digital Security Committee, 
in which several members of the Company’s Executive 
Committee participate, and the Business Continuity Global 
Working Group.
Telefónica also has a Security Advisory Council composed 
of external experts in the field of security and intelligence. 
This council has the aim of improving practices, increasing 
the efficiency of capabilities and procedures, and 
enhancing the quality of strategy in this area.
2.14.6.2. Strategy
Telefónica understands security to be a comprehensive 
concept aimed at preserving assets, interests and 
strategic objectives, ensuring their integrity and 
protecting them from potential threats that could harm 
their value, affect their confidentiality, diminish their 
effectiveness or impact their operability and availability.
Comprehensive security encompasses:
• Physical and operational security (of people and 
assets).
• Digital security.
• Business continuity.
• Fraud prevention.
• Security in the supply chain.
• Any other relevant area or function aimed at corporate 
protection against potential damage or loss. 
Digital security, in turn, encompasses information 
security and cybersecurity, and is applied to the 
platforms, systems, technologies and elements that 
comprise the network.
To meet the security information needs of stakeholders 
in a clear, concise and accessible manner, there is a 
'Security' section in the Global Transparency Centre 
available on Telefónica's public website. This section 
also facilitates the communication of vulnerabilities or 
threats that could affect Telefónica's technological 
infrastructure.
2.14.6.3. Policies
The MDR-P-required information about the Global 
Security Policy is gathered and reported in the following 
section of the Sustainability notes:
 2.15. Policies
2.14.6.4. Action Plans
The Global Strategic Plan for Security and Intelligence is 
designed in accordance with relevant security 
information from the companies within the Telefónica 
Group. It identifies and prioritises the main global lines of 
action over a three-year time horizon. The plan is 
reviewed annually and approved at the bi-monthly 
security meeting of the Telefónica Group.
The purpose of the Strategic Plan is to evolve the 
Company's comprehensive security, adapting it to the 
most effective and efficient solutions available in order 
to apply economies of scale, thereby contributing to 
promoting maximum security for employees, customers 
and suppliers.
2.14.6.5. Metrics and targets
Telefónica has defined the following metric:
Number of material cybersecurity incidents 
A cyber incident is considered material if there is a 
substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would 
deem it relevant when making an investment or voting 
decision, or if it significantly alters the information 
already made available to investors.
To monitor the effectiveness of measures aimed at 
network and data security, and to achieve a level of 
security appropriate to business needs that ensures the 
protection of assets as established by the Global 
Security Policy, Telefónica has set the target of having 
the lowest possible number of material incidents.
Performance in 2024: 0.
Material cyber incidents taken into account for the year 
corresponding to the reporting period are those 
occurring in the entities in which Telefónica has 
effective control. These material cyber incidents are 
reported to the regulatory authorities of the stock 
markets on which Telefónica, S.A. is listed.

The Board of Directors 
of Telefónica, S.A.
Following the entry into force of the 
reform of the Criminal Code (CC) 
introduced by Organic Law 5/2010 of 
22 June, the Telefónica Group 
undertook a process, focusing 
primarily on Spain, of reviewing and 
updating its control systems to ensure 
their compliance with the new legal 
requirements, particularly in view of 
the provisions of Article 31 bis of the 
CC, intensifying its preventive 
measures to inhibit the commission of 
potentially criminal acts. 
Subsequently, successive reforms of 
the CC have given rise to a process of 
continuous review of the control 
environment. Specifically, following 
the approval of Organic Law 1/2015 of 
30 March and in particular of the new 
Articles 31 ter and 31 quáter, the 
control environment was revised and 
subsequently both the Spanish Public 
Prosecutor’s Office and case law have 
elaborated on certain issues relating 
to this matter. Similarly, the control 
environment was also reviewed in the 
wake of the amendments made to the 
CC through the approval of Organic 
Law 1/2019 of 21 February.

The relationship between climate and biodiversity is key 
for maintaining climate stability and for protecting soil, 
air and water. In addition to the Telefónica Group’s 
global target of net zero emissions, the Company must 
also focus on the health of ecosystems.  
The double materiality methodology outlined in chapter 
2.3. Materiality was followed to determine the materiality 
of Telefónica’s impacts, risks and opportunities. The 
topics, subtopics and sub-subtopics (sustainability 
issues) proposed by ESRS 1 were analysed, including 
those related to pollution, water and marine resources, 
biodiversity and ecosystems.

 2.2.4. Stakeholder management and relations 
E2.IRO-1_03
The results of the corporate-level assessment of nature-
related impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities, 
described in detail throughout this chapter, serve as a 
starting point for the double materiality analysis. After 
identifying, evaluating and applying the materiality 
threshold, environmental pollution (air, water and soil), 
water and marine resources (consumption and 
discharges), and biodiversity and ecosystems, were 
deemed non-material topics for the Group. For further 
information on the outcome of the double materiality 
assessment, see:
 2.3. Materiality
Nature-related impacts and dependencies
E2.IRO-1_01, E3.IRO-1_01, E4.IRO-1_01
To identify and assess the impacts, dependencies, risks 
and opportunities relating to pollution, water and 
biodiversity, Telefónica’s relationship with nature had to 
be thoroughly analysed. That is why Telefónica is 
working to align with the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a global initiative that 
provides a framework for factoring nature into business 
decisions. 
The scope of the assessment includes the Telefónica 
Group’s direct operations and those of the value chain, 
both upstream and downstream. This provides insight 
into the Group’s impacts and dependencies on the 
various ecosystems, species and ecosystem services.
Regarding the impacts, the Science-Based Targets for 
Nature (SBTN) Sectoral Materiality Tool was used to 
analyse the extent to which the Company’s various 
economic activities contribute to the main drivers of 
global biodiversity loss (climate change, ecosystem use 
changes, pollution, invasive species and the exploitation 
of resources such as water), as defined by the 
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
According to the results, the overall impact is greater 
across the value chain than for Telefónica's direct 
operations. 
In terms of Telefónica’s main direct operations (wired 
telecommunication, wireless telecommunication and 
other telecommunications economic activities), the 
pressures of climate change and land use change are 
the most significant. This is due to the use of energy to 
operate telecommunications networks and the need to 
occupy spaces for network deployment (construction of 
base stations and cable laying).

Likewise, the dependencies of the Telefónica Group’s 
economic activities on the ecosystem services provided 
by nature were analysed, both for direct operations and 
for those in the value chain.
This analysis, carried out using the ENCORE tool from 
the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC), 
concluded that economic activities related to wired, 
wireless and other telecommunication activities are the 
most nature-dependent. 
In these cases, the Group depends primarily on 
regulating ecosystem services, or in other words, those 
that offer protection from disruption to the production 
process, such as flood and storm protection, erosion 
control and climate regulation. 
The table below shows how Telefónica’s direct 
operations depend on ecosystem services. Only major 
dependencies (classified in ENCORE as medium, high or 
very high) are listed for the Company’s main economic 
activities.

Based on the impacts and dependencies assessment, 
Telefónica has developed a heat map that highlights the 
importance of each economic activity for the Company, 
taking into account its proportion of total turnover. In 
2024, with the support of the WWF Biodiversity Risk 
Filter and WWF Water Risk Filter tools, an initial 
assessment of nature-related risks and opportunities 
was conducted for the Telefónica Group’s most 
significant economic activities. 
Some results were refined based on a specific 
assessment conducted in 2019, which provided an 
insight into the impact of the Group’s facilities on the 
quality of habitats and ecosystem services. 
The exercise of identifying potential threats to 
Telefónica from its nature-related dependencies and 
impacts took into consideration the physical risks, 
transition risks and systemic risks.

2 The table shows the medium, high or very high dependencies on ecosystem services by the Telefónica Group’s main economic activities, which account for 
93% of the Company’s turnover.

Similarly, the exercise of identifying nature-related 
opportunities took into consideration those connected 
with business performance and sustainability 
performance.
One example of the risks identified and used in the 
double materiality process is the regulatory transition 
risk of sanctions for non-compliance with environmental 
legislation, especially if the facility is located in a 
protected area. 
As regards nature-related physical risks, these include 
the disruption of facility operations due to damage 
caused by extreme events that are not properly 
mitigated by ecosystem services, the costs of repairing 
damaged assets and the interruption of services and 
increased costs due to a reduced availability of water 
resources, especially in areas with high water stress.
Locating the Group's interface with nature
E4.IRO-1_14
To conduct direct operations and deliver connectivity to 
its customers, Telefónica needs fixed and mobile 
telecommunications networks, composed of tangible 
assets, including over 130,000 non-linear facilities, such 
as fixed and mobile switch sites, data centres, offices, 
base stations, radio links, landing stations, points of 
presence (POPs), television studios and shops, among 
facilities, in 12 countries. 
The Company has analysed the direct impacts of this 
infrastructure in the countries in which it operates, with 
results obtained at both the facility level and within its 
area of influence. To this end, a Geographic Information 
System (GIS) was used to overlay the infrastructure-
occupied area with various layers of information on 
protected areas and species, providing insights into the 
impacts on habitat quality and ecosystem services. The 
main conclusion of the study was that 98% of Telefónica 
Group’s facilities are located in habitats of low or very 
low biodiversity value, such as urban areas. Telefónica 
does not have facilities located in habitats of very high 
value. This suggests that the Company’s direct impact 
on biodiversity is not very significant. 
To define the environmental value of habitats, a 
methodology consistent with the approach proposed by 
the Biological Diversity Protocol of the Natural Capital 
Coalition and by DEFRA’s Biodiversity Metric was used. 
This methodology considered the protection of natural 
areas, but also other criteria such as land use, vegetation 
cover and the presence of threatened species.
Some of the Group’s facilities are inevitably located in or 
near protected areas or biodiversity-sensitive areas.
E4.IRO-1_15
Although direct operations do not contribute 
significantly to the drivers of biodiversity loss, they can 
have an impact on it. As stated previously, the main 
pressures are climate change and land-use change.
In relation to land-use change, most of Telefónica's 
facilities that were analysed are located in urban and 
industrial areas where there is no habitat loss or 
fragmentation. The majority of the surface area affected 
by these facilities is located in habitats with low or very 
low biodiversity value. Regarding the facilities located in 
biodiversity-sensitive areas, the effect of habitat 
fragmentation (reduction in habitat quality due to 
obstacles for animal species) is very limited. This is due 
to the non-linear nature of the sites and their relatively 
small size compared to the entirety of the habitat, which 
makes the edge effects negligible and reduces the 
spread of disturbances into the surrounding habitat.
There may be other low-severity impacts on wildlife 
arising from disturbances caused by the noise of 
telecommunications equipment, air conditioning or 
maintenance vehicle traffic. Furthermore, the 
construction of access roads necessary for network 
deployment may increase the habitat’s exposure to 
invasive species. Nevertheless, the severity of the impact 
is very low due to the perimeter/surface ratio of the 
Group’s facilities.
Mitigation hierarchy
E4.IRO-1_16
To manage impacts on biodiversity, the mitigation 
hierarchy is followed throughout the network’s life cycle, 
which makes it possible to identify expected impacts, act 
to prevent them, minimise them and implement 
restoration measures to offset residual impacts or losses.
As a prior step to the deployment of certain facilities, 
Telefónica identifies the potential environmental impacts 
of the deployment, operation and dismantling of its 
telecommunications networks through mandatory 
environmental impact assessment processes. Mitigation 
measures are also defined in this same process.
The model chosen to control the impact of Telefónica’s 
activities on the environment is the implementation of an 
Environmental Management System (EMS) in 
accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. All Group 
operators have an externally certified EMS. Operating 
under a certified EMS aims to help improve the 
environmental performance and operational control of 
the Company’s activities, as well as ensure compliance 
with applicable environmental legislation in the different 
countries. This is how, the environmental aspects 
associated with Telefónica's activity, such as 
biodiversity, water, energy and waste, are managed.
The majority of the Telefónica Group sites located in 
areas with high biodiversity value are small in size. 
However, in line with its EMS, preventive actions are 
implemented at all of them to avoid impacts. Some 
examples include locating facilities in spaces shared 
with other operators in order to minimise land use, avoid 
the need for vegetation removal and reduce visual 
impact.

In this regard, Telefónica Brazil prioritises locations 
outside protected natural areas for its base station 
installation projects. It also has working instructions that 
set out guidelines for optimal environmental monitoring, 
aiming to mitigate the impact of construction activities in 
the initial stage. 
To minimise unavoidable impacts on ecosystems, the 
Company implements best practices such as 
soundproofing measures, when necessary. Spill 
containment measures are also implemented to mitigate 
soil and water pollution in the event of potential 
accidents, as well as to mitigate possible effects on the 
surrounding vegetation and wildlife.
Telefónica pays special attention to areas with high 
biodiversity value. It also works to implement eco-
efficiency measures, carry out preventive maintenance 
of infrastructure, promote renewable energy use, adopt 
water-saving measures (particularly in areas of high 
water stress), replace equipment with low-consumption 
alternatives and encourage internal reuse. All of this 
enables the Group to optimise the consumption of 
water, materials and energy.
Whenever necessary, corrective measures are 
implemented to restore areas damaged by exposure to 
impacts that could not be fully avoided or reduced.
In Colombia, ecological and geomorphological 
restoration plans were carried out in several areas in 
2024 as a consequence of the dismantling of 
telecommunications stations located in protected areas, 
such as the Galeras Flora Sanctuary and Sumapaz. 
These activities, which followed the guidelines 
established by the state agency Parques Nacionales 
Naturales de Colombia, included recovering the 
geomorphology and vegetation cover after the 
telecommunications structure was dismantled. In 
addition, species native to the Superparamo ecosystem 
were used to revegetate the areas. All restoration 
projects are followed up and monitored in order to 
reinforce permanence over time.
Furthermore, under Telefónica’s offsetting strategy, 
residual carbon emissions will be absorbed from the 
atmosphere preferably through nature-based solutions, 
such as afforestation, reforestation and sustainable 
forest management.
These regenerative actions seek to generate a double 
benefit for the ecosystems. The aim is to go beyond 
carbon to enhance biodiversity and water quality and 
reduce deforestation and the risk of natural disasters.

Direct answer: Regarding money laundering, 
the Company has controls in place regarding 
payments, such as due diligence procedures 
on suppliers and business partners defined 
from a compliance standpoint, or controls on 
payments to certain countries classified as 
high risk. This in turn is complemented by 
activities specifically aimed at compliance with 
the requirements established in the legislation 
of each country, and/or certain regulations on 
this matter applicable by the type of company 
or entity in question (when it is considered, by 
local legislation, an obligated subject in this 
matter) and/or by type of activity. In this 
regard, in accordance with the internal 
regulation on payment control of the 
Telefónica Group, the Company monitors the 
definition of minimum controls on payments to 
prevent the risk of money laundering and 
terrorist financing, both at Group level and by 
jurisdiction and/or type of entity or activity.

1 The 2023 figure has been restated. Includes the accrual of government grants recorded by decreasing the book value of the related property, plant and 
equipment (see Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements)
2 The information disclosed for 2024 has a broader scope than the data reported in 2023 as it includes the category of "other non-hazardous waste". If the same 
scope as for 2023 were used, the total non-hazardous waste in 2024 would have been 46,355 tonnes.
3 The information disclosed for 2024 has a broader scope than the data reported in 2023 as it includes the category of "other non-hazardous waste". If the same 
scope as for 2023 were used, the total waste for 2024 would have been 52,305 tonnes.
4 The data on waste generated does not include reuse since the reused equipment has not yet reached the end of its useful life.
5 The information on waste diverted from disposal disclosed in 2024 has a different scope to the data reported in 2023 as it consolidates energy recovery as a 
result of the criterion established in requirement AR31 of ESRS E5. If the same scope as for 2023 were used, the total waste diverted from disposal would have 
been 62,245 tonnes.
6 The information on waste directed to disposal disclosed in 2024 has a different scope to the data reported in 2023 since it does not consolidate energy 
recovery as a result of the criterion established in requirement AR32 of ESRS E5. If the same scope as for 2023 were used, the total waste directed to disposal 
would have been 1,127 tonnes.
7 Other treatment includes: physical, chemical and biological treatment, security cells and intermediate treatment prior to recycling.

10 Dismissal means a Company decision to unilaterally terminate an employment contract. This concept does not include incentivised redundancies, which are 
part of restructuring processes..The breakdown of these indicators includes only male and female employees, in line with previous reports.
11 For the purposes of reporting the average total remuneration of all Telefónica Employees, all senior management positions at the Company have been 
grouped under the same category of “Senior Management”. This includes executives and pre-executives, given that the structure of the remuneration mix of 
both groups (fixed remuneration, annual variable remuneration, eligibility for the long-term incentive plan and other concepts) is aligned with the Telefónica 
Group's Global Remuneration Policy.
The average total remuneration includes all salary items paid during 2024, where applicable. These concepts are total base salary, bonuses, commissions and 
commercial incentives, long-term incentives and benefits in-kind, including social benefits, accrued over the year.

Gender Pay Gap calculation
In order to calculate the gender pay gap in each of the countries, the total 
average remuneration of women was subtracted from the total average 
remuneration of men, then divided by the total average remuneration of 
men.
The total average remuneration includes all salaries received by an 
employee for one year. These concepts are:
• Total annual base salary.
• Short-term variable remuneration: bonuses, commissions, sales 
incentives and other variable remuneration items paid.
• Benefits in kind, including social benefits, accumulated in one year.
• Long-term variable remuneration: incentives paid (shares).
The scope of this analysis includes all active employees in the Telefónica 
Group as at 31 December of the corresponding year.
In the case of the global gender pay gap, a weighted average of the gender 
pay gaps of each country according to the total number of employees in 
each country has been applied.

12 The 2024  figure is not comparable to the 2023 figure due to the addition of new factors in the calculation.
13 Data restated for an amount of 107,473 euros.
14 The 2023 figure has been recalculated considering calendar days, in alignment with the definition of lost days.
15 Based on the International Labour Organization List of Occupational Diseases. Lost day rate (severity) = (total number of days lost due to accidents in the 
workplace with leave and occupational disease / total hours worked per year) x 200,000. The 2023 data is recalculated to account for calendar lost days.
16 Based on the list of occupational diseases in local legislation, regulations and rules. Lost day rate (severity) = (total number of days lost due to accidents in the 
workplace with leave and occupational disease / total hours worked per year) x 200,000. The 2023 data is recalculated to account for calendar lost days.
17 Accident frequency rate = (total number of accidents in the workplace with leave / total number of hours worked per year) x 200,000.
18 Telefónica does not have information on the type of conditions resulting in sick leave or work-related injuries due to regulatory issues and the privacy of 
personal data.
19 For privacy reasons under German law, Telefónica does not collect information on the incidence of occupational diseases in Germany, and it is considered 
zero for the purposes of calculating rates.

20 The contribution by country to the consolidated Group's profit before tax is adjusted for the allocation to the year of the coupons corresponding to the 
subordinated perpetual debentures. The consolidated financial statements of the Telefónica Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The local accounting standards applicable in each of the countries in which the Group operates 
may differ from IFRS.
The table above groups all the Group companies according to the country of their registered office. This grouping does not coincide with the Telefónica Group's 
segment breakdown. The results by country include, where applicable, the effect of the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed. Likewise, results by country exclude dividend income from Group subsidiaries, as well as the change in the provision for impairment of investments in 
Group companies, which are eliminated on consolidation.
21 See previous footnote.
22 In 2024, refunds received from various administrations, which correspond to excess tax payments from previous years, are excluded; specifically, 216 million 
euros have been excluded in Spain and 13 million in Peru and Chile. 
Regarding 2023, 293 million euros have been excluded in Spain and 43 million in Peru and Chile. 
The withholdings paid by the various administrations have been attributed to the jurisdiction that actually bears them.

Limited assurance report issued by a practitioner
on the Consolidated Non-Financial Information
and Sustainability Information Statement

To the shareholders of Telefonica, S.A. on behalf of the directors

Limited assurance conclusion

Pursuant to article 49 of the Code of Commerce, we have conducted a limited assurance engagement
on the accompanying Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement (hereinafter “NFIS”) for the
year ended 31 December 2024 of Telefonica, S.A. (hereinafter the Parent company) and its
subsidiaries (hereinafter the Group), which forms part of the Group’s consolidated management
report.

The NFIS includes information in addition to that required by current commercial regulations on non-
financial information, specifically, it includes the Sustainability Information prepared by the Group for
the year ended 31 December 2024 (hereinafter, the sustainability information) in accordance with the
Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022, as
regards corporate sustainability reporting (CSRD). This sustainability information has also been
subject to limited assurance procedures.

Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come
to our attention that causes us to believe that:

a) the Group's Statement of Non-Financial Information for the year ended 31 December 2024 is
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with current commercial regulations and in
accordance with the selected criteria of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards
(ESRS), as well as with those other criteria described as mentioned for each topic in the table in
Chapter 2.17.1 of the aforementioned Statement;

b) the sustainability information as a whole is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance
with the sustainability reporting framework applied by the Group and which is identified in the
Chapter 2.1, including:

° That the description provided of the process for identifying the sustainability information
included in Chapter 2.3 is consistent with the process in place and enables the
identification of the material information to be disclosed in accordance with the
requirements of ESRS.

° Compliance with ESRS.

Telefonica, S.A. and its subsidiaries

e Compliance with the disclosure requirements, included in Chapter 2.8 of the
environmental section of the sustainability information with the provisions of article 8 of
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June
2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments.

Basis for conclusion

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with generally accepted professional
standards applicable in Spain and specifically in accordance with the guidelines contained in Guides
47 Revised and 56 issued by the Instituto de Censores Jurados de Cuentas de Espana on assurance
engagements regarding non-financial information and considering the contents of the note published
by the /nstituto de Contabilidad y Auditoria (\CAC) dated 18 December 2024 (hereinafter, generally
accepted professional standards).

In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures applied are less in extent than for a reasonable
assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance
engagement is lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance
engagement been performed.

Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the Practitioner's responsibilities
section of our report.

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of
Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code of Ethics), which is founded on
fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality
and professional behaviour.

The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design,
implement and operate a system of quality management including policies and procedures regarding
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
conclusion.

Responsibilities of the Parent company's directors

The preparation of the NFIS included in the Group's consolidated management report, as well as its
content, is the responsibility of the directors of Telefonica, S.A. The NFIS has been prepared in
accordance with prevailing commercial regulations and in accordance with the ESRS criteria selected,
as well as those other criteria described in accordance with the aforementioned for each topic in the
table in Chapter 2.17.1 of the aforementioned Statement.

This responsibility also encompasses designing, implementing and maintaining such internal control
as is determined to be necessary to enable the preparation of the NFIS that is free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The directors of Telefénica, S.A. are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and
maintaining the management systems from which the information necessary for the preparation of the
NFIS is obtained.

&
pwe

Telefonica, S.A. and its subsidiaries

With regard to the sustainability information, the Parent company's directors are responsible for
developing and implementing a process to identify the information that should be included in the
sustainability information in accordance with the CSRD, ESRS and as set out in article 8 of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020, and for disclosing
information about this process in the sustainability information itself in Chapter 2.3. This responsibility

includes:

° understanding the context in which the Group's business activities and relationships are
conducted, as well as its stakeholders, with regard to the Group's impacts on people and the
environment.

e identifying the actual and potential impacts (both negative and positive), as well as the risks and

opportunities that could affect, or could reasonably be expected to affect, the Group's financial
position, financial results, cash flows, access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium

or long term;
° assessing the materiality of the impacts, risks and opportunities identified; and
° making assumptions and estimates that are reasonable under the circumstances.

The Parent company's directors are also responsible for the preparation of the sustainability
information, which includes the information identified by the process, in accordance with the
sustainability reporting framework applied, including compliance with the CSRD, compliance with the
ESRS and compliance with the disclosure requirements included in Chapter 2.8 of the environmental
section of the sustainability information in accordance with the provisions of article 8 of Regulation
(EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment
of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment.

This responsibility includes:

e Designing, implementing and maintaining such internal control as the Parent company's
directors consider to be relevant to enable the preparation of sustainability information that is
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

° Selecting and applying appropriate methods for the presentation of sustainability information
and making assumptions and estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances about specific
disclosures.

Inherent limitations in preparing the information

In accordance with ESRS, the Parent company's directors are required to prepare prospective
information based on assumptions and hypotheses, which should be included in the sustainability
information, regarding events that could occur in the future, as well as possible future actions, where
appropriate, that the Group could take. Actual results may differ significantly from estimated results
since they refer to the future and future events often do not occur as expected.

In determining disclosures relating to sustainability information, the Parent company's directors
interpret legal and other terms that are not clearly defined and could be interpreted differently by
others, including the legality of such interpretations and, consequently, they are subject to uncertainty.

tk
pwe

Telefénica, S.A. and its subsidiaries

Practitioner's responsibilities

Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about
whether the NFIS and sustainability information are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error, and to issue a limited assurance report that includes our conclusion. Misstatements can
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence decisions of users taken on the basis of this information.

As part of a limited assurance engagement, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the engagement. We also:

° Design and perform procedures to assess whether the process for identifying the information
included in both the NFIS and the sustainability information is consistent with the description of
the process followed by the Group and enables, where appropriate, the identification of the
material information to be disclosed in accordance with ESRS requirements.

e Perform risk assessment procedures, including obtaining an understanding of internal control
relevant to the engagement, to identify the disclosures in respect of which material
misstatements are likely to arise, whether due to fraud or error, but not for the purpose of
providing a conclusion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

e Design and perform procedures responsive to where material misstatements are likely to arise
in the disclosures included in the NFIS and sustainability information. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of
internal control.

Summary of the work performed

A limited assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence to support our
conclusions. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on professional judgement,
including the identification of the disclosures where material misstatements are likely to arise, whether
due to fraud or error, in the NFIS and in the sustainability information.

Our work consisted of enquiries of management, as well as of various units and components of the
Group that were involved in the preparation of the NFIS and sustainability information, of the review of
the processes for compiling and validating the information presented in the NFIS and sustainability
information and of the application of certain analytical procedures and review procedures on a sample
basis, as described below:

In relation to the process of verifying the NFIS:

e Meetings with Group personnel to understand the business model, policies and management
approaches applied and the main risks related thereto, and obtaining the information required
for the external review.

® Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the content of the NFIS for the 2024 year
based on the materiality analysis performed by the Group and described in Chapter 2.3, taking
into account the content required under prevailing commercial legislation.

° Analysis of the processes to compile and validate the information presented in the NFIS for the
2024 year.
° Review of information concerning risks, policies and management approaches applied in

relation to material matters presented in the NFIS for the 2024 year.

&
pwe

Telefonica, S.A. and its subsidiaries

° Verification, by means of sample testing, of the information relating to the content of the NFIS
for the 2024 year and its adequate compilation using data obtained from the information
sources.

In relation to the process of verifying the sustainability information:
° Making enquiries of the Group's personnel:

- in order to understand the business model, policies and management approaches applied
and the main risks related thereto, and obtaining the information required for the external
review.

- in order to understand the source of the information used by management (for example,
engagement with stakeholders, business plans and strategy documents); and the review
the Group's internal documentation on its process.

e Obtaining, through enquiries of Group personnel, an understanding of the entity's relevant
processes for collecting, validating and presenting information for the preparation of its
sustainability information.

° Evaluating the consistency of the evidence obtained from our procedures on the process
implemented by the Group for determining the information that should be included in the
sustainability information with the description of the process included in such information, as
well as the evaluation of whether the aforementioned process implemented by the Group
enables the identification of material information to be disclosed according to ESRS
requirements.

e Evaluating whether all the information identified in the process implemented by the Group for
determining the information that should be included in the sustainability information is in fact
included.

e Evaluating the consistency of the structure and presentation of the sustainability information

with the requirements of ESRS and the rest of the regulatory framework on sustainability
information applied by the Group.

e Making enquiries of relevant personnel and performing analytical procedures on the information
disclosed in the sustainability information, considering such information in respect of which
material misstatements are likely to arise, whether due to fraud or error.

° Performing, where appropriate, substantive procedures on a sample basis on the information
disclosed in the selected sustainability information, considering such information in respect of
which material misstatements are likely to arise, whether due to fraud or error.

e Obtaining, where applicable, the reports issued by accredited independent third parties

3.1. Risk Management Framework
3.1.1. Introduction and reference 
frameworks
Telefónica has a Risk Management Framework, based 
on the model established by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
COSO(1) This framework has been implemented 
homogeneously throughout the Group’s main 
operations, so that the Company Managers, within their 
scope of action, can perform a timely identification, 
assessment, response and monitoring of the main risks.  
This model, which is inspired by best practices, 
facilitates the prioritisation and development of 
coordinated actions against risks, both from a global 
Group perspective and a specific focus on its main 
operations. 
Telefónica’s Business Principles specifically state that: 
“We establish appropriate controls to 
evaluate and manage all relevant risks 
to the Company”
Extract from Telefónica's Responsible Business Principles
Therefore, the Company has a Risk Management 
Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, and a 
Corporate Risk Management Procedure, both based 
on experience, best practices and Good Corporate 
Governance recommendations; this contributes to the 
continuous improvement in business performance.
3.1.2. Risks and strategy
Telefónica Risk management remains embedded in our 
planning process and is fully aligned with our strategy, in 
line with the requirements of COSO ERM 2017.

1 COSO ERM framework, “Enterprise Risk Management -Integrating with Strategy and Performance”, released in September 2017 by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). COSO is one of the most importance references on internal control, enterprise risk 
management and fraud deterrence. 

“The main risks are linked to the 
Company´s strategic targets”
 1.2. Strategy
Some of the risks most directly related to the Company’s 
strategy mainly concern evolving competition and 
market consolidation, mergers and acquisitions, the 
supply chain, ongoing technological changes and new 
uses of artificial intelligence (AI), as well as changes in 
customer preferences in the sector. 
3.1.3. Risk Management Governance 
The Responsible Business Principles and the 
aforementioned Risk Management Policy stipulate that 
the entire organisation is responsible for contributing to 
risk identification and management. In order to 
coordinate these activities, the Risk Management Policy 
establishes the following roles: 
Risk Management Governance 
Supervision of the Risk Management System
The Regulations of the Company’s Board of Directors 
state that the Audit and Control Committee (ACC) has 
the main function of supporting the Board of Directors in 
its supervisory duties, including, but not limited to, the 
following responsibilities: 
• Oversee the effectiveness of control and risk 
management systems, both financial and non-
financial, related to the Company and the Group 
(including operational, technological, legal, social, 
environmental, political and reputational or corruption-
related risks).
• Supervise the risk control and management unit.
Furthermore, the Audit and Control Committee reports 
regularly on these matters to the Board of Directors.

Risk Owners  
Risk owners actively participate in the risk strategy and 
in the important decisions about their management. To 
this end, each of the identified risks will be assigned an 
individual (typically an executive) with full responsibility 
for the risk and its management; the latter will produce a 
plan for its mitigation and effectively monitor its 
evolution.
Specifically, with respect to tax risks, the Group’s Tax 
Division performs the fiscal control function through the 
Regional Tax Divisions, and the local fiscal control 
officers in the different subsidiaries in accordance with 
the principles defined in the Group’s Tax Control Policy, 
approved by the Company's Board of Directors.
Further information is available in the Risk Management 
Policy on our corporate website. 
3.1.4. Tolerance or risk appetite
The Company has a level of risk tolerance or 
acceptable risk established at corporate level; this 
means it is willing to assume a certain level of risk, to the 
extent that it allows the creation of value and the 
development of the business, achieving an adequate 
balance between growth, performance and risk.
For the risk assessment, the different typology of the 
risks that could affect the Company is considered, as 
described below:
• In general, tolerance thresholds are defined for all 
risks, including tax risks, by combination of impact and 
probability of occurrence. These thresholds are 
updated annually based on the evolution of the main 
financial figures, both for the Group as a whole and for 
the main Telefónica companies.
• For risks associated with compliance, corruption and 
bribery, a zero-tolerance level is established.
3.1.5. Risk Management Process
The risk management process takes the Company’s 
strategy and objectives as a reference for the 
identification of the main risks that could affect its 
achievement. This process is carried out for the Group’s 
main operations twice a year. Similarly, an emergency 
reporting process is in place should managers become 
aware of a new risk or a significant change in an existing 
one.
The process consists of four stages, which are described 
below:
Risk Management Process 
Risk identification
The risks are identified by the managers, taking into 
account both the factors that cause them and the 
effects they may have on achieving the targets. 
In this identification phase, risks associated with the 
strategic plan are considered, as well as potential 
“emerging risks”, meaning those risks that could 
eventually have an adverse impact on future 
performance, although its outcome and time horizon is 
uncertain and difficult to predict.
Risk assessment
The objective of the risk assessment is to establish an 
order of magnitude or relevance of the risks, by 
considering both their eventual impact and their 
likelihood of occurrence.

For impact purposes, both the economic impact 
(quantified whenever possible in terms of operational 
cash flow, considering EBITDA plus CAPEX) and the 
ESG (environmental, social and governance) 
impact, as well as its potential impact on compliance. 
Risk assessment
Other qualitative additional factors are also considered, 
such as proximity, the historical trend, the level of 
assurance or control and their future outlook.
Risk response and action plans against risks
The Risk Management Model includes procedures to 
address risks generally through mitigation plans. 
The different types of risk response are described below:
Risk response 
In relation to risk response mechanisms, financial risks, 
such as those related to exchange rate or interest rate 
fluctuations, are primarily addressed through global 
actions, mainly involving the use of financial derivatives. 
In relation to tax risks, the main issues identified are 
monitored. Similarly, for a large part of operational risks, 
the Group uses Multinational insurance Programmes, or 
insurance policies negotiated locally in each country, 
depending on the type of risk and cover required.
Monitoring and reporting
In accordance with the different typology of risks, the 
monitoring and response mechanisms include global 
initiatives, promoted and coordinated in a homogeneous 
way in the main operating businesses of the Group, and/
or actions specifically aimed at addressing specific risks 
in some companies at the local level.

3.1.6. Perspectives of the Risk 
Management Model
In order to have a comprehensive model, oriented to the 
needs and the Group’s own configuration, the ERM 
Framework considers a risk assessment through two 
complementary perspectives:  
Perspectives of the Risk Management Model
3.1.7. Interdependence of risks and 
scenario analysis
In addition to the individual assessment of each of the risks, 
the Telefónica Group evaluates the interdependence of the 
risks. In other words, if a risk materialises, it may impact 
other risks within the model, thereby making them more 
critical. In this regard, an analysis of the correlation levels 
between risks is conducted in collaboration with risk 
management areas.
By way of example, we can point to the relationship 
between cybersecurity risks, supply chain or alignment 
with the economic and political context, heightened by 
military conflicts and geopolitical uncertainty. 
This approach also allows for sensitivity analysis or stress 
testing by increasing, to varying degrees, the 
interdependence between model risks in adverse 
situations (e.g. operational resilience, cybersecurity, 
ESG, etc.).

3.1.8. Risk culture
In accordance with the provisions of Telefónica’s Risk 
Management Policy, one of the basic principles that 
guide this activity is: “Train and involve employees in the 
risk management culture, encouraging them to identify 
risks and actively participate in their mitigation”.
In this regard, Telefónica promotes the following actions:
Communication
With the aim of disseminating the principles and values that should govern risk management, awareness 
campaigns are run through the Company’s various communication channels. 
Training
Various training activities are carried out, including online courses and videos on risk management available 
to the Company’s employees, as well as risk training sessions for the Audit and Control Committee.
“Training workshops and global 
awareness campaigns are run to 
strengthen the risk management 
culture in the Company”
3.1.9. Digitalisation of risk 
management
With the aim of managing and supervising risks, 
Telefónica has a Risk Management tool (eRisk) and a 
Dashboard, which facilitate the reporting, analysis, 
assessment and management of risk information within 
the Telefónica Group. These tools are common to all 
Group Companies that report risks, and their main 
features are as follows:
“Continuous improvements to risk 
management tools are developed to 
improve or expand their features”

3.2. Risk Profile
Taking the targets identified in the Company’s Strategic 
Plan as a reference, those risks that could affect their 
achievement are identified.
Furthermore, those emerging risks that could impact the 
long-term development of the Company or the sector 
are considered, alongside ESG-related risks.
An assessment of the impact and probability of the 
identified risks is carried out, which facilitates their 
prioritisation and the definition of response plans to 
mitigate them, ensuring the necessary coordination 
between global and local initiatives. 
On this basis, the Company’s risk map is drawn up. It is 
presented twice a year to the Audit and Control 
Committee of Telefónica S.A., based on the 
corresponding risk maps approved by the Management 
Committees of the Group companies, also taking into 
account the input received from the global areas for its 
final assessment and subsequent publication.

3.2.1. Telefónica’s risk catalogue
In order to facilitate the risk identification process by the 
Company's management, the Telefónica Group has a 
general risk (or taxonomy) catalogue, updated regularly, 
allowing the information to be homogenised and 
consolidated and to comply with the internal and 
external reporting requirements on the main risks.
Telefónica’s risk catalogue considers the following four 
risk categories:  
Business
Risks related to the sector and especially to the Company’s strategy, such as evolving competition and 
market consolidation, the regulatory framework, the supply chain, technological innovation, AI, data privacy, 
talent management, adaptation to changing customer demands and/or the development of new ethical or 
social standards, as well as reputational risks.
Operational
Cybersecurity-related risks; climate change, natural disasters and other factors that may cause physical 
damage to our technical infrastructures, which may result in network failures, service disruptions or loss of 
quality; customer-related risks; personnel risks, as well as operational management. 
Financial
Risks arising from adverse changes in the economic environment or financial variables, as well as the 
Company’s ability to meet its obligations, liquidate its assets and secure financing to implement the business 
plan, including tax-related matters. 
Legal and of regulatory compliance
Risks related to litigation and regulatory compliance, including anti-corruption legislation, as well as 
compliance with legal obligations and the Company’s own ESG targets. 
This catalogue is regularly updated, taking into account 
the current dynamic context and the new synergies that 
have emerged between risks, with risks related to 
intangibles and those of global significance becoming 
more prevalent, such as ESG aspects, in addition to 
other issues, such as the geopolitical environment, 
supply chain problems, technological changes and new 
uses of AI.
3.2.2. Main risks and opportunities 
from an ESG perspective 
Given the nature of the business and its sustainability 
context, we are exposed to various types of 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. For their 
identification and assessment, a procedure has been 
followed as part of the 2024 double materiality process. 
Furthermore, the material risks and their management 
are described in each of the material standards.
 2.3.1.3. Identification and assessment of impacts, risks and 
opportunities
3.2.3. Risk Observatory  
In order to regularly update the Company’s general risk 
catalogue and identify potential emerging risks, 
Telefónica conducts the following activities through the 
risk observatory on an ongoing basis:
Analysis of the global context and risk 
trends.
Analysis of external benchmarks (risk reports 
from international organisations or 
consultancies) and benchmarking of the 
leading companies in the telecommunications 
and digital sector.
Participation in expert risk forums and 
meetings with risk managers from Ibex 35 
companies.
3.2.4. Emerging risks
In the process of identifying new risks, Telefónica also 
considers emerging risks.
Emerging risks are those issues identified recently and 
which are expected to have an adverse impact on the 
future development of the Company or the sector in the 
long term, although its outcome and time horizon is still 
uncertain and difficult to predict.

As emerging risks to consider in a long-term 
scenario, the following should be highlighted:
Cybercrime and/or 
cyberespionage
Inappropriate use 
of artificial intelligence
Disinformation and the spread 
of false or inaccurate information.
• Cybercrime and cyber espionage:
Description: The value of the intellectual property of 
large companies and the importance of the services they 
provide to society, together with existing geopolitical 
tensions, bring into play both state-backed and 
independent actors with significant financial resources. 
The financial resources available to cybercriminals drive 
the proliferation of advanced digital tools that use 
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning, enabling more sophisticated and 
automated cyber attacks that may lead to an increase in 
cybercrime in general, including cyber espionage.
Impact: This could harm the Group’s operations, image 
or business, and may also affect its customers or third 
parties, including data and intellectual property theft.
Mitigation measures: Telefónica Group’s strategy, 
based on anticipation as its first pillar, includes measures 
already in place to protect, identify, detect, mitigate and 
neutralise actions before they occur, or as early 
detection measures, as described in the Global 
Transparency Centre available on Telefónica’s public 
website. To monitor these threats, proactive measures 
include continuous asset monitoring to detect 
vulnerabilities, as well as analysing threats and actors’ 
activities to produce cyber intelligence. Should the 
adopted measures not completely prevent damage to 
systems or data, there are backup systems designed to 
completely or partially retrieve information, as well as 
insurance programmes and coverage that include cyber 
risks, as stated in the section “Operational risks - 
Information technology is an important element of our 
business and is exposed to cybersecurity risks” in 
chapter 3.3 Risk Factors.
• Inappropriate Use of AI:
Description: Risks associated with failures in AI-based 
systems and compliance-related risks. The use of AI 
systems for network management, customer service or 
security could lead to problems if the systems fail, 
provide inaccurate results or are not interpreted 
correctly. Furthermore, an implementation of AI systems 
that does not correctly comply with the new AI 
regulations and Telefónica’s AI principles may lead to 
regulatory issues with the authorities and reputational 
issues with our customers. Lastly, possible risks 
concerning privacy, security and proprietary and third-
party intellectual property may also arise.
Impact: the absence of controls in the different risk 
contexts associated with AI could cause reputational 
damage to the Group and lead to a loss of trust among 
customers and users. This would have a negative impact 
on the Group’s business, the financial position, operating 
results and/or cash flows.
Mitigation measures: the various contexts will be 
managed through a continuous improvement cycle 
involving risk analyses, taking into account privacy, 
intellectual property, security, fundamental rights, the 
environment and society as a whole. All of this is 
governed by an internal model applied to the 
development, acquisition, marketing and use of AI 
systems at Telefónica.
• Disinformation and the spread of false or 
inaccurate information:
Description: this risk relates to the proliferation and 
dissemination of incorrect or misleading information, 
whether deliberate or not, through various content 
generation platforms. Misinformation covers all forms of 
false or inaccurate information, including:  completely 
fabricated information with no basis in reality (false 
content); information that is falsely presented as 
originating from a reliable source when it does not 
(imposter content); information that has been 
misleadingly altered to change its original meaning 
(manipulated content); as well as information created ad 
hoc with the intention of deliberately deceiving the 
public (fabricated content).

Impact: misinformation can negatively affect the public 
perception of the Company, eroding the trust of 
customers and investors, including potential ones, as 
well as other parties interested in our brand and/or our 
services. Misinformation may also lead to incorrect 
decision making by our investors, generate uncertainty 
in the market and negatively affect our financial and 
operational position. Furthermore, managing 
misinformation requires significant resources to monitor, 
identify and counteract false information, which could 
result in the Company incurring additional costs.
Mitigation measures: The accidental dissemination of 
inaccurate information, alongside that which is 
deliberately misleading and spread with the aim of 
causing serious harm, pose a past, present and future 
challenge. To address this, stronger cooperation is 
required between company departments in direct 
contact with content platforms. Telefónica's 
Communications Department remains firmly committed 
to best practices in order to provide sufficient, accurate 
and reliable information, as well as to prevent its own 
activity from causing negative consequences by 
applying ongoing policies to combat misinformation and 
uphold an ethical and rigorous public stance. These 
procedures are followed at all times in accordance with 
the recommendations of both the United Nations 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council, 
ensuring that responses to the dissemination of 
misinformation always promote and protect individuals’ 
freedom of expression and the freedom to seek, receive 
and share information, as established by Article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 19(1) 
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights. The Communications Department also reinforces 
its commitment to creating a multifaceted civic space 
and media landscape, with a range of procedures to 
mitigate misinformation by maximising transparency, 
generating trust in the company’s governance and its 
stakeholders and facilitating an ongoing debate and 
dialogue with the media. Fostering critical thinking skills 
is another strategic lever available to identify, combat 
and dispel the spread of misinformation, whatever its 
purpose. Likewise, there is an ongoing responsibility to 
work to involve the media in policy design and other 
responsible efforts to counter misinformation and 
promote the highest standards of professionalism, with 
unwavering dialogue and availability. The 
Communications Department bases its action plan on a 
strong foundation of publicly available information, with 
sufficient resources in all the places in which it operates 
and in all relevant languages and contexts, monitoring 
the content disseminated about the Company globally 
with the appropriate technical and human resources. In 
addition, this department develops and evolves the 
channels through which the public can request or verify 
any information necessary for their own legitimate 
activities.
3.2.5. Materialised risks
The Company monitors materialised risks. The strategy 
and management of Telefónica Group's activities tend to 
minimise the impact of materialised risks, as well as to 
counterbalance the negative effects of some issues with 
the favourable evolution of others.
Geopolitical events during the year, including the 
Russia-Ukraine war, armed conflict and political 
instability in the Middle East, among other factors, have 
affected various areas and operations within the 
Company, with the most important aspects and their 
impact being highlighted in section 3.3 Risk Factors.
In this regard and in accordance with current 
accounting standards, the Telefónica Group reviews on 
an annual basis, or more frequently when the 
circumstances require it, the need to introduce changes 
to the book value of its goodwill, deferred tax assets or 
other assets, such as intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment. In the case of goodwill, the 
potential loss of value is determined by analysing the 
recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (or group 
of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill is 
allocated at the time when it is first recognised, and this 
calculation requires significant assumptions and 
judgements. In 2024, Telefónica recorded impairment 
losses on intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment in Argentina in an aggregate amount of 1,274 
million euros and impairment losses on goodwill in an 
aggregate amount of 866 million euros with respect to 
the cash-generating units in Chile (397 million euros), 
Peru (226 million euros), Telefónica Tech UK & Ireland 
(192 million euros) and BE-terna Group (51 million euros). 
Likewise, impairment losses were recorded in Peru in 
2024, including impairment losses on intangible assets 
(54 million euros) and on goodwill allocated to the fiber 
optics business (34 million euros), as well as a reversal of 
deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards (91 million 
euros). Additionally, following the analysis of the 
recoverability of the assets of Pangea (the wholesale 
fiber optic company in Peru) at the end of 2024, an 
impairment of property, plant and equipment amounting 
to 108 million euros has been recorded, as well as a 
reversal of deferred tax assets amounting to 13 million 
euros (see Notes 2, 6, 7, 8, 25 and 30 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements). 
In addition, Telefónica may not be able to realise 
deferred tax assets on its statement of financial position 
to offset future taxable income. The recoverability of 
deferred tax assets depends on the Group’s ability to 
generate taxable income over the period for which the 
deferred tax assets remain deductible. If Telefónica 
believes it is unable to utilise its deferred tax assets 
during the applicable period, it may be required to 
record an impairment against them resulting in a non-
cash charge on the income statement. 
Further impairments of goodwill, deferred tax or other 
assets may occur in the future and this may materially

3.2.6. Main risks
The risks of Telefónica Group are prioritised based on 
their level of criticality, which is obtained from the 
combination of impact and likelihood assessments for 
each of them.
For public disclosure purposes, Telefónica’s risks are 
presented under four categories, as described above, 
presenting the risk factors in descending order of 
importance within each category, in line with the 
requirements of ESMA (European Securities and 
Markets Authority).
The detail on the main risk factors disclosed by the 
Company is included in the following section.

3.3. Risk Factors
The Telefónica Group’s business is affected by a series 
of risk factors that affect exclusively the Group, as well 
as a series of factors that are common to businesses of 
the same sector. The main risks and uncertainties faced 
by Telefónica, that could affect its business, financial 
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows are set 
out below and must be considered jointly with the 
information set out in the rest of this Annual Report.   .
These risks are currently considered by the Telefónica 
Group to be material, specific and relevant in making an 
informed investment decision in respect of Telefónica. 
However, the Telefónica Group is subject to other risks 
that have not been included in this section based on the 
Telefónica Group’s assessment of their specificity and 
materiality based on the Telefónica Group’s assessment 
of their probability of occurrence and the potential 
magnitude of their impact. The assessment of the 
potential impact of any risk is both quantitative and 
qualitative considering, among other things, potential 
economic, compliance, reputational and environmental, 
social and governance ("ESG") impacts.
Risks are presented in this section grouped into four 
categories: business, operational, financial, and legal and 
compliance.These categories are not presented in order 
of importance. However, within each category, the risk 
factors are presented in descending order of 
importance, as determined by Telefónica at the date of 
this document. Telefónica may change its vision about 
their relative importance at any time, especially if new 
internal or external events arise.
Risks related to Telefónica's 
Business Activities. 
Telefónica's competitive position in some 
markets could be affected by the evolution of 
competition and market consolidation. 
The Telefónica Group operates in highly competitive 
markets and it is possible that the Group may not be 
able to market its products and services effectively or 
respond successfully to the different commercial actions 
carried out by its competitors, causing it to not meet its 
growth and customer retention plans, thereby 
jeopardizing its future revenues and profitability.
Additionally, the Telefónica Group could be affected by 
the regulatory actions of antitrust authorities. These 
authorities could prohibit certain actions, such as new 
acquisitions or specific practices, create obligations or 
impose heavy fines. Any such measures implemented by 
the antitrust authorities could result in economic and/or 
reputational loss for the Group, in addition to a loss of 
market share and/or harm to the future growth of some 
of its businesses.
The entry of new competitors in core markets 
(leveraging asymmetric regulation and wholesale 
obligations for incumbents), market concentration via 
mergers by other players (e.g. MasOrange in Spain and 
Vodafone/Three in the United Kingdom) or changes in 
control at key competitors (e.g. Vodafone – Zegona in 
Spain), may re-configure markets. This could affect 
Telefónica’s relative competitive position, impacting the 
potential evolution of revenues and market share, 
especially if new entrants pursue aggressive customer 
acquisition strategies. Additionally, new entrants could 
decide to accelerate network rollout (e.g. 5G) aiming at 
differentiating in the market, which could lead to 
increased competition in infrastructure.
Today most telecom operators, such as Telefónica, 
include services beyond core connectivity services in 
their portfolio, albeit the weight of these services is 
relatively minor. Competitive dynamics for digital 
services are different, since these markets are 
dominated by specialized over-the-top (OTT) players 
and big tech, which leverage global platform economics 
and strong customer brands.
If Telefónica is not able to successfully face these 
challenges, by ensuring a supply of cutting-edge 
technology products and services and maintaining its 
competitiveness against current or future competitors, 
the Group's business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows could be adversely 
affected.
Telefónica could be affected by disruptions in 
the supply chain or international trade 
restrictions, or by the dependency on its 
suppliers.
The existence of critical suppliers in the supply chain, 
especially in areas such as network infrastructure, 
information systems or handsets with a high 
concentration in a small number of suppliers, poses risks 
that may affect Telefónica’s operations. In the event that 
a participant in the supply chain engages in practices 
that do not meet acceptable standards or does not meet 
Telefónica’s performance expectations (including delays 
in the completion of projects or deliveries, poor-quality 
execution, cost deviations, reduced output due to the 
suppliers own stock shortfalls, or inappropriate

practices), this may harm Telefónica's reputation, or 
otherwise adversely affect its business, financial 
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
Further, in certain countries, Telefónica may be exposed 
to labour contingencies in connection with the 
employees of such suppliers.   
As of December 31, 2024, the Group depended on three 
handset suppliers (one of them located in China) and 
seven network infrastructure suppliers (two of them 
located in China), which, together, accounted for 85% 
and 83%, respectively, of the aggregate value of 
contracts awarded in 2024 to handset suppliers and 
network infrastructure suppliers, respectively. One of the 
handset suppliers (not located in China) represented 
46% of the aggregate value of contracts awarded in 
2024 to handset suppliers. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Telefónica Group had 
approximately 100 information system ("IT") providers 
that together accounted for 80% of the total amount of 
IT purchase awards made in 2024, seven of them 
representing 30% of purchases in that area and time 
frame.
If suppliers cannot supply their products to the 
Telefónica Group within the agreed deadlines or such 
products and services do not meet the Group’s 
requirements, this could hinder the deployment and 
expansion plans of the network. This could in certain 
cases affect Telefónica’s compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the licenses under which it operates, or 
otherwise adversely affect the business and operating 
results of the Telefónica Group. 
In addition, the possible adoption of new protectionist 
measures in certain parts of the world, including, the 
imposition of tariffs by major economies, the adoption of 
lockdown or other restrictive measures as a result any 
crisis or pandemic, as well as disruptions derived from 
geopolitical events such as the Russia-Ukraine war, 
armed conflict and political instability in the Middle East, 
among others, could disrupt global supply chains or may 
have an adverse impact on certain of Telefónica’s 
suppliers and other players in the industry. Any of the 
above could increase prices for Telefónica and 
ultimately make our services more expensive for our 
customers, which could adversely affect the business 
and operating results of the Telefónica Group. 
National security concerns may also limit Telefónica’s 
ability to utilize certain suppliers and require it to incur 
additional costs. Several EU countries have imposed 
restrictions on the use of telecom suppliers that are 
considered high-risk for 5G network infrastructure, such 
as certain Chinese suppliers. In Germany, Telefónica and 
other mobile network operators have entered into public 
law contracts with the Federal Ministry of the Interior 
and Community that obligate the mobile network 
operators to stop using all critical components made by 
Chinese suppliers in their 5G core networks by the end 
of 2026. The operators are also required to replace the 
critical functions of such suppliers’ 5G network 
management systems in the access and transport 
networks of the 5G mobile network with technical 
solutions of other manufacturers by the end of 2029. 
This requires the cooperation of the suppliers, who must 
provide open interfaces for controlling the network 
elements.
The semiconductor industry in particular is facing 
various challenges, as a result mainly of supply problems 
at a global level, which in turn is affecting multiple 
sectors (including technology) through delivery delays 
and price increases, which could affect the Telefónica 
Group or others who are relevant to its business, 
including its customers, suppliers and partners. Since 
2021 a specific monitoring has been carried out and 
action plans have been developed by the Group with 
respect to the supply chain challenges resulting from 
the armed conflict in Ukraine as well as the potential 
discontinuation of use of some suppliers as a result of 
tensions between the United States and China. While 
Telefónica's supply chain has been generally resilient in 
recent years, despite various stresses affecting the 
semiconductor industry and raw materials, this may 
change in the future.
The imposition of trade restrictions and any disruptions 
in the supply chain, such as those related to international 
transport, could result in higher costs and lower margins 
or affect the ability of the Telefónica Group to offer its 
products and services and could adversely affect the 
Group's business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows.
Further, in its sale of digital services, the Telefónica 
Group regularly integrates the digital services it offers 
with third-party technologies. Similar to more traditional 
supplier relationships, these integrations subject the 
Telefónica Group to the risks of performance failures by 
these third parties and the cost of continuously 
monitoring these strategic partners to ensure they 
maintain appropriate levels of accreditation and that the 
technologies they provide remain secure and up to date. 
Any such performance failure by the third parties or the 
technologies they provide could negatively impact the 
digital services offered by the Telefónica Group, and the 
Group's business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows could be adversely 
affected as a result.
Telefónica could be affected by the global 
technology talent shortage and the need for 
new skills in the workforce due to rapid 
technological changes, which may limit the 
Group's competitiveness.
The changing need for new skills in the workforce due to 
ongoing technological disruptions and the shortage of

technology talent in the marketplace pose significant 
risks that may affect the Group's competitiveness.
The successful execution of Telefónica's strategic plan 
and Telefónica's ability to compete effectively now and 
in the future depend to a large extent on the Company's 
key talent, as well as on a highly skilled workforce. 
Experienced profiles in the technology sector are in high 
demand and competition for talent is fierce worldwide. A 
lack of talent and the necessary skills in the Group can 
slow down innovation and adaptation to rapid changes 
in the sector, impacting business opportunities and the 
quality of services provided. 
While the Group takes various steps to manage these 
risks, including by fostering a culture of continuous 
learning, though ambitious employee training and 
reskilling programs, motivating and seeking to retain the 
Group's key talent and by redefining Telefónica's 
corporate culture to ensure the company's long-term 
growth and sustainability, there can be no assurance 
that such steps will be sufficient.
If the Group fails to attract and retain technology talent, 
this could negatively affect the Group's business, 
financial condition, results of operations and/or cash 
flows.
The Group requires government concessions 
and licenses for the provision of a large part of 
its services and the use of spectrum, which is a 
scarce and costly resource. 
Many of the Group’s activities (such as the provision of 
telephone services, Pay TV, the installation and 
operation of telecommunications networks, use of 
spectrum, etc.) require licenses, concessions or 
authorizations from governmental authorities, which 
typically require that the Group satisfies certain 
obligations, including minimum specified quality levels, 
and service and coverage conditions. If the Telefónica 
Group breaches any of such obligations, it may suffer 
consequences such as fines or other measures that 
would affect the continuity of its business. In addition, in 
certain jurisdictions, the terms of granted licenses may 
be modified before the expiration date of such licenses 
or, at the time of the renewal of a license, new 
enforceable obligations could be imposed or the 
renewal of a license could be refused. 
In addition, the Telefónica Group requires sufficient 
appropriate spectrum to offer its services. The intention 
of the Group is to maintain current spectrum capacity 
and, if possible, to expand it, through the participation of 
the Group in spectrum auctions which are expected to 
take place in the next few years, which will likely require 
cash outflows to obtain additional spectrum or to 
comply with the coverage requirements associated with 
some of the related licenses. While Telefónica considers 
its current spectrum capacity to be sufficient in all the 
regions in which Telefónica operates, the Group's failure 
to retain or obtain sufficient or appropriate spectrum 
capacity in these jurisdictions in the future, or its inability 
to assume the related costs, could have an adverse 
impact on its ability to maintain the quality of existing 
services and on its ability to launch and provide new 
services, which may materially adversely affect 
Telefónica’s business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows.
Any of the foregoing, as well as the additional matters 
addressed below, could have an adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition, results of operations and/or 
cash flows of the Group.
Access to new concessions/ licenses of spectrum.
In Spain, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital 
Transformation (currently the Ministry of Digital 
Transformation and Civil Service) approved in June 2023 
a modification to the National Frequency Allocation 
Table ("CNFA"), allowing for the possibility of making 
available 450 MHz of the 26 GHz spectrum band, to 
companies, industries and organizations operating in a 
specific sector, that deploy private networks to support 
their connectivity needs (verticals). This could mean 
more competition in the private corporate network 
segment. 
In the UK, following the clearance of the merger 
between Vodafone UK and Three UK, the Office of 
Communications ("Ofcom") has confirmed that it will 
hold an auction for 26 GHz and 40 GHz bands in the 
third quarter of 2025. 
In Latin America, the following 5G auction processes are 
expected in 2025: in Peru, on July 4, 2024, a law was 
approved that allows the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications (MTC) to advance in the process of 
reordering the 3.5GHz band so that it can be used for 
the provision of 5G services and assign 5G spectrum 
without launching a public bidding process, as long as 
there is no lack of available spectrum to cover the 
demand of all interested operators. There is no specific 
information on when the MTC could advance in the 
process of reordering and assigning spectrum of the 
3.5GHz band. On September 20, 2023, after an 
employee presented a false document regarding his 
academic degree, Telefónica del Perú was disqualified 
following a decision of the government procurement 
supervisor (OSCE), from contracting with the Peruvian 
state for a period of 36 months, meaning it cannot 
request concessions for spectrum or participate as a 
contractor or subcontractor in any government tender 
process. Telefónica del Perú has initiated legal actions 
against the sanction resolution, and the aforementioned 
employee was fired and criminally prosecuted. 
Telefónica del Perú has concessions for the provision of 
public telecommunications services and 4G and 5G 
spectrum (including in the same 3.5 GHz band, but

obtained in a previous auction) with validity that exceeds 
the disqualification period. In addition, this 
disqualification does not affect the renewals of 
Telefónica del Perú licenses and we expect it would not 
preclude Telefónica del Perú from accessing additional 
spectrum for the provision of 5G services through the 
reordering process provided for in the July 4, 2024 law.
In Brazil, the Agencia Nacional de Telecomunicações 
(“ANATEL”) is conducting a public consultation (until 
April 7, 2025) about a long-term schedule for spectrum 
auctions. This proposal includes frequencies in multiple 
bands for awards in the short (2026–2028), medium 
(2029–2032) and long term (2032–2036). With regard to 
700 MHz in the 6 GHz band (6425–7125 MHz), ANATEL 
plans on submitting rules for the award to consultation in 
the second half of 2025 and granting the award by 2026. 
In addition, on January 31, 2025, ANATEL concluded the 
public consultation on the 700 MHz band Auction 
Proposal, which involves the spectrum that was 
returned by the provider Winity in 2023. According to 
the proposal, regional lots would be offered, with priority 
for participation given to providers that do not yet have 
spectrum authorizations in the 700 MHz band, and only 
if there is no interest from these providers, established 
providers would be able to acquire spectrum. The 
auction is expected to take place by the second half of 
2025. 
Existing licenses: renewal processes and modification of 
conditions for operating services.
In Germany, in May 2024, the Bundesnetzagentur 
(“BNetzA”) published a draft decision on the extension of 
the frequencies at 800 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2.6 GHz, 
which will partially expire at the end of 2025. The draft 
decision provides for the existing frequency usage rights 
in the above mentioned frequency ranges, to be 
extended for a transitional period of five years. It is 
expected that BNetzA will adopt a final decision in the 
first quarter of 2025. The extension of the usage rights 
would be accompanied by obligations for the further 
deployment of mobile networks, particularly in rural 
areas and along transport routes. There would also be a 
requirement to negotiate with MVNOs on the purchase 
of wholesale mobile services as well as an obligation to 
negotiate national roaming and a co-operative shared 
frequency usage below 1 GHz with 1&1 Mobilfunk GmbH 
(“1&1”). Finally, an obligation would be imposed to 
continue existing spectrum leasing arrangements 
between network operators. As part of a second set of 
actions, a larger procedural framework is expected to be 
established for utilization from 2031 onwards, including 
with respect to rights of use and new frequency ranges 
that expire in 2033 or become newly available for mobile 
communications in the coming years. A decision on this 
set of actions is planned for 2028. 
In the UK, mobile spectrum licenses are generally 
indefinite in term, subject to an annual fee set after a 
fixed period (usually 20 years) from the initial auction. In 
2033, after this mentioned fixed period, Ofcom will set 
spectrum fees for 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands. VMO2 
currently holds spectrum in both of these bands. 
With respect to Latin America: 
In Brazil, ANATEL approved on February 8, 2021, 
Resolution 741/2021 which sets the regulation for the 
transition from the existing concession regime to a new 
authorization model for the provision of fixed commuted 
telephony services (“STFC”). On December 16, 2024, 
Telefônica Brasil, ANATEL, the Brazilian Federal Court of 
Accounts and the Brazilian Ministry of Communications 
signed an agreement on the terms and conditions for 
the adaptation of the STFC concession contracts to an 
authorization instrument (the “Self-Composition 
Agreement”). The Self-Composition Agreement includes 
several key conditions: (i) Telefônica Brasil is required to 
make specific investments on terms established under 
the agreement; (ii) Telefônica Brasil must maintain the 
provision of fixed-line telephone services in certain  
locations without adequate competition, within the 
concession area until December 31, 2028; (iii) all pending 
administrative and judicial proceedings related to the 
concession at ANATEL or in the courts must be resolved, 
and Telefônica Brasil must withdraw any cases filed 
against the regulator; and (iv) Telefônica Brasil must 
commit to fulfilling public interest pledges for up to ten 
years as part of the adaptation process. Completion of 
the migration to the authorization regime is conditioned 
upon the signing of a unified authorization term with 
ANATEL, compiling all previous licenses into one single 
title, which is expected to occur during the first quarter 
of 2025.
ANATEL agreed to extend authorizations of the currently 
existing bands of 850MHz until November 2028, of 
900/1800 MHz between 2031 and 2035 (depending on 
the region), and of 2100 MHz, until 2038. Additionally, 
pursuant to Resolution n° 757/2022, ANATEL intends to 
carry out, respectively, a refarming action consisting of 
the promotion of changes in the channel arrangements 
of the 850 MHz (2028) and 900/1800 MHz (2032) sub-
bands.  Certain specific requirements imposed for these 
renewals, including those related to the valuation criteria 
and obligations, are still under review by the Federal 
Court of Accounts.
In Peru, an arbitration process was started by Telefónica 
del Perú, to challenge the decision adopted by the 
Ministry of Transportation and Communications 
(“MTC”), denying the renewal of concessions for the 
provision of fixed-line services, valid until 2027, which 
ended with a favorable award for Telefónica del Perú. 
The award recognizes that the methodology applied to 
assess compliance with the concession obligations in

the concession renewal process was not in accordance 
with the provisions of the concession contract. The 
MTC, following this award, has initiated a new evaluation 
of Telefónica's request of renewal of these concessions 
for the period 2027-2032. In any case, Telefónica del 
Perú S.A.A. holds other concessions for the provision of 
fixed-line services that allow it to provide these services 
beyond 2027. The renewal of the 1900 MHz band in all of 
Peru, except for Lima and Callao, which expired in 2018, 
and of other licenses to offer telecommunications 
services were requested by the Group and a decision by 
the MTC is still pending. Nevertheless, these 
concessions are valid while the procedures are in 
progress. 
In Ecuador, the concession contract that authorizes the 
provision of telecommunication services by Telefónica 
and includes the spectrum licenses (25 MHz in the 850 
MHz band and 60 MHz in the 1900 MHz band) that 
expired in November 2023, was extended on several 
occasions, with the last extension being authorized until 
May 15, 2025, under the same conditions as the original 
contract through an addendum and through provisional 
payments applicable to the new concession rights. At 
the end of 2024, the negotiation process for the renewal 
of the concession contract for a 15-year period was 
suspended by the Telecommunications Regulation and 
Control Agency (ARCOTEL) because it requires a 
favorable opinion from the Ministry of Economy and 
Finance (MEF) in relation to the terms and conditions 
agreed for the renewal. Once the opinion of the MEF is 
issued, we expect that the negotiations will resume.
During 2024, the Group’s consolidated investment in 
spectrum acquisitions and renewals amounted to 157 
million euros, mainly due to the acquisition of spectrum 
in Colombia (183 million euros in 2023, mainly due to the 
acquisition of spectrum in Argentina). In the event that 
the licenses mentioned above are renewed or new 
spectrum is acquired, it would involve additional 
investments by Telefónica. 
Further information on certain key regulatory matters 
affecting the Telefónica Group and the concessions and 
licenses of the Telefónica Group can be found in 
Appendix VI "Key regulatory issues and concessions and 
licenses held by the Telefónica Group" of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Telefónica operates in a sector characterized 
by rapid technological changes and it may not 
be able to anticipate or adapt to such changes 
or select the right investments to make.  
The pace of innovation and Telefónica's ability to keep 
up with its competitors is a critical issue in a sector so 
affected by technology such as telecommunications. In 
this sense, significant additional investments will be 
needed in new high-capacity network infrastructures to 
enable Telefónica to offer the features that new services 
will demand, through the development of technologies 
such as 5G or fiber.
New products and technologies are constantly 
emerging that can render products and services offered 
by the Telefónica Group, as well as its technology, 
obsolete. In addition, the explosion of the digital market 
and the entrance of new players in the communications 
market, such as mobile network virtual operators 
("MNVOs"), internet companies, technology companies 
or device manufacturers, could result in a loss of value 
for certain of the Group's assets, affect the generation of 
revenues, or otherwise cause Telefónica to have to 
update its business model. In this respect, revenues from 
traditional voice businesses have been shrinking in 
recent years, while revenues from connectivity services 
(e.g., fixed and mobile internet) are increasing. To 
diversify revenue sources, Telefónica offers new digital 
services such as Internet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, 
Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and cloud services among 
others. Although these services still have a substantially 
lower weight in Telefónica's total revenues, the related 
revenues represented more than 40% of the Company's 
B2B revenues in 2024 and grew by double digits 
compared to 2023. 
Additionally, the world of telecommunications is evolving 
towards a model of programmable networks and 
services. This type of network can be used by 
programmers in a completely new and different way 
than it had been in the past. As a first big step, the 
GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications) is 
leading the Open Gateway initiative for the standardized 
exposure of APIs (Application Programming Interface) to 
developers. This is a totally new market in which 
telecommunications companies must be able to develop 
not only attractive services but new skills in order to be 
successful.
One of the technologies currently being developed by 
telecommunications operators, including Telefónica (in 
Spain and Latin America), is the FTTx type networks 
which allow the offering of broadband accesses over 
fiber optics with high performance. However, the 
deployment of such networks, in which the copper of 
the access loop is totally or partially replaced by fiber, 
requires high levels of investment. In Spain, more than 
90% of the retail copper network has been switched off. 
Due to regulatory requirements, the remaining portion of 
the network is expected to be switched off by May 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, in Spain, fiber coverage 
reached 30.8 million premises. There is a growing 
demand for the services that these new networks can 
offer to the end customer. However, the high levels of 
investment required by these networks result in the 
need to continuously consider the expected return on 
investment. Telefónica is constantly looking for co-

investments through Telefónica Infra, but it may not be 
able to identify suitable partners.
In addition, the ability of the Telefónica Group's IT 
systems (operational and backup) to adequately support 
and evolve to respond to Telefónica's operating 
requirements is a key factor to consider in the 
commercial development, customer satisfaction and 
business efficiency of the Telefónica Group. While 
automation and other digital processes may lead to 
significant cost savings and efficiency gains, there are 
also significant risks associated with such transformation 
processes. Any failure by the Telefónica Group to 
develop or implement IT systems that adequately 
support and respond to the Group's evolving operating 
requirements could have an adverse effect on the 
Group's information, business, financial condition, results 
of operations and/or cash flows.
The changes outlined above force Telefónica to 
continuously invest in the development of new products, 
technology and services to continue to compete 
effectively with current or future competitors. Any such 
investment may reduce the Group’s profit and margins 
and may not lead to the development or 
commercialization of successful new products or 
services. To contextualize the Group’s total research and 
development effort, the total expenditure in  2024 was 
647 million euros (741 million euros in 2023), representing 
1.6% of the Group’s revenues (1.8% in 2023). These 
figures have been calculated using the guidelines 
established in the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (“OECD”) manual. 
Telefónica's investment in CapEx in 2024 was 5,475 
million euros (5,579 million euros in 2023).
If Telefónica is not able to anticipate and adapt to the 
technological changes and trends in the sector, or to 
properly select the investments to be made, this could 
negatively affect the Group's business, financial 
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
The Telefónica Group's strategy, which is 
focused on driving new digital businesses and 
providing data-based services, involves 
exposure to risks and uncertainties arising from 
data privacy regulation.
The Telefónica Group’s commercial portfolio includes 
products and/or services whose provision involves the 
processing of large amounts of information and data. 
This entails an enormous responsibility, while at the 
same time increasing the challenges related to 
compliance with strong and growing privacy and data 
protection regulations throughout the Telefónica 
Group's footprint, which may stifle the technological 
innovation that characterizes it and to which the Group 
is committed. Similarly, the Group's efforts to promote 
innovation may result in increased compliance risks and, 
where applicable, costs.
Telefónica is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the 
European Parliament and Council of April 2016, on the 
protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data and on the free movement 
of such data ("GDPR"), which is considered by the Group 
as a common standard of compliance in all its 
operations, even beyond the European Union. 
Additionally, the European Union has initiated a data 
legislative strategy that seeks to make the EU a leading 
space for the data-driven society, allowing data to flow 
freely throughout the territory and between different 
sectors. As a result, it is expected that new regulatory 
obligations will be imposed on operators.
In addition, since 2017 the European Union has been 
considering a proposal for a future European regulation 
concerning the respect for privacy and protection of 
personal data in electronic communications (“e-Privacy 
Regulation”), which would repeal Directive 2002/58/EC. 
If approved, the e-Privacy Regulation could establish 
additional and more restrictive rules than those 
established in the GDPR, with the consequent increase 
in the risks and costs that this could entail for Telefónica.
Discussions on the proposal for the e-Privacy Regulation 
have stalled, and the European Commission is studying 
different regulatory alternatives on the matter, which 
creates additional uncertainty with respect to the 
applicable regulatory framework going forward, which 
may negatively affect the development of new 
innovative products.
Moreover, considering that the Telefónica Group 
operates its business on a global scale, it frequently 
carries out international data transfers concerning its 
customers, users, suppliers, employees and other data 
subjects to countries outside the European Economic 
Area ("EEA") that have not been declared to have an 
adequate level of data protection by the European 
Commission, either directly or through third parties. In 
this context, it is particularly relevant to have the 
necessary legal and technical controls and mechanisms 
in place to ensure that such international data transfers 
are carried out in accordance with the GDPR, in an 
environment marked by uncertainty on this issue as to 
the most adequate and effective measures to mitigate 
such risks. 
With regard to the international transfer of data to the 
United States, on July 10, 2023, the European 
Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-
U.S. Data Privacy Framework. The adequacy decision 
concludes that the United States ensures an adequate 
level of protection for personal data transferred from the 
EU to U.S. companies participating in the EU-U.S. Data 
Privacy Framework. This adequacy decision remains

subject to challenge by privacy activists as was the case 
with previous decisions.
Telefónica is subject to data privacy regulations similar 
to the GDPR in the non-EU countries in which it 
operates, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Ecuador, 
Chile and Peru, increasing compliance risks and costs in 
these countries. For example, since its formal exit from 
the European Union ("Brexit”), the United Kingdom has 
implemented its own data protection framework, which 
largely mirrors the GDPR with certain tailored 
adjustments. Subsequent legislative efforts to simplify 
compliance for businesses in the United Kingdom (and, 
therefore, reduce data protections), while unsuccessful 
to date, have raised data privacy risks for EU companies 
who, like Telefónica, regularly engage with UK partners. 
Any such potential shifts in the applicable data privacy 
framework necessitate careful monitoring by Telefónica 
to mitigate compliance and cross-border data transfer 
risks. 
To limit the risks derived from international transfers of 
personal data among Telefónica Group companies, the 
Telefónica Group adopted Binding Corporate Rules 
(BCRs), approved by the Spanish Data Protection 
Authority on March 8, 2024, following a procedure of co-
operation between the European data protection 
authorities. However, there can be no assurance that 
such rules will be sufficient to ensure compliance with 
requirements in every jurisdiction in which the 
Telefónica Group operates. 
Data privacy protection requires careful design of 
products and services, as well as robust internal 
procedures and rules that can be adapted to regulatory 
changes where necessary, all of which entails 
compliance risk. Failure to maintain adequate data 
security and to comply with any relevant legal 
requirements could result in the imposition of significant 
penalties, damage to the Group’s reputation and the loss 
of trust of customers and users. 
Telefónica’s reputation depends to a large extent on the 
digital trust it is able to generate among its customers 
and other stakeholders. In this regard, in addition to any 
reputational consequences, in the European Union, very 
serious breaches of the GDPR may entail the imposition 
of administrative fines of up to the larger of 20 million 
euros or 4% of the infringing company’s overall total 
annual revenue for the previous financial year. 
Furthermore, if eventually approved, the e-Privacy 
Regulation or any similar alternative regulation may set 
forth sanctions for breaches of it similar to those 
provided for in the GDPR.
Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition, results of operations and/or 
cash flows of the Group.
Telefónica may not anticipate or adapt in a 
timely manner to changing customer demands 
and/or new ethical or social standards, which 
could adversely affect Telefónica's business 
and reputation. 
To maintain and improve its position in the market vis-à-
vis its competitors, it is vital that Telefónica: (i) 
anticipates and adapts to the evolving needs and 
demands of its customers, and (ii) avoids commercial or 
other actions or policies that may generate a negative 
perception of the Group or the products and services it 
offers, or that may have or be perceived to have a 
negative social impact. In addition to harming 
Telefónica's reputation, such actions could also result in 
fines and sanctions.
In order to respond to changing customer demands, 
Telefónica needs to adapt both (i) its communication 
networks and (ii) its offering of digital services. 
The networks, which had historically focused on voice 
transmission, have evolved into increasingly flexible, 
dynamic and secure data networks, replacing, for 
example, old copper telecommunications networks with 
newer technologies such as fiber, which facilitate the 
absorption of the exponential growth in the volume of 
data demanded by the Group's customers. 
In relation to digital services, customers require an 
increasingly digital and personalized experience, as well 
as a continuous evolution of the Group’s product and 
service offering. In this sense, relatively new services 
such as "Living Apps", “Connected Car”, “Smart Cities”, 
“Smart Agriculture”, “Smart Metering”, "Solar 360" and 
"Perplexity" (an Artificial Intelligence-driven answer 
engine service) which facilitate certain aspects of the 
Group’s customers’ digital lives, are being developed. 
Furthermore, new solutions for greater automation in 
commercial services and in the provision of the Group’s 
services are being developed, through new apps and 
online platforms that facilitate access to services and 
content, such as new video platforms that offer both 
traditional Pay TV, video on demand or multi-device 
access. In addition, Telefónica has launched new 
customer care applications (My Movistar in Spain, Me 
Vivo in Brazil, My O2 in the United Kingdom) and 
developed a virtual assistant, Aura, with the aim of 
increasing the accessibility of the products and services 
the Group offers. However, there can be no assurance 
that these and other efforts will be successful. 
In the development of all these initiatives it is also 
necessary to take into account several factors: firstly, 
there is a growing social and regulatory demand for 
companies to behave in a socially responsible manner, 
and, in addition, the Group’s customers are increasingly 
interacting through online communication channels, 
such as social networks, in which they express this 
demand. Telefónica's ability to attract and retain clients

depends on their perceptions regarding the Group’s 
reputation and behavior. The risks associated with 
potential damage to Telefónica's reputation have 
become more relevant, especially due to the impact that 
the publication of news through social networks can 
have.
If Telefónica is not able to anticipate or adapt to the 
evolving needs and demands of its customers or avoid 
inappropriate actions, its reputation could be adversely 
affected, or it could otherwise have an adverse effect on 
the business, financial condition, results of operations 
and/or cash flows of the Group.
Operational Risks. 
Information technology is key to the Group's 
business and is subject to cybersecurity risks. 
Telefónica's operations, as well as the products and 
services it provides, rely on information technology 
systems and platforms that are susceptible to 
cyberattacks. If successful, these attacks can hinder the 
effective provision, operation, and commercialization of 
our products and services and our customers’ use of the 
same. Therefore, cybersecurity risks are among the most 
significant risks for the Group. 
Telecommunications companies worldwide, including 
Telefónica, face a continuous increase in cybersecurity 
threats. These companies and their customers are 
becoming increasingly digital, processing and storing 
valuable information electronically relying on cloud 
services provided by third parties, permitting remote 
access and teleworking by employees and collaborators 
and expanding IoT environments. All of this complicates 
security management, forcing companies to review 
security controls beyond the traditional corporate 
network perimeter. At the same time, cyberattackers, 
including both state and independent actors, are 
becoming more sophisticated, armed with high levels of 
funding and advanced digital tools that use technologies 
such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
Threats include unauthorized access to systems, the 
installation of computer viruses or malicious software, 
and security breaches in the supply chain, with the aim 
of 
improperly 
obtaining 
sensitive 
information 
or 
disrupting the Group's operations, which may result in 
regulatory penalties. Furthermore, traditional security 
threats persist, such as the theft of laptops, data storage 
devices, and mobile phones, along with the possibility 
that Group employees or collaborators may leak 
information and/or perform acts that affect their 
networks or internal information. Additionally, the 
Telefónica Group is aware of potential cybersecurity 
risks arising from various international conflicts and 
monitors cyberattacks that may affect its infrastructure.
In the past three years, the Group has suffered various 
types of cybersecurity incidents that have included: 
intrusion attempts (direct or phishing), exploitation of 
vulnerabilities and corporate credentials being 
compromised; Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attacks, using massive volumes of Internet traffic that 
saturate the service; and malicious actions to carry out 
fraud in respect of services provided by Telefónica. In 
some of these incidents, personal data from our 
customers and employees has been stolen. To date, 
none of these cybersecurity incidents have had material 
consequences for the Telefónica Group, but this may 
change in the future.
The development and maintenance of systems to 
prevent and detect cyberattacks is costly and requires 
ongoing monitoring and updating to address the 
increasing sophistication of cyberattacks. In response to 
these risks, Telefónica has adopted technical and 
organizational measures as defined in its digital security 
strategy, such as the use of early vulnerabilities 
detection, access control, log review of critical systems 
and network segregation, as well as the deployment of 
firewalls, security controls in the supply chain, intrusion-
prevention systems, virus scanners incident response 
and recovery procedures, and backup systems. 
However, Telefónica can provide no assurance that such 
measures are sufficient to avoid or fully mitigate such 
incidents. The Telefónica Group has insurance policies 
in place intended to cover certain losses arising out of 
these types of incidents. However, due to the potential 
severity and uncertainty about the evolution of the 
aforementioned events, these policies may not be 
sufficient to cover in its entirety all losses that may arise 
out of a cybersecurity attack.
Climate change, natural disasters and other 
factors beyond the Group's control may result 
in physical damage to Telefónica's technical 
infrastructure that may cause unanticipated 
network or service interruptions or quality loss 
or otherwise affect the Group's business. 
Climate change, natural disasters and other factors 
beyond the Group's control, such as system failures, lack 
of electric supply, network failures, hardware or software 
failures or the theft of network elements, can damage 
Telefónica's infrastructure and affect the quality of, or 
cause interruption to, the provision of the services of the 
Telefónica Group. For example, in late October 2024, 
record-breaking flooding and related power outages in 
Valencia, Spain, resulting from a high-altitude, cut-off 
low-pressure storm system, caused severe damage to 
Telefónica's infrastructure. Fixed and mobile services 
were affected, and certain municipalities (104 at the 
worst moment) lost all communications. Repairs to the 
damaged infrastructure took up to 10 days. Telefónica's 
operations have also been affected by power outages in 
certain Latin American countries due to droughts and 
flooding.

Further, changes in temperature and precipitation 
patterns associated with climate change may increase 
the energy consumption of telecommunications 
networks or cause service disruption due to extreme 
temperature waves, floods or extreme weather events. 
These changes may cause increases in the price of 
electricity due to, for example, reduction in hydraulic 
generation as a result of recurrent droughts. Further, as 
a result of global commitments to tackle climate change, 
new carbon dioxide taxes may be imposed and could 
affect, directly or indirectly, Telefónica Group, and may 
have a negative impact on the Group’s operations and 
results. Telefónica analyses these risks in accordance 
with the guidelines set forth in the Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), and with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 
Network or service interruptions or quality loss or 
climate-related risks could cause customer 
dissatisfaction, a reduction in revenues and traffic, the 
realization of expensive repairs, the imposition of 
sanctions or other measures by regulatory bodies, and 
damage to the image and reputation of the Telefónica 
Group, or could otherwise have an adverse effect on the 
business, financial condition, results of operations and/or 
cash flows of the Group.
Financial Risks. 
Worsening of the economic and political 
environment could negatively affect 
Telefónica's business.  
Telefónica’s international presence enables the 
diversification of its activities across countries and 
regions, but it exposes Telefónica to diverse legislation, 
as well as to the political and economic environments of 
the countries in which it operates. Any adverse 
developments in these countries, such as economic 
uncertainty, inflationary pressures, rapid normalization of 
monetary policy, exchange rate or sovereign-risk 
fluctuations, as well as growing geopolitical tensions, 
may adversely affect Telefónica’s business, financial 
position, debt management, cash flows and results of 
operations and/or the performance of some or all of the 
Group’s financial indicators. 
In recent years, successive shocks have ushered in a 
period characterized by extraordinary uncertainty and 
the simultaneous occurrence of multiple negative 
disruptions. Inflationary pressures arising from 
bottlenecks associated with the rapid post-pandemic 
recovery, coupled with increases in commodity prices, 
led to a robust response from central banks (raising 
interest rates and withdrawing liquidity from the system) 
and a significant loss of purchasing power for 
consumers. Additionally, the recent higher wage 
demands observed internationally, reflecting both the 
strength of labour markets, especially those in major 
developed economies, and the prevalence (though to a 
lesser extent than in the past) of wage indexation 
mechanisms, have also contributed to these inflationary 
pressures.
Although inflationary pressures eased in 2024, there are 
recent signs that progress is stalling in some countries 
where the Group operates, or even reversing course as 
in Brazil. Price pressures and relatively high interest rates 
persist in many countries. Geopolitical events such as 
the Russia-Ukraine war, armed conflict and political 
instability in the Middle East and the possible imposition 
of tariffs by major economies pose risks to inflation 
dynamics, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, 
there is a risk that the decrease in global liquidity and 
higher-for-longer interest rates could generate 
increased financial volatility, giving rise to new stress 
episodes, especially if inflation proves to be more 
persistent than expected. Additionally, premature 
monetary easing by central banks could lead to 
resurgent inflation, potentially triggering a new 
stagflation period akin to the 1970s.
Looking forward, elements that could worsen the effects 
of the current situation include the escalation of armed 
conflicts and potential disruptions to energy and goods 
supply, as well as possible additional increases in 
commodity prices. This could result in a potential de-
anchoring of inflation expectations and higher-than-
expected wage hikes, prolonging and amplifying the 
inflation-recession scenario. As a consequence of the 
above, economic growth is expected to remain weak in 
the short term, with the risk of recession still present in 
some parts of the world.
So far, the main European countries where the Group 
operates have been affected by the ongoing geopolitical 
conflicts mainly through the price channel (higher 
commodity prices, intermediate inputs and salary costs, 
among others), as their direct trade and financial 
exposure is limited. However, there continues to be a 
concern in Europe  about energy dependence in the 
face of potential episodes of gas shortages and 
lengthening energy transition. Latin America could be 
affected by lower external demand associated with 
slower global growth, deteriorating terms of trade, 
tighter financial conditions and doubts about debt 
sustainability.   
As of December 31, 2024, the contribution of each 
segment to the Telefónica Group's total assets was as 
follows: Telefónica Spain 25.7% (26.0% as of December 
31, 2023), VMO2 7.6% (7.5% as of December 31, 2023), 
Telefónica Germany 17.7% (17.8% as of December 31, 
2023), Telefónica Brazil 22.2% (25.0% as of December 31, 
2023) and Telefónica Hispam 14.1% (14.4% as of 
December 31, 2023). Part of the Group's assets are 
located in countries that do not have an investment

grade credit rating (in order of importance, Brazil, 
Argentina (sold in February 2025), Ecuador and 
Venezuela). Likewise, Venezuela and Argentina are 
considered countries with hyperinflationary economies 
in 2024 and 2023.
During 2024, the contribution of each segment to the 
Telefónica Group's revenues was as follows (does not 
include VMO2 that is recorded by the equity method 
and therefore does not contribute to the consolidated 
revenues): Telefónica Spain 31.0% (31.1% in 2023), 
Telefónica Germany 20.6% (21.2% in 2023), Telefónica 
Brazil 23.3% (23.7% in 2023) and Telefónica Hispam 
21.9% (20.6% in 2023).
The main risks by geography are detailed below: 
In Europe, there are several economic and political risks. 
Firstly, the evolution of armed conflicts poses a threat to 
growth and inflation prospects. Any worsening in the 
supply of gas, oil, food, or other goods due to disruptions 
in the supply chain would negatively impact their prices, 
with a consequent effect on the disposable income of 
both households and businesses. In the medium term, 
this could result in wage increases, a persistent rise in 
inflation, and tighter monetary policy. Any of the above 
could have a negative impact on the cost of financing for 
the private sector, including Telefónica, and could 
trigger episodes of financial stress.
In addition, there is also a risk of financial fragmentation 
in the eurozone, meaning that interest rates may react 
differently in different countries within the eurozone, 
leading to differences in yields on bonds issued by more 
indebted countries (including Spain) and those issued by 
less indebted countries, making it challenging for the 
former to access credit at low rates. 
Lastly, Europe faces three significant long-term risks. 
First, Europe may fall behind in the global technological 
race in particular because of both its dependence on 
several critical raw materials, indispensable for key 
sectors, that must be imported from other regions, and 
its lag in technological innovation. Second, a 
burdensome regulatory environment in the European 
Union poses a significant threat to business, impeding 
growth and eroding competitiveness, with companies 
based in countries and regions where regulations are 
relatively less complex, extensive or restrictive. Third, 
demographic factors such as declining birth rates and 
population aging may have a negative impact on the 
region's labor force and long-term growth prospects.
Regarding political risk, centrist political groups 
maintained a majority following the 2024 European 
Parliament elections but nationalist and populist parties 
made significant gains. It remains to be seen whether 
greater fragmentation in the parliament will hinder 
governance and the continuity of the ongoing agenda in 
fiscal and economic matters, climate and energy policy 
as well as other aspects of regional governance.
• Spain: there are several local sources of risks. One of 
them stems from the risk that high commodity prices 
and/or the emergence of wage pressures could 
prolong the inflationary episode with a deeper impact 
on household income. Secondly, further delays in the 
disbursement of Next Generation European Funds 
(NGEU) could limit their final impact on GDP growth 
and employment. In addition, as one of the most open 
countries in the world from a commercial point of view, 
being among the top ten countries in respect of 
capital outflows and inflows globally, Spain could be 
negatively impacted by the rise of protectionism and 
trade restrictions. Lastly, the impact of higher-for-
longer interest rates could be a source of financial 
stress due to high public indebtedness and lead to a 
possible correction in the real estate market. In the 
long term, the challenge is to increase the growth of 
potential GDP through improvements in productivity 
and investment and ensure the sustainability of public 
debt.
• Germany: the risk of energy shortages has diminished 
recently due to Europe's response in terms of 
diversification of energy sources and the rapid 
construction of regasification plants in the country. 
However, it is possible that problems with energy 
supply may arise again. Alternative sources for gas 
imports could be limited, consumption could be higher 
due, for example, to an unusually cold winter, or 
competition for gas from other countries could 
increase. On the other hand, there is concern that 
higher-than-expected wage growth and/or higher 
input costs could lead to more persistent inflation 
diminishing competitiveness among the 
manufacturing sector. As for the medium to long term, 
there is a risk that prolonged or escalating geopolitical 
tensions could reduce international trade or increase 
competition to German-made products with a 
consequent impact on the country’s potential growth, 
which is dependent on exports. Additionally, following 
the German federal election, it is relevant that a stable 
majority is formed capable of addressing the major 
challenges facing the country, especially in terms of 
investment needs. Finally, long-term challenges 
remain, such as the ageing of the population.
• United Kingdom: more persistent inflation could weigh 
on consumption and further depress economic 
growth. In particular, there is a concern that currently 
dynamic wage growth could lead to a further increase 
in the prices of goods and services, preventing 
inflation rates from totally normalizing. On the other 
hand, although the UK economy has few direct trade 
links with Russia and Ukraine, it is vulnerable to 
developments in the global energy market as it is the 
second European economy with the largest share of

gas in the energy mix. Finally, the formal exit of the 
United Kingdom from the European Union on 
December 31, 2020 (Brexit) has created new barriers 
to trade in goods and services, mobility and cross-
border exchanges, which will continue to entail an 
economic adjustment in the medium term. 
In Latin America, the exchange rate risk is currently 
considered moderate by the Telefónica Group, except in 
Venezuela, but may increase in the future. The end of 
electoral events and rapid central bank actions to 
contain inflation may, at least partially, limit the impact of 
external risks (global trade tensions, abrupt movements 
in commodity prices, concerns about global growth, 
tightening U.S. monetary policy and financial imbalances 
in China) and internal risks (managing the monetary 
normalization and the possible fiscal deterioration) but 
there is no assurance that this will be the case.
• Brazil: fiscal sustainability and increased economic 
intervention remain the main domestic risk. Despite 
recently announced measures to curb public 
spending, tax reforms aimed at simplifying the indirect 
tax system and promoting stronger and sustainable 
economic growth and an upward revision of Brazil's 
credit rating outlook by Moody's, volatility surrounding 
fiscal sustainability has increased. Moreover, inflation 
expectations have continued to deteriorate following 
the poor performance of the Brazilian real in a context 
of fiscal volatility, paving the way for further interest 
rate hikes and increasing the risks of a more 
pronounced economic slowdown.  
• Chile, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador: these countries 
are exposed not only to changes in the global 
economy, given their vulnerability and exposure to 
changes in commodity prices, but also to tightening of 
global financial conditions. On the domestic side, 
existing political instability and the possibility of further 
social unrest and the resurgence of populism could 
have a negative impact in both the short and medium 
term. In this regard, measures that result in excessive 
growth in public spending that jeopardize fiscal 
balance could have a negative impact on sovereign 
credit ratings, further deteriorating local financing 
conditions. If inflation is more persistent than 
expected, this could limit central banks' ability to 
respond to an abrupt drop in activity levels and could 
also increase the risk of financial instability. Political 
uncertainty has decreased in Chile, following the 
rejection of a proposed new Constitution in December 
2023, but the maintenance of the former status quo 
could give rise to new social demands. A presidential 
election is due to take place in November 2025 (and a 
runoff election may follow in December 2025). In 
Colombia, the structural reforms promoted by 
Colombia's government are expected to be more 
market friendly due to the weakening of the 
government coalition. In Peru, the government 
succeeded in reducing the social protests against the 
installation of the current administration, although it 
remains politically weak. In Ecuador, presidential and 
legislative elections were held in February 2025. The 
election took place against a backdrop of 
unprecedented social and economic challenges, as 
well as armed conflicts between the government and 
several organized crime groups. A run-off presidential 
election will be held in April 2025. 
As discussed above, the countries where the Group 
operates are generally facing significant economic 
uncertainties and, in some cases, political uncertainties. 
The worsening of the economic and political 
environment in any of the countries where Telefónica 
operates may materially adversely affect the Group’s 
business, financial condition, results of operations and/or 
cash flows.
The Group has experienced and, in the future, 
could experience impairment of goodwill, 
investments accounted for by the equity 
method, deferred tax assets or other assets. 
In accordance with current accounting standards, the 
Telefónica Group reviews on an annual basis, or more 
frequently when the circumstances require it, the need 
to introduce changes to the book value of its goodwill 
(which as of December 31, 2024, represented 16.4% of 
the Group’s total assets), deferred tax assets (which as 
of December 31, 2024, represented 6.6% of the Group’s 
total assets) or other assets, such as intangible assets 
(which represented 9.8% of the Group's total assets as of 
December 31, 2024), and property, plant and equipment 
(which represented 21.3% of the Group's total assets as 
of December 31, 2024).  In the case of goodwill, the 
potential loss of value is determined by the analysis of 
the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (or 
group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill is 
allocated at the time it is originated, and such calculation 
requires significant assumptions and judgment. In 2024, 
Telefónica recorded impairment losses on intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment in Argentina in 
an aggregate amount of 1,274 million euros and 
impairment losses on goodwill in an aggregate amount 
of 866 million euros with respect to the cash-generating 
units in Chile (397 million euros), Peru (226 million euros), 
Telefónica Tech UK & Ireland (192 million euros) and BE-
terna Group (51 million euros). Likewise, impairment 
losses were recorded in Peru in 2024, including 
impairment losses on intangible assets (54 million euros) 
and on goodwill allocated to the fiber optics business (34 
million euros), as well as a reversal of deferred tax assets 
for loss carryforwards (91 million euros).  Additionally, 
following the analysis of the recoverability of the assets 
of Pangea (the wholesale fiber optic company in Peru) at 
the end of 2024, an impairment of property, plant and 
equipment amounting to 108 million euros has been 
recorded, as well as a reversal of deferred tax assets 
amounting to 13 million euros (see Notes 2, 6, 7, 8, 25 and 
30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2023, 
impairment losses in the goodwill of Telefónica Ecuador

were recognized for a total of 58 million euros. In 
addition, VMO2, Telefónica's 50:50 joint venture with 
Liberty Global in the United Kingdom, recorded in 2023 
an impairment of goodwill amounting to 3,572 million 
euros, with a negative impact of 1,786 million euros on 
the share of (loss) income of investments accounted for 
by the equity method in the consolidated income 
statement of the Group in 2023.  
In addition, Telefónica may not be able to realize 
deferred tax assets on its statement of financial position 
to offset future taxable income. The recoverability of 
deferred tax assets depends on the Group’s ability to 
generate taxable income over the period for which the 
deferred tax assets remain deductible. If Telefónica 
believes it is unable to utilize its deferred tax assets 
during the applicable period, it may be required to 
record an impairment against them resulting in a non-
cash charge on the income statement. 
Further impairments of goodwill, deferred tax assets or 
other assets may occur in the future which may 
materially adversely affect the Group’s business, 
financial condition, results of operations and/or cash 
flows.
The Group faces risks relating to its levels of 
financial indebtedness, the Group's ability to 
finance itself, and its ability to carry out its 
business plan. 
The operation, expansion and improvement of the 
Telefónica Group's networks, the development and 
distribution of the Telefónica Group's services and 
products, the implementation of Telefónica's strategic 
plan and the development of new technologies, the 
renewal of licenses and the expansion of the Telefónica 
Group's business in countries where it operates, may 
require a substantial amount of financing. 
The Telefónica Group is a relevant and frequent issuer of 
debt in the capital markets. As of December 31, 2024, the 
Group's gross financial debt amounted to 38,782 million 
euros (37,061 million euros as of December 31, 2023), 
and the Group's net financial debt amounted to 27,161 
million euros (27,349 million euros as of December 31, 
2023). As of December 31, 2024, the average maturity of 
the debt was 11.3 years (11.6 years as of December 31, 
2023), including undrawn committed credit facilities. 
A decrease in the liquidity of Telefónica, or a difficulty in 
refinancing maturing debt or raising new funds as debt 
or equity could force Telefónica to use resources 
allocated to investments or other commitments to pay 
its financial debt, which could have a negative effect on 
the Group's business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows.
Funding could be more difficult and costly to obtain in 
the event of a deterioration of conditions in the 
international or local financial markets due, for example, 
to monetary policies set by central banks, including 
increases in interest rates and/or decreases in the 
supply of credit, increasing global political and 
commercial uncertainty and oil price instability, or if 
there is an eventual deterioration in the reputation, 
solvency or operating performance of Telefónica.
As of December 31, 2024, the Group's gross financial 
debt scheduled to mature in the following 12 months 
amounted to 5,590 million euros and the gross financial 
debt scheduled to mature in 2026 amounted 2,607 
million euros. 
In accordance with its liquidity policy, Telefónica has 
covered its gross debt maturities for the next 12 months 
with cash and credit lines available as of December 31, 
2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Telefónica Group 
had undrawn committed credit facilities arranged with 
banks for an amount of 11,017 million euros (10,634 million 
euros of which were due to expire in more than 12 
months). Liquidity could be affected if market conditions 
make it difficult to renew undrawn credit lines. As of 
December 31, 2024, 3.5% of the aggregate undrawn 
amount under credit lines was scheduled to expire prior 
to December 31, 2025. 
In addition, given the interrelation between economic 
growth and financial stability, the materialization of any 
of the economic, political and exchange rate risks 
referred to above could adversely impact the availability 
and cost of Telefónica's financing and its liquidity 
strategy. This in turn could have a negative effect on the 
Group's business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows.
Finally, any downgrade in the Group’s credit ratings may 
lead to an increase in the Group's borrowing costs and 
could also limit its ability to access credit markets.
The Group's financial condition and results of 
operations may be adversely affected if it does 
not effectively manage its exposure to interest 
rates or foreign currency exchange rates. 
Interest rate risk arises primarily in connection with 
changes in interest rates affecting: (i) financial expenses 
on floating-rate debt (or short-term debt likely to be 
renewed); (ii) the value of long-term liabilities at fixed 
interest rates; and (iii) financial expenses and principal 
payments of inflation-linked financial instruments, 
considering interest rate risk as the impact of changes in 
inflation rates. 
In nominal terms, as of December 31, 2024, 83% of the 
Group's net financial debt had its interest rate set at 
fixed interest rates for periods of more than one year. 
The effective cost of debt related interest payments for 
the last 12 months excluding leases was 3.32% as of 
December 31, 2024 compared to 3.80% as of December

31, 2023. To illustrate the sensitivity of financial expenses 
to variations in short-term interest rates as of December 
31, 2024: (i) a 100 basis points increase in interest rates in 
all currencies in which Telefónica had a financial position 
at that date would have led to an increase in financial 
expenses of 41 million euros, whereas (ii) a 100 basis 
points decrease in interest rates in all currencies (even if 
negative rates are reached) would have led to a 
reduction in financial expenses of 41 million euros. For 
the preparation of these calculations, a constant position 
equivalent to the position at that date is assumed of net 
financial debt.
Exchange rate risk arises primarily from: (i) Telefónica’s 
international presence, through its investments and 
businesses in countries that use currencies other than 
the euro (primarily in Latin America and the United 
Kingdom); (ii) debt denominated in currencies other than 
that of the country where the business is conducted or 
the home country of the company incurring such debt; 
and (iii) trade receivables or payables in a foreign 
currency to the currency of the company with which the 
transaction was registered. According to the Group's 
calculations, the impact on results, and specifically on 
net exchange differences, due to a 10% depreciation of 
Latin American currencies against the U.S. dollar and a 
10% depreciation of the rest of the currencies to which 
the Group is most exposed against the euro would result 
in exchange gains of 42 million euros as of December 31, 
2024 and a 10% appreciation of Latin American 
currencies against the U.S. dollar and a 10% appreciation 
of the rest of the currencies to which the Group is most 
exposed, would result in exchange losses of 42 million 
euros as of December 31, 2024. These calculations have 
been made assuming a constant currency position with 
an impact on profit or loss as of December 31, 2024 
taking into account derivative instruments in place. 
In 2024, the evolution of exchange rates (without 
considering the effects of hyperinflationary countries) 
had a negative impact in the year-on-year growth of the 
Group's consolidated revenues and EBITDA, subtracting 
2.2 percentage points and 2.9 percentage points 
respectively (in 2023 it had a positive impact of 0.2 
percentage points on year-on-year revenue growth and 
no impact at the EBITDA level). Furthermore, translation 
differences in 2024 had a negative impact on the 
Group's equity of 959 million euros (positive impact of 37 
million euros in 2023).  
The Telefónica Group uses a variety of strategies to 
manage this risk including, among others, the use of 
financial derivatives, which are also exposed to risk, 
including counterparty risk. The Group's risk 
management strategies may be ineffective, which could 
adversely affect the Group's business, financial 
condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. If the 
Group does not effectively manage its exposure to 
foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates, it may 
adversely affect its business, financial condition, results 
of operations and/or cash flows.
Legal and Compliance Risks. 
Telefónica and Telefónica Group companies are 
party to lawsuits, antitrust, tax claims and other 
legal proceedings. 
Telefónica and Telefónica Group companies operate in 
highly regulated sectors and are and may in the future 
be party to lawsuits, tax claims, antitrust and other legal 
proceedings in the ordinary course of their businesses, 
the outcome of which is unpredictable. 
The Telefónica Group is subject to regular reviews, tests 
and audits by tax authorities regarding taxes in the 
jurisdictions in which it operates and is a party and may 
be a party to certain judicial tax proceedings. In 
particular, the Telefónica Group is currently party to 
certain tax and regulatory proceedings in Brazil, primarily 
relating to the ICMS (a Brazilian tax on 
telecommunication services) and the corporate tax. 
Telefónica Brazil maintained provisions for tax 
contingencies amounting to 314 million euros and 
provisions for regulatory contingencies amounting to 179 
million euros as of December 31, 2024. In addition, 
Telefónica Brazil faces possible tax and regulatory 
contingencies for which no provisions are made (see 
Note 24.c. "Provisions—Other Provisions—Telefónica 
Brazil" and Note 25 "Tax matters—Tax Litigation in 
Telefónica Brazil" to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements).
(see Note 24c. Other Provisions and Note 25-Tax 
Litigation in Telefónica Brazil, to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements). The Group makes estimates for 
its tax liabilities that the Group considers reasonable, but 
if a tax authority disagrees, the Group could face 
additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. 
There can be no guarantee that any payments related to 
such contingencies or in excess of Telefónica's 
estimates will not have a significant adverse effect on 
the Group’s business, results of operations, financial 
condition and/or cash flows. In addition to the most 
significant litigation indicated above, further details on 
these matters are provided in Notes 25 (Tax matters) 
and 29 (Other information) to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The details of the provisions for litigation, 
tax sanctions and claims can be found in Note 24 
Provisions of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Telefónica Group is also party to certain litigation in Peru 
concerning certain previous years' income taxes in 
respect of which Telefónica has been notified that the 
judicial resolutions which resolve the contentious 
administrative processes are unfavorable to the Group 
and will require it to pay taxes related to prior years. At 
the end of the relevant proceedings, the Tax

Administration, through an administrative act, has not 
yet finally determined the amount of the payment 
obligation. The total provision as of December 31, 2024 
amounted to2,739 million Peruvian soles (approximately 
700million euros at the exchange rate at such date).                              
An adverse outcome or settlement in these or other 
proceedings, present or future, could result in significant 
costs and may have a material adverse effect on the 
Group's business, financial condition, results of 
operations and/or cash flows.
Increased scrutiny and changing expectations 
from stakeholders, evolving reporting and other 
legal obligations and compliance with the 
Telefónica Group's own goals regarding ESG 
matters, may expose the Telefónica Group to 
various risks.
The Telefónica Group may be unable to adapt to or 
comply with increasingly demanding expectations from 
analysts, investors, customers and other stakeholders 
and new regulatory reporting or other legal 
requirements related to ESG issues. Further, 
expectations and requirements may differ from region to 
region, may be based on diverging calculation or other 
criteria and may experience material changes as they 
still are at their emerging phase.
Further, the Telefónica Group's disclosure of information 
on its ESG objectives and initiatives in its public reports 
and other communications (including its CO2 emission 
reduction targets) exposes it to the risk that it will fail to 
achieve these objectives and initiatives. 
Although the Telefónica Group is working to comply 
with new ESG reporting requirements, to achieve its 
objectives, and to meet the expectations of its 
stakeholders in these matters, if the Company is unable 
to meet these expectations, fails to adequately address 
ESG matters or fails to achieve the reported objectives 
(including its CO2 emission reduction targets), the 
Telefónica Group’s reputation, its business, financial 
position, results of operations and/or cash flows could 
be materially and adversely affected.
The Telefónica Group is exposed to risks in 
relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws 
and regulations and economic sanctions 
programs. 
The Telefónica Group is required to comply with the 
anti-corruption laws and regulations of the jurisdictions 
where it conducts operations around the world, 
including in certain circumstances with laws and 
regulations having extraterritorial effect such as the U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the "FCPA") and 
the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010. The anti-
corruption laws generally prohibit, among other conduct, 
providing anything of value to government officials for 
the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or 
securing any improper business advantage or failing to 
keep accurate books and records and properly account 
for transactions. 
In this sense, due to the nature of its activities, the 
Telefónica Group is increasingly exposed to this risk, 
which increases the likelihood of occurrence. In 
particular, it is worth noting the continuous interaction 
with officials and public administrations in several areas, 
including the institutional and regulatory fronts (as the 
Telefónica Group carries out a regulated activity in 
different jurisdictions), the operational front (in the 
deployment of its network, the Telefónica Group is 
subject to obtaining multiple activity permits) and the 
commercial front (the Telefónica Group provides 
services directly and indirectly to public administrations). 
Moreover, Telefónica is a multinational group subject to 
the authority of different regulators and compliance with 
various regulations, which may be domestic or 
extraterritorial in scope, civil or criminal, and which may 
lead to overlapping authority in certain cases. Therefore, 
it is very difficult to quantify the possible impact of any 
breach, bearing in mind that such quantification must 
consider not only the economic amount of sanctions, but 
also the potential negative impact on the business, 
reputation and/or brand, or the ability to contract with 
public administrations.
Additionally, the Telefónica Group’s operations may be 
subject to, or otherwise affected by, economic sanctions 
programs and other forms of trade restrictions 
(“sanctions”) including those administered by the United 
Nations, the European Union, the United States, 
including by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of 
Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the United Kingdom. 
Sanctions restrict the Group’s business dealings with 
certain countries, territories, individuals and entities and 
may impose certain trade restrictions, among others, 
export and/or import trade restrictions to certain goods 
and services. In this context, the provision of goods and 
services by a multinational telecommunications group, 
such as the Telefónica Group, directly and indirectly, and 
in multiple countries, requires the application of a high 
degree of diligence to prevent the contravention of 
sanctions. Given the nature of its activity, the Telefónica 
Group’s exposure to these sanctions is particularly 
noteworthy.    
Although the Group has internal policies and procedures 
designed to ensure compliance with the above 
mentioned applicable anti-corruption laws and 
sanctions regulations, there can be no assurance that 
such policies and procedures will be sufficient or that 
the Group's employees, directors, officers, partners, 
agents and service providers will not take actions in 
violation of the Group's policies and procedures (or, 
otherwise in violation of the relevant anti-corruption 
laws and sanctions regulations) for which the Group, its 
subsidiaries or they may be ultimately held responsible.

In this regard, Telefónica cooperates with governmental 
authorities in connection with the enforcement of anti-
corruption laws. For example, certain companies within 
the Group have been the subject of corruption 
investigations and charges in the past, one of which 
recently resulted in a financial penalty. See Note 29 b)-
Other Proceedings to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.  
Failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and 
sanctions regulations could lead to further financial 
penalties, termination of government contracts, and the 
revocation of licenses and authorizations, and could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group's 
reputation, or otherwise adversely affect the Group's 
business, financial condition, results of operations and/or 
cash flows.

4.1. Main aspects of 
Corporate Governance in 2024 and 
2025 
4.1.1. Corporate Governance 
System
Telefónica’s basic corporate governance system 
principles are set forth in its Bylaws, in the 
Regulations of its Board of Directors, in the 
Regulations for the General Shareholders’ Meeting, 
in the Regulations for the Audit and Control 
Committee, in the Regulations for the  Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee, in the Internal Code of Conduct for 
Securities Markets Issues,  and in certain Policies 
relating to this matter; particularly noteworthy, 
among others, are the Diversity Policy in relation to 
the Board of Directors and the Selection of Board 
Members, the Disclosure, Contact and Engagement 
Policy for Shareholders, Institutional Investors and 
Proxy Advisors, the Remuneration Policy of the 
Directors of Telefónica, S.A. and the Responsible 
Business Policy. These regulations determine the 
action principles of the Board of Directors, govern its 
organization and operation and set the rules of 
conduct of its members.  
The principles underlying Telefónica’s corporate 
governance system are the following:  
a. the maximization of the value of the Company in 
the interest of the stakeholders,  
b. the essential role of the Board of Directors in the 
supervision of the management of the Company, 
and  
c. transparency as regards information in relations 
with its stakeholders including employees, 
shareholders, investors and customers, among 
others.  
In this regard, the Board of Directors will take the 
necessary measures to ensure: (i) that the Company’s 
management team pursues the creation of value for 
the shareholders, (ii) that such management team is 
under its actual supervision, (iii) that no person or 
small group of persons holds a decision-making 
power that is not subject to checks and balances or 
controls, and (iv) that any shareholder receives 
privileged treatment compared to the others.  
4.1.2. Continuous improvement of 
Corporate Governance   
Telefónica undertakes the firm commitment to 
continuously improve its corporate governance 
framework by expanding, enhancing and 
consolidating best practices in this subject.
To this end, the Company carries out an ongoing 
analysis and review of its corporate governance 
structures and the degree of compliance with the 
main recommendations existing in the subject of 
good governance, always in consideration of possible 
initiatives to make short and medium term 
improvements and seeking out the formula for 
governance that best defends the interests of its 
shareholders and sustainable value creation. 
In this context, Telefónica has adopted, among 
others, the following decisions and measures: 
i) the implementation of the new recommendations 
of Technical Guide 1/2024 on Public Interest Audit 
Committees and the appointment by the Board of 
Directors of a verifier of the Company's Sustainability 
Information, in anticipation of the Draft Law on 
Corporate Information on Sustainability;
ii) the progressive renewal of the Board of Directors 
through the appointment of new Directors who 
possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and 
professional background to contribute to the success 
of the Telefónica Group's project in the coming years 
and to face the challenges that will arise in the 
telecommunications sector, as well as the 
reorganization of various positions within the Board 
of Directors, including the appointment of Mr. Marc

iv) the update of part of the regulations and internal 
policies of the Company in those matters where it 
has been required. 
The detail of the matters indicated in the above 
paragraphs is given below:
> New Technical Guide 1/2024 on Public 
Interest Audit Committees
In the 2024 financial year, significant corporate 
governance improvements have been adopted in the 
areas of auditing and sustainability. In particular, the 
Company has taken into consideration the new 
recommendations included in Technical Guide 
1/2024 on Public Interest Audit Committees, 
prepared by the National Securities Market 
Commission. Among other improvements, this has 
led to the review of the content of the annual report 
on the activities of the Audit and Control Committee 
for the 2024 fiscal year. Furthermore, in the area of 
sustainability, the Board of Directors, anticipating the 
Draft Law on Corporate Information on Sustainability, 
which is currently in the parliamentary process (and 
will amend the Commercial Code, the Capital 
Companies Act, and the Audit Act, and which 
transposes into Spanish law Directive (EU) 
2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council of December 14, 2022, amending Regulation 
(EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 
2006/43/EC, and Directive 2013/34/EU) as regards 
corporate sustainability reporting, resolved on 
December 11, 2024 the appointment of the verifier of 
the Company's Sustainability Information for the said 
fiscal year.
> Changes related to the composition of the 
Board of Directors and its Committees 
Following the vacancy on the Board of Directors due 
to the voluntary resignation of Independent Director 
Ms. Carmen García de Andrés, for personal reasons 
and to facilitate the renewal of the Company's 
governing body, the Board of Directors, following the 
favorable report of the Nominating, Compensation 
and Corporate Governance Committee, approved on 
May 8, 2024 the appointment of Mr. Carlos Ocaña 
Orbis as new Proprietary Director, at the request of 
the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales 
(SEPI). 
Additionally, in light of the Company's new 
shareholder structure and the expressed preference 
of some relevant shareholders to initiate a new phase 
in the executive chairmanship, on January 18, 2025, 
the Board of Directors of Telefónica, following the 
favorable report of the Nominating, Compensation 
and Corporate Governance Committee, agreed to: (i) 
the orderly renewal of the Company's chairmanship 
to align it with its new shareholder structure; and (ii) 
the appointment of Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra Millar as 
the Company's Executive Director, also appointing 
him as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors 
and delegating all delegable powers to him, replacing 
the former Executive Chairman, Mr. José María 
Álvarez-Pallete López, who resigned at that same 
meeting.
Furthermore, the CNMV Technical Guide 1/2019 on 
nomination and remuneration committees 
recommends that in companies with a lead 
independent director, this person should be a 
member of the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee or, alternatively, 
that this Committee maintains regular contact with 
him. In this regard, on January 29, 2025, the Board of 
Directors, with the abstention of the Executive 
Directors and at the proposal of the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee, agreed to appoint as Lead Independent 
Director to the Independent Director, Mr. Peter 
Löscher (Chairman of the Nominating, Compensation 
and Corporate Governance Committee), replacing 
Mr. José Javier Echenique Landiríbar.
Additionally, on January 29, 2025, the Audit and 
Control Committee, replacing Mr. José Javier 
Echenique Landiríbar, agreed to appoint Independent 
Director Ms. María Luisa García Blanco as 
Chairwoman of the said Committee. This 
appointment not only reinforces the Company's 
commitment to gender diversity but also underscores

subsidiaries-, at any time and as many times as it 
deems appropriate, of its own fully-paid in shares 
through purchase and sale, exchange or any other 
legal transaction. 
The minimum acquisition price or minimum value 
consideration shall be equal to the par value of the 
shares of its own stock acquired, and the maximum 
acquisition price or maximum value consideration 
shall be equal to the listing price of the shares of its 
own stock acquired by the Company on an official 
secondary market at the time of the acquisition. 
Such authorization is granted for a period of 5 years 
as from the date of this General Shareholders’ 
Meeting and is expressly subject to the limitation that

any of its subsidiaries shall at no time exceed the 
maximum amount permitted by the Law at any time, 
and the limitations on the acquisition of the 
Company’s own shares established by the regulatory 
Authorities of the markets on which the shares of 
Telefónica, S.A. are traded shall also be observed.

It is expressly stated for the record that the 
authorization granted to acquire shares of its own 
stock may be used in whole or in part to acquire 
shares of Telefónica, S.A. that it must deliver or 
transfer to directors or employees of the Company or 
of companies of its Group, directly or as a result of 
the exercise by them of their option rights, all within

systems referencing the listing price of the 
Company’s shares. 
B) To authorize the Board of Directors, as broadly as 
possible, to exercise the authorization granted by this 
resolution and to implement the other provisions 
contained therein; such powers may be delegated by 
the Board of Directors to the Executive Commission, 
the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, 
the Chief Operating Officer or any other person 
expressly authorized by the Board of Directors for 
such purpose.  
C) To deprive of effect, to the extent of the unused 
amount, the authorization granted under Item V on

Authorisation to increase share capital  
As regards the authorizations conferred in respect of the 
share capital, and in addition to the authorization already 
described to acquire the Company’s own shares, the 
shareholders acting at the Ordinary General 
Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 12, 2020 resolved to 
delegate to the Board of Directors, as broadly as 
required by Law, pursuant to the provisions of Section 
297.1.b) of the Companies Act, the power to increase the 
share capital on one or more occasions and at any time, 
within a period of five year from the date of adoption of 
such resolution, by the maximum nominal amount of 
2,596,065,843 euros, equal to one-half of the share 
capital of the Company on the date of adoption of the 
resolution at the General Shareholders’ Meeting, issuing 
and floating the respective new shares for such purpose 
with or without a premium, the consideration for which 
will consist of monetary contributions, with express 
provision for incomplete subscription of the shares to be 
issued. The Board of Directors was also authorized to 
exclude pre-emptive rights in whole or in part, as 
provided in section 506 of the Companies Act. However, 
the power to exclude pre-emptive rights is limited to 
20% of the share capital on the date on which the 
resolution is adopted. In accordance with the above-
mentioned authorization, as of the end of fiscal year 
2024, the Board would be authorized to increase the 
share capital by the maximum nominal amount of 
2,596,065,843 euros. 
Furthermore, the shareholders at the Ordinary General 
Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica, S.A., held on June 
12, 2020, delegated to the Board of Directors, in 
accordance with the general rules governing the 
issuance of debentures and pursuant to the provisions of 
applicable law and the Company’s Bylaws, the power to 
issue debentures, bonds, notes and other fixed-income 
securities and hybrid instruments, including preferred 
shares, which may in all cases be simple, exchangeable 
and/or convertible and/or grant the holders thereof a 
share in the earnings of the Company, as well as 
warrants, with the power to exclude the pre-emptive 
rights of shareholders. The aforementioned securities 
may be issued on one or more occasions, within a 
maximum period of five years as from the date of 
adoption of the resolution. However, the power to 
exclude pre-emptive rights is limited to 20% of the share 
capital on the date on which the resolution is adopted. 
The securities issued may be debentures, bonds, notes 
and other fixed-income securities, or debt instruments of 
a similar nature, or hybrid instruments in any of the forms 
admitted by Law (including, among others, preferred 
interests) both simple and, in the case of debentures, 
bonds and hybrid instruments, convertible into shares of 
the Company and/or exchangeable for shares of the 
Company, of any of the companies of its Group or of any 
other company and/or giving the holders thereof an 
interest in the corporate earnings. Such delegation also 
includes warrants or other similar instruments that may 
entitle the holders thereof, directly or indirectly, to 
subscribe for or acquire newly-issued or outstanding 
shares, payable by physical delivery or through 
differences. The aggregate amount of the issuance or 
issuances of instruments that may be approved in 
reliance on this delegation may not exceed, at any time, 
25,000 million euros or the equivalent thereof in another 
currency. In the case of notes and for purposes of the 
above-mentioned limits, the outstanding balance of 
those issued in reliance on the delegation shall be 
computed. In the case of warrants, and also for the 
purpose of such limit, the sum of the premiums and 
exercise prices of each issuance shall be taken into 
account.  
Furthermore, under the aforementioned delegation 
resolution, the shareholders at the Ordinary General 
Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica, S.A. resolved to 
authorize the Board of Directors to guarantee, in the 
name of the Company, the issuance of the 
aforementioned instruments issued by the Companies 
belonging to its Group of Companies, within a maximum 
period of five years as from the date of adoption of the 
resolution. 
Restrictions on the transferability of securities 
and/or voting rights

26 of the Company’s Bylaws, no shareholder may 
exercise a number of votes exceeding 10 percent of the 
total share capital with voting rights existing at any time, 
regardless of the number of shares held, all of the 
foregoing with full and mandatory submission to the 
provisions of the Law. In determining the maximum 
number of votes that each shareholder may cast, only 
the shares held by the shareholder in question shall be 
computed, not including those held by other holders 
who have delegated their representation to that 
shareholder, without prejudice to the application of the 
same percentage limit of 10 percent to each of the 
shareholders represented individually. 
The limitation established in the preceding paragraph 
shall also apply to the maximum number of votes that 
may be cast -either jointly or separately- by two or more 
shareholder companies belonging to the same group of 
entities, as well as to the maximum number of votes that 
may be cast by an individual or legal entity that is a 
shareholder, and the entity or entities, also shareholders, 
that the former directly or indirectly controls. 
For the purposes indicated in the preceding paragraph, 
in order to consider the existence of a group of entities, 
as well as the control situations indicated above, the 
provisions of section 18 of the Companies Act shall 
apply. 
Establishing in the Bylaws the maximum number of 
votes that may be cast by the same shareholder or by 
shareholders belonging to the same group (article 26 of 
the Bylaws) is warranted because the purpose of such 
measure is to establish an appropriate balance and to 
protect the position of minority shareholders, preventing 
a possible concentration of votes on a small number of 
shareholders, which could affect the furtherance of the 
corporate interest or the interest of all the shareholders 
as a guide for the actions of the shareholders at the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting. Telefónica believes that 
this measure does not constitute a mechanism to block 
public tender offers but rather a guarantee that the 
acquisition of control will require sufficient consensus 
among all the shareholders since, as is natural and may 
be seen from experience, potential offerors may 
condition their offer to the removal of such requirement. 
In addition, and in accordance with section 527 of the 
Companies Act, at listed companies, bylaw provisions 
that directly or indirectly establish, in general terms, the 
maximum number of votes that may be cast by a single 
shareholder, companies belonging to the same group or 
those acting in concert with the foregoing shall cease to 
have effect when, following a public tender offer, the 
offeror has reached a percentage equal to or greater 
than 70 percent of the capital carrying voting rights, 
unless such offeror is not subject to equivalent 
neutralization measures or has not adopted them. 
On the other hand, the shareholders at a General 
Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica, S.A. have not 
resolved to adopt any neutralization measure in the 
event of a public tender offer in reliance on the 
provisions of the Securities Market Act. 
In addition, the provisions of Article 7 of Law 19/2003 of 
July 4, 2003 on the legal regime governing the 
movement of capital and economic transactions abroad 
and on certain measures to prevent money laundering 
and Article 18 of Royal Decree 571/2023 of July 4, 2003 
on foreign investment, which require prior authorisation 
for foreign investments in Spain in activities directly 
related to national defence, are applicable. This 
authorisation is exempted in two cases: (a) acquisitions 
of less than 5% of the share capital provided that they do 
not allow participation in the administrative body and (b) 
acquisitions of between 5% and 10% of the share capital 
provided that the investor renounces in a public deed 
before the Administration not to exercise or transfer to 
third parties its voting rights and not to form part of any 
corporate administrative bodies.
Likewise, the provisions of Article 7.bis.1 of the 
aforementioned Law 19/2003 must be taken into 
account, which requires prior authorisation for foreign 
investment involving the acquisition of a stake equal to 
or greater than 10% of the share capital (or any that 
entails the acquisition of total or partial control) when it 
affects strategic sectors such as: critical 
telecommunications infrastructure, data processing or 
storage, critical and dual-use telecommunications 
technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics, 
cybersecurity, sectors with access to sensitive 
information, etc. Article 7.bis.3 of this Law requires prior 
authorisation for foreign investments with the same 
percentage or effect on the control of the company 
when, among other cases, the foreign investor is directly 
or indirectly controlled by the government of a third 
country.
In both cases, investment transactions carried out 
without the required prior authorisation are not valid and 
have no legal effect until they are legalised, so that, until 
the necessary authorisation is obtained, the foreign 
investor cannot exercise his economic or political rights.
4.2.2. Significant Shareholders  
According to the information existing at the Company, 
there is no individual or legal entity that directly or 
indirectly, individually or jointly with others, exercises or 
may exercise control over Telefónica on the terms set 
out in section 5 of the Securities Market Act. 
As of the date of drawing up of this Report, there are, 
however, certain shareholders holding interests that 
may be considered significant within the meaning of 
Royal Decree 1362/2007, of October 19, and which are 
the following:

4.3. General Shareholders' 
Meeting
4.3.1. Shareholders’ Rights  
The Bylaws of Telefónica, S.A. provide for a single class 
of shares (common shares), giving all the holders thereof 
identical rights. There are no non-voting shares or 
shares, or a loyalty vote, carrying more than one vote or 
with privileges in the distribution of dividends, or 
reinforced quorum or qualified majorities other than 
those established by law. 
There is no provision for the shareholders at a General 
Shareholders´ Meeting having to approve decisions 
entailing an acquisition, disposition or the contribution to 
another company of essential assets or similar corporate 
transactions other than those established by law. 
This section describes some of the main rights of the 
shareholders of the Company. 
Right to receive information 
The General Shareholders’ Meeting is called as much in 
advance as required by law, through a notice published 
in, at a minimum: (i) the Official Gazette of the 
Commercial Registry or one of the widest circulation 
dailies in Spain; (ii) the website of the National Securities 
Market Commission; and (iii) the Company’s corporate 
website. 
The notice published on the Company’s corporate 
website remains accessible on a continuous basis at 
least until the holding of the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting. Likewise, the Board of Directors may publish 
notices in other media, if it deems appropriate, in order 
to ensure public and effective dissemination of the call 
to meeting. 
From the date of publication of the notice of the call to 
the General Shareholders’ Meeting, the Company makes 
available to its shareholders the documents and 
information that must be provided to them in 
accordance with legal or bylaw-mandated requirements 
in connection with the various items included on the 
Agenda; such items and documents are posted on the 
Company’s website from the above-mentioned date. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders may obtain 
such documents and information immediately and free 
of charge at the Company’s registered office, and 
request that they be delivered or mailed to them free of 
charge, in the cases and on the terms established by 
law. 
In addition, from the date of publication of the call to the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting and until the fifth day 
prior to the date set for the holding of the meeting on 
first call, any shareholder may request in writing such 
information or clarifications or ask such questions in 
writing as it deems relevant concerning the matters 
included on the Agenda of the call to meeting, or 
concerning the information accessible to the public that 
the Company may have provided to the National 
Securities Market Commission since the holding of the 
immediately preceding General Shareholders’ Meeting, 
or concerning the auditor’s report. 
The Board of Directors will be required to provide in 
writing, until the day of the holding of the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting, the requested information or 
explanations, as well as to reply, also in writing, to the 
questions asked. The replies to the questions and to the 
requests for information will be sent through the 
Secretary of the Board of Directors by any of the 
members of the Board or by any person expressly 
authorized by the Board of Directors for such purpose. 
During the holding of the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting, shareholders may request such information or 
explanations as they deem appropriate concerning the 
matters included on the Agenda or with respect to the 
information accessible to the public provided by the 
Company to the National Securities Market Commission 
since the holding of the last General Shareholders’ 
Meeting or concerning the auditor’s report. In the event 
that it is impossible to satisfy the shareholder’s right at 
that time, the Board of Directors will be required to 
provide such information in writing within seven days of 
the end of the General Shareholders’ Meeting. 
The Board of Directors will be required to provide the 
requested information as described in the two preceding 
paragraphs in the manner and within the periods 
established by law, except in those cases where: (i) such 
information is unnecessary for the protection of the 
shareholder’s rights or there are objective reasons to 
consider that it could be used other than for corporate 
purposes, or the dissemination thereof would harm the 
Company or its related companies; (ii) the request for 
information or explanations does not relate to matters

included on the Agenda or, in the case of paragraph two 
of this subsection (Right to Receive Information), to 
information accessible to the public that was provided 
by the Company to the National Securities Market 
Commission since the holding of the last General 
Shareholders’ Meeting; and (iii) it is so established in 
statutory or regulatory provisions. The exception 
described in subsection (i) above shall not apply if the 
information was requested by shareholders representing 
at least one-fourth of the share capital. 
The replies to shareholders attending the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting from a distance electronically 
and simultaneously and exercising their right to receive 
information through such procedure shall be provided, 
where applicable, during the meeting itself, or in writing, 
within seven days following the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting. 
Supplement to the call to the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting and right to submit new 
proposal for resolutions
Shareholders representing at least three percent of the 
share capital may request that a supplement to the call 
to the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting be 
published, including one or more items on the Agenda, 
provided the new items are accompanied by a rationale 
or, if appropriate, by a duly substantiated proposed 
resolution. In addition, and on the terms set forth in 
section 519 of the Companies Act (Ley de Sociedades de 
Capital), shareholders representing at least three 
percent of the share capital may, within five days 
following publication of the notice of the call to meeting, 
submit duly substantiated proposed resolutions on 
matters already included or that must be included on the 
Agenda. Such rights shall be exercised by means of duly 
authenticated notice, which must be received by the 
Company in accordance with the provisions of the Law. 
Right to attend and to appoint a proxy 
Shareholders holding at least 300 shares registered in 
their name in the respective book-entry register five 
days prior to the General Shareholders’ Meeting and 
providing evidence thereof through the respective 
attendance card or certificate issued by the Company or 
by any of the Depositary Entities Members of Sociedad 
de Gestión de los Sistemas de Registro, Compensación 
y Liquidación de Valores, S.A.U. (IBERCLEAR) or in any 
other form allowed by applicable legislation may attend 
the General Shareholders’ Meeting called. 
Any shareholder having the right to attend may be 
represented at the General Shareholders’ Meeting by 
another person, even if such person is not a shareholder. 
Proxies may be granted through the proxy forms printed 
on the attendance cards or in any other manner allowed 
by law, without prejudice to the provisions of the 
Companies Act regarding cases of representation by 
family members and the grant of general powers of 
attorney. The documents granting the proxy for the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting shall include instructions 
concerning the direction of the vote. Unless the 
shareholder granting the proxy expressly states 
otherwise, it shall be deemed that such shareholder 
issues precise voting instructions in favor of the 
proposed resolutions submitted by the Board of 
Directors on the matters included on the Agenda. If 
there are no voting instructions because the 
shareholders acting at the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting could decide on matters that, while not 
included on the Agenda and therefore not known on the 
date on which the proxy is granted, might be put to a 
vote at the General Shareholders’ Meeting, the proxy 
shall cast the vote in the direction the proxy considers 
best, taking into account the interest of the Company 
and that of the shareholder the proxy represents. The 
same provisions shall apply when the respective 
proposal or proposals submitted to a decision of the 
shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting were 
not made by the Board of Directors. 
It is expressly stated for the record that the notice of call 
of the last Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting 
expressly provided that unless the shareholder granting 
the proxy expressly stated otherwise, such shareholder 
would be deemed to issue precise instructions to vote 
against the respective resolution on any matter that, 
while not included on the Agenda and therefore not 
known on the date on which the proxy was granted, 
might be put to a vote at the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting. 
If the proxy document does not state the specific person 
to whom the shareholder grants his proxy, it shall be 
deemed to have been granted to the Chair of the Board 
of Directors of the Company or to the person who may 
replace him as Chair of the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting. If the appointed proxy should be in a situation 
of conflict of interest regarding the vote on any of the 
proposals which, whether or not included on the 
Agenda, are submitted at the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting and the shareholder granting the proxy has not 
issued precise voting instructions, the proxy shall be 
deemed to have been granted to the Secretary for the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting. 
Shareholders who are not holders of the minimum 
number of shares required to attend may also grant a 
proxy in writing with respect to such shares to a 
shareholder with the right to attend or form a group with 
other shareholders in the same situation until they have 
the necessary number of shares, and grant a proxy in 
writing to one of them.

Right to vote and adoption of resolutions 
Every share present in person or by proxy at the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting shall entitle the holder thereof to 
one vote. 
Resolutions shall be adopted by simple majority, 
meaning that proposed resolutions will be approved 
when the number of votes in favor of each proposal is 
greater than the number of votes against it (regardless 
of the number of blank votes and abstentions), without 
prejudice to the reinforced voting quorums established 
in the law and in the Bylaws. 
Rules for amending the Company’s Bylaws 
The Bylaws and Regulations for the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting of Telefónica confer upon the 
shareholders acting at a General Shareholders’ Meeting 
the power to approve the amendment of the Bylaws 
(articles 15 and 5, respectively), subject to applicable 
legal provisions for all other matters. 
The procedure for amending the Bylaws is established in 
sections 285 and seq. of the Companies Act, and must 
be approved at the General Shareholders’ Meeting 
complying with the quorum and majorities required in 
sections 194 and 201 of the same law. In particular, if the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting is summoned to 
deliberate on Bylaw amendments, including capital 
increases or reductions, bond issuance, on eliminating or 
restricting pre-emptive rights in respect of new shares 
and on the transformation, merger, spin-off or the global 
assignment of assets and liabilities and the relocation of 
the registered office abroad, then shareholders that own 
at least fifty percent of the subscribed capital with voting 
rights will have to be present or be represented by proxy 
on first call. If there is no sufficient quorum, the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting will be held on second call, in 
which case at least twenty-five percent of the 
subscribed capital with voting rights will need to be 
present, either in person or by proxy. When shareholders 
that represent less than fifty percent of the subscribed 
capital with voting rights are present at the Meeting, 
either in person or by proxy, the resolutions referred to 
above may only be approved when two-thirds of the 
capital, present or represented by proxy at the Meeting, 
vote in favor of the resolution.   
Pursuant to section 286 of the Companies Act, if the 
Bylaws are amended, the Directors or, if appropriate, the 
shareholders who made the proposal must draw up in 
full the text of their proposed amendment and a written 
report justifying the amendment, which must be made 
available to the shareholders when the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting is called to deliberate on the 
amendment. 
Furthermore, and pursuant to section 287 of the 
Companies Act, the notice calling the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting must clearly state the items that 
might be amended, and note that all the shareholders 
are entitled to analyze the full text of the proposed 
amendment and the report on such amendment at the 
registered offices, as well as to request such documents 
to be delivered or sent to them free of charge. 
Pursuant to section 291 of the Companies Act, when 
new obligations are established for the shareholders due 
to an amendment of the Bylaws, the resolution must be 
passed with the approval of the affected shareholders. 
Furthermore, if the amendment directly or indirectly 
affects a type of shares, or part of them, the provisions of 
section 293 of such Act shall apply. 
The procedure for voting on proposed resolutions at the 
General Shareholders’ Meeting is regulated in section 
197 bis of the Companies Act and in the internal 
regulations of Telefónica (in particular, article 23 of the 
Regulations for the General Shareholders’ Meeting). This 
article states, among other things, that when 
amendments are made to the Bylaws, each article or 
group of articles which is materially different will be 
voted on separately. 
Corporate Website 
Telefónica complies with applicable legislation and best 
practices in terms of the content of its website 
concerning Corporate Governance. In this respect, it 
fulfills both the technical requirements for access to and 
content of the Company website, including information 
on General Shareholders’ Meetings, through direct 
access from the homepage of Telefónica, S.A. in the 
“Shareholders and Investors” section, which includes not 
only all of the information that is legally required but also 
information that the Company considers to be of 
interest. 
4.3.2. Dialogue with the 
Shareholders  
The Regulations for the General Shareholders’ Meeting 
and the Regulations of the Board of Directors of 
Telefónica, S.A. devote several of their sections to 
governing the channels whereby relations between the 
Board of Directors and the shareholders of the Company 
(both individual shareholders and institutional 
shareholders and investors) are established in order to 
thereby ensure the greatest possible transparency in 
such relations. It is further expressly provided that the 
Board of Directors undertakes to guarantee equal 
treatment in its relations with the shareholders. The 
purpose of the Company’s actions in this area, based on 
the paramount standard of transparency, is the 
distribution of all public information generated by the 
Company, making it accessible to all its shareholders 
simultaneously and in a non-discriminatory manner, 
complying with their need for information and ensuring

that published information satisfies the standards of 
quality, clarity and truthfulness.  
In addition, and within this context, the Board of 
Directors of the Company, at its meeting held on 
November 25, 2015, approved the Policy on Information, 
Communication and Contacts with Shareholders, 
Institutional Investors and Proxy Advisors, the second 
and third edition of which was also approved by the 
Board at its meetings of November 4, 2019 and 
December 16, 2020, respectively, to include new 
developments and the latest trends on the matter. In the 
latest edition of December 16, 2020, the name of said 
Policy was changed to Disclosure, Contact and 
Engagement Policy of Telefónica, S.A. for shareholders, 
institutional investors and proxy advisors.
In connection therewith, and as provided in such Policy, 
the Board of Directors of Telefónica is the body 
responsible for establishing and supervising appropriate 
mechanisms of communication and relationship with 
shareholders, institutional investors and proxy advisors 
that fully respect the rules prohibiting market abuse and 
that provide similar treatment to shareholders in the 
same position. 
Thus, the Board of Directors, acting through its 
corresponding decision-making bodies, endeavors to 
defend, protect and facilitate the exercise of the rights of 
shareholders, institutional investors and the markets in 
general and, in particular, their right to information, 
within the framework of protecting the corporate 
interest, which is understood as the achievement of a 
profitable and sustainable business over the long-term, 
which fosters its continuity and the maximization of the 
economic value of the company, all in accordance with 
the following principles: 
a)Transparency and truthfulness, immediacy, equality 
and symmetry in the diffusion of economic/financial, 
non-financial and corporate information by 
dissemination thereof through the reporting and 
communication channels provided in this Policy, which 
contribute to maximizing the dissemination and quality 
of information available to the market, to investors and 
to other stakeholders.
b)Published information shall be clearly written and must 
be true, complete in all material respects and comply 
with all applicable legal requirements, such that it 
reasonably provides a true and fair view of the financial 
and nonfinancial position, the profits/losses and the 
business of the Company in all material respects.
c)Information shall be subjected to an internal control 
system of a Coordination and Control Committee, and 
to supervision by the Internal Audit directorate, the 
Audit and Control Committee, the Board of Directors 
and the External Auditor. 
d)Encouraging the engagement within the Company of 
shareholders and institutional investors, particularly by 
providing access to information relevant to the 
exercise by shareholders of their rights, mainly the 
rights to attend and vote at the General Meeting. 
e)Development of information disclosure tools that take 
advantage of new technology in order to communicate 
rapidly and effectively using economical means.
f) Compliance with applicable law, particularly the 
Market Abuse Regulation, and the internal rules of the 
Company, especially the Internal Code of Conduct for 
Securities Markets Issues.
Telefónica disseminates to the market and 
communicates to its shareholders and institutional 
investors and to its other stakeholder groups, its 
information through various channels: 
▪

international official bodies.

under applicable law is classified as inside or relevant, 
periodic financial and non-financial information, and

Likewise, the Company delivers each and every one of 
the communications that it has filed for these purposes 
with the CNMV to other foreign supervisory authorities 
and bodies in all markets on which its shares are 
admitted to listing. Information sent to the CNMV is 
immediately disseminated on the CNMV's website and is 
subsequently published on the Company's website.
Within this context, Telefónica mainly publishes the 
following financial, non-financial and corporate 
information: i) Communications of Inside Information  
and Other Relevant Information; ii) Quarterly results 
information; iii) Semi-annual results information; iv) 
Annual Information (Annual Financial Statements and

Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States).

▪
General Shareholders’ Meeting
As already mentioned in preceding paragraphs, the 
Board of Directors encourages informed and responsible 
participation by the shareholders at the General 
Shareholders` Meeting, and adopts such measures and 
guarantees as may be appropriate to ensure that the 
shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting 
effectively perform their duties under the law and the 
Company’s corporate governance principles. 
In addition, from the call to the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting, the shareholders can access the Office of the 
Shareholder, in order to resolve questions that might be 
raised and respond to and inform those persons who 
wish to take the floor. 
The Office of the General Secretary of the Company, 
with the support of the Investor Relations, People and 
Sustainability Area, is responsible for maintaining 
ongoing contact and dialogue with proxy advisors, 
answering their questions regarding proposed 
resolutions submitted at the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting and providing the clarifications they deem to be 
required, so that their voting recommendations can be 
based on a real understanding of the Company and its 
situation. 
Likewise, Telefónica must also monitor the policies and 
recommendations of such proxy advisors, as well as 
international developments and trends in corporate 
governance, and evaluate the recommendations and 
principles issued by proxy advisers in relation to 
corporate governance standards, taking into account 
the particular circumstances of the Company and its 
environment and, in any event, the legal provisions that 
may apply to the Company. 
▪

coordinate the communication of the different 
subsidiaries with the market in order to ensure that it is 
appropriate, consistent and coherent at all times.

and Telefónica's management team, in a face-to-face 
format, hybrid or virtual. 
During 2024, contact was maintained with 
approximately 500 institutional investors, attending 27 
roadshows and sectoral or general conferences 
organised by investment banks, both face-to-face and 
virtual.
Attendance at forums and conferences in the 
telecommunications sector or generally in Europe/Latin 
America and in Environmental, Social and Governance 
matters (ESG), is also a natural channel for Telefónica’s 
communication with institutional investors. Thus, during 
2024, Telefónica has been present at 19 sectoral or 
general conferences organized by banks.
There are also presentations to and meetings with 
analysts and institutional investors that delve into 
strategic issues of the Company, which supplement the 
published information and may be necessary or 
appropriate to facilitate communication and the long-
term creation of value. 
Within this context and for some years now, Telefónica 
has an Engagement Program with the Company’s main 
investors, informing them transparently and on an 
ongoing basis of, among other things, business strategy, 
financial performance, corporate governance 
(composition of the Board of Directors and Good 
Governance practices), remuneration and sustainability. 
In addition to Investor Relations, other areas of the 
Telefónica Group responsible for matters concerning 
which queries are received, such as the Office of the 
General Secretary, People or Sustainability, also 
participate in this program. The Company is committed 
to the main investors in ESG, and regularly makes 
telephone calls, roadshows and holds face-to-face 
meetings in London, Paris and USA, or in virtual format. 
All these measures are used to coordinate and manage 
communication with the market in order to ensure that it 
is appropriate, consistent and coherent at all times.
 
Communication with institutional investors, analysts and 
shareholders may not take place during the periods prior 
to publication of the results of the Group or of 
subsidiaries that are subject to securities market rules. 
b) Office of the Shareholder 
Telefónica's Shareholders' Office ensures transparent, 
agile and fluid communication with its shareholders, 
providing the same information in due time and form as 
it does to institutional shareholders.
The Company provides all of them with a 
communication service consisting of sending emails

information and other relevant information 
communications, news, quarterly results (videos, 
infographics, etc.), monthly newsletters, Acción 
Telefónica magazine, podcasts, blogs, stock market 
information, among others, in order to promote 
transparency and communication between the 
Company and its shareholders. This information is sent 
to shareholders who request this service and is available 
for consultation and/or download in the "Shareholders' 
Area" section of the corporate website.
The quarterly magazine "Acción Telefónica" includes 
financial, operational and sustainability information, as 
well as a summary of financial results, news reports and 
exclusive campaigns for shareholders that can be

events, sponsorships, acknowledgements, blogs, 
podcasts, etc., is also distributed to shareholders 
registered with the communications service.

register to enjoy more than 400 offers on various 
products and services from different well-known brands. 
These offers range from travel to education and culture, 
as well as health and sports, among others.
There is also a current affairs section that includes the 
most listened podcasts and the most interesting current 
affairs blogs, both published by the Company.
During 2024, the offer of free training courses for 
shareholders on the most important subjects of the 
moment has been maintained, allowing them to improve 
their knowledge of the digital and financial world and 
access to cultural and sporting events sponsored by the 
Company.
In addition, the Shareholders' Office holds regular 
meetings with shareholders in the various Spanish 
provinces with the largest number of shareholders, 
informing them of the Company's strategy and the latest 
results published, thus offering personalised treatment 
to shareholders and complying with the transparency 
requirements to offer the same information to individual 
and institutional shareholders. These meetings establish 
a two-way communication between the Company and 
its shareholders, where points of view can be 
exchanged. During 2024, 2 face-to-face meetings have 
been held at the Barcelona and Bilbao Stock Exchanges, 
analysing the results and the company's strategic plan 
for the coming years. Likewise, 2 virtual meetings have 
been held with shareholders that are hosted on the

maintained, via telephone, electronic, postal and virtual, 
with the shareholder, especially on the occasion of the 
presentation of results and the main communications of 
inside or relevant information, such as distribution of 
dividends, calls for General Meetings of Shareholders, 
corporate operations, etc. 
On the other hand, in order to improve the dialogue 
between the Company and its shareholders, Information 
Assemblies may be held periodically in which the 
shareholders participate, under the terms established, to 
discuss and address current issues of the Telefónica 
Group and that are considered of special attractiveness 
and interest to this group. These questions may concern 
regulatory developments in the field of listed companies, 
aspects related to the progress of the business or other 
matters.

the channels of communication with shareholders are 
expanded to facilitate their participation therein. The 
Office of the Shareholder can be contacted directly 
through a form within a specific microsite for the 
Meeting. Shareholders can use this medium to ask 
questions relating to items on the agenda, the delivery of 
documentation relating thereto, and the procedure for 
participating in the General Shareholders’ Meeting, 
either in person or by proxy, with a section of frequently 
asked questions and a virtual assistant to facilitate 
information and an explanatory video of participation in 
the Meeting, as well as information on the

dividend policy, results, corporate transactions, among 
other things.

Distrito Telefonica, Edificio Central Pl. 2ª Ronda de la 
Comunicación s/n Madrid 20850, Spain. 
• Specific section for shareholders ("Shareholders’

Furthermore, throughout the year, the Office of the 
Shareholder collects and manages the suggestions and 
requests of the shareholders regarding other areas of 
the Telefónica Group, such as customer service, billing, 
sales, etc. and is thus a means for bringing the Company 
closer to the shareholders.  
The engagement activities carried out in the year are 
indicated below:
▪
4 virtual and face-to-face meetings and about 
200 telematic communications (quarterly magazine, 
monthly newsletter, Shareholders' Meeting 
communications, relevant information of cultural and 
informative interest for shareholders and call centre).
▪
More than 17,000 shareholders contacted.
▪
Social Media.
Telefónica's social media profiles: Linkedin, X (Twitter), 
YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Tik Tok, have 
become a channel for the communication of corporate, 
business, event and conference information.
In addition, and subject to securities market regulations 
on the communication of inside information, the 
Company may use social media to simultaneously 
communicate inside information as an additional or 
complementary channel to the CNMV, provided that the 
Company complies with the requirements of applicable 
legal provisions on the communication of inside 
information and other relevant information and with the 
other internal rules of the Company.
▪
Mass Media. 
Based on the circumstances, and every time, the 
Company considers the suitability of summoning the 
media for the presentation of its annual results, with the 
participation, when appropriate, of Telefónica’s 
management team, in order to inform the media 
regarding the progress of the Company and its projects, 
always subject to the principles of non-disclosure of 
inside information and other relevant information that 
has not already been published and the equal treatment 
of shareholders.

Structure of the Board of Directors (size, 
composition, diversity, procedure for selecting 
Directors)
Size
As of December 31, 2024, and as of the date of drawing up 
of this Report, the Board of Directors was and is composed 
of 14 members.
Additionally, it should be noted that the Company's Board 
of Directors has four Committees (the Executive 
Committee and three Advisory Committees), which 
ensures the active participation of its Directors.

• Executive Directors: 2/14
• Independent Directors: 8/14
The Independent Directors represent 57,1% of the 
Board of Directors, which gives a high degree of 
compliance with corporate governance 
recommendations, which require that the management 
body consist of a large majority of external Directors 
and that the number of independent Directors 
represent at least one-half of the total number of 
Directors. It should be noted that these 
recommendations have been expressly incorporated in 
the Regulations of the Board of Directors of the 
Company, as amended on December 16, 2020. 
• Proprietary Directors: 3/14
• Other External Directors: 1/14
Diversity
Telefónica S.A. has a Director Selection Policy as of 
November 25, 2015. This Policy was updated i) on 
December 13, 2017 to include the Diversity Policy 
applicable to the Board of Directors and, consequently, 
was renamed the Diversity Policy in relation to the 
Telefónica, S.A. Board of Directors and the Selection of 
Directors, and ii) on December 16, 2020, in order to adapt 
this Policy to the applicable regulations and, specifically, to 
the recommendations of the Good Governance Code of 
the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), 
which was partially reformed in June 2020.
This Policy ensures that the procedures for selecting 
Directors are based on a prior analysis of the of the skills 
required by the Board of Directors, and favors thereof 
diversity of knowledge, training and professional 
experience, age, disability and gender on the Board, free 
from any implicit bias that might imply any form of 
discrimination, particularly on account of gender, disability 
or any other personal condition, and that facilitate the 
selection of female Directors in a number that allows the 
achievement of an equal balance of women and men.
In accordance with the provisions of said Policy, the 
selection of candidates to serve as a Director at Telefónica 
adheres to the following principles:
1. An effort is made to ensure that the Board of Directors 
has a balanced composition, with a large majority of non-
Executive Directors and an appropriate mix of Proprietary 
and Independent Directors, while also endeavoring to 
ensure that Independent Directors have sufficient weight 
within the Board of Directors.
In particular, and on the occasion of the appointment by 
co-option of Mr. Carlos Ocaña Orbis (candidate proposed 
by the significant shareholder Sociedad Estatal de 
Participaciones Industriales (SEPI)) as Proprietary Director 
of the Company on May 8, 2024, following a favorable 
report from the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee, an effort has been made to 
achieve a balanced composition of the Board of Directors. 
This appointment reflects the permeability of the share 
capital and the significant shareholders of Telefónica, as 
well as the current shareholding structure of the 
Company.
2. The Board of Directors endeavors to ensure that the 
procedures for the selection of Directors favor diversity of 
knowledge, training, professional experience, age and 
gender, and are free from any implicit biases that might 
imply any form of discrimination. All of the foregoing is in 
order for the Board of Directors to have an appropriate, 
diverse and balanced composition overall, which i) 
enriches analysis and debate, ii) contributes multiple 
viewpoints and positions, iii) favors decision-making taking 
into account the nature and complexity of the business, as 
well as the social and environmental context, iv) gives it 
maximum independence, and v) allows for compliance 
with legal requirements and good governance 
recommendations in relation to composition and suitability 
required to be met by the members of the various internal 
oversight Committees of the Board of Directors.

In particular, the Company's Board of Directors promotes 
the aim of inclusion of female Directors, as well as 
measures that promote the Company having a significant 
number of female senior executive officers based on good 
governance recommendations, all without prejudice to the 
key principles of merit and ability that must govern all of 
the Company’s staff selection processes.
The Board of Directors regularly evaluates the degree of 
compliance and effectiveness of this Policy and, in 
particular, the percentage of female directors at any given 
time. 
3. The process for the selection of candidates to serve as 
Directors is also based on a prior analysis of the skills 
required by the Board of Directors. Such analysis is 
conducted by the Company’s Board of Directors, with the 
advice and with the required report or proposal, if 
applicable, of the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee. 
In this regard, on January 18, 2025, the Company's Board 
of Directors, following a favorable report from the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee, agreed to the orderly renewal of the 
Company's Chairmanship to adapt it to its new 
shareholding structure. Therefore, it approved the 
appointment by co-option of Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra 
Millar as Executive Director of the Company, following a 
prior analysis of the competencies required by the Board 
of Directors. His profile and professional career are 
detailed in the section related to the "Professional 
background of the members of the Board of Directors."
4. In the case of re-election or ratification, the report or 
proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee contains an evaluation of the 
work and effective dedication to the position for the most 
recent period of time during which the proposed Director 
has been in that position, as well as the Director’s ability to 
continue to perform satisfactorily. 
5. The required report or proposal of the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee is 
published upon the call to the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting at which the ratification, appointment or re-
election of each Director is submitted. 
Furthermore, the Board of Directors and the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee 
ensure, within the scope of their respective powers, that 
the candidates chosen for the position of Director are 
persons of recognized probity, competence and 
experience, who are willing to devote the time and effort 
required for the performance of their duties, exercising 
rigorous care in the selection of the persons called upon to 
serve as Independent Directors. 
Accordingly, all the candidates for the position of Director 
shall be professionals of integrity, whose conduct and

On the other hand, and with regard to gender diversity, 
following the voluntary resignation of Ms. Carmen García 
de Andrés as Independent Director, for personal reasons 
and to facilitate the renewal of the Company's governing 
body, the percentage of female Directors relative to the 
total number of Board members is currently 35.71%. In this 
regard, the Company continues to work towards 
incorporating women who meet the required professional 
profile to increase gender diversity on the Board of 
Directors, achieving a balanced presence of women and 
men, and to avoid selection procedures suffering from 
implicit biases that hinder the appointment of female 
Directors and to comply with the best international 
corporate governance practices in terms of equality.
Likewise, in 2018 the Company’s Board of Directors, at the 
proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate

It should also be noted that the same criteria and 
principles that the Company applies to the process of 
selecting and appointing the members of the Board of 
Directors are applied to the appointment of the Directors 
who are part of the various Committees of the Company’s 
Board of Directors, as well as, with regard to gender 
diversity, the appointment of female senior executive, all 
without prejudice to the key principles of merit and ability 
that must govern all of the Company’s staff selection 
processes. 
In this regard, on January 29, 2025, the Audit and Control 
Committee of Telefónica, S.A. agreed to appoint the 
Independent Director, Ms. María Luisa García Blanco, as 
Chairwoman of said Committee.
Lastly, with regard to performance evaluation, the Board of 
Directors conducts an annual evaluation of its operation 
and of that of its Committees, assessing in particular the 
application, in terms of the composition and competencies 
of the Board of Directors, of the various aspects of 
diversity included in the aforementioned Policy, as well as 
the performance of the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors, of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and of 
the various Directors, paying special attention to the 
heads of the various Board Committees and adopting 
appropriate measures for their improvement. This 
assessment is carried out every 3  years with the 
assistance of an external consultant, whose independence 
is verified by the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee. In this regard, as 
indicated at the end of this section under the title 
"Evaluation of the Board and of its Committees", for the 
evaluation corresponding to the financial year 2023, the 
Company was supported by Egon Zehnder as external 
advisor. 
The Diversity Policy in relation to the Telefónica, S.A. 
Board of Directors and the Selection of Directors is public 
and may be viewed on the corporate website.
Procedure for the Selection, Appointment, Re-
election and Cessation of Directors
Selection and Appointment
As mentioned earlier, Telefónica’s Bylaws provide that the 
Board of Directors shall consist of a minimum of five and a 
maximum of twenty members, who shall be appointed by 
the shareholders at the General Meeting. Specifically, at 
the Annual General Meeting of April 8, 2022, the number 
of members of the Board of Directors was set at fifteen in 
accordance with article 29 of the Bylaws. However, there 
is currently a vacancy on the Board of Directors following 
the passing of the Vice Chairman and Lead Independent 
Director, Mr. José Javier Echenique Landiríbar. 
The Directors shall hold office for a maximum period of 
four years and may be re-elected one or more times for 
periods of the same maximum length. On a provisional 
basis, the Board of Directors, in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act and of the Bylaws, may fill 
existing vacancies on an interim basis, subject to 
ratification at the first General Shareholders' Meeting held. 
Otherwise, and in any event, the proposals for the 
appointment of Directors must comply with the provisions 
of the Bylaws and of the Regulations of the Board of 
Directors, must be preceded by the corresponding report 
of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee and, in the case of Independent 
Directors, by the corresponding proposal. In any event, the 
proposals must be accompanied by a supporting report 
from the Board of Directors assessing the competence, 
experience and merits of the proposed candidate.
In this regard, and in accordance with the responsibilities 
assigned to the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee, this Committee must evaluate 
the skills, knowledge and experience required on the 
Board of Directors, defining the functions and 
competencies required of the candidates who must fill 
each vacancy, and evaluating the specific amount of time 
and dedication that will allow them to perform their duties 
effectively. 
With regard to the latter, and in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 27.2 of the Regulations of the Board of 
Directors, those who are members of more than five 
Boards of Directors of other companies other than 
Telefónica, S.A. and its Group companies may not be 
appointed to the Company's Board. For these purposes, a) 
all Boards of Directors of companies that are part of the 
same Group shall be counted as a single board of 
directors; and b) those Boards of Directors of asset-
holding companies or those that constitute vehicles or 
complements for the professional exercise of the Director 
himself/herself, his/her spouse or person with a similar 
relationship, or his/her closest relatives, shall not be 
counted. As an exception, and for duly justified reasons, 
the Board of Directors may exempt the Director from this 
prohibition.
Similarly, Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee must submit to the Board of 
Directors the proposals for the appointment of 
Independent Directors, whether for their appointment on 
an interim basis or for their submission to a decision by the 
shareholders at the General Shareholders’ Meeting, along 
with the proposals for the re-election or separation of said 
Directors at the General Shareholders’ Meeting. Likewise, 
it must report on the proposals for the appointment of the 
remaining Directors of the Company, whether for their 
appointment on an interim basis or for their submission to 
a decision by the shareholders at the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting, along with the proposals for their 
re-election or separation at the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting. 
Similarly, it shall explain the category of each Director by 
the Board of Directors at the General Shareholders’ 
Meeting at which the shareholders must make or ratify

their appointment. Furthermore, such category shall be 
reviewed annually by the Board, after verification by the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee, and a summary of this review shall be 
included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. 
In any case, and in the event of the re-election or 
ratification of Directors at the General Meeting, the report 
of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee or, in the case of Independent 
Directors, the proposal of said Committee, shall contain an 
assessment of the work and effective dedication to the 
position during the last period of time in which it was held 
by the proposed Director, as well as its ability to continue 
to do so. 
The Board of Directors and the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee 
shall ensure, within the scope of their respective powers, 
that the candidates proposed for the position of Director 
are persons of recognized probity, competence and 
experience, who are willing to devote the time and effort 
required for the performance of their duties, exercising 
rigorous care in the selection of the persons called upon to 
serve as Independent Directors.
The Board of Directors must endeavor to ensure that the 
procedures for the selection of its members promote 
diversity with respect to issues such as age, gender, 
disability, knowledge, education and professional 
experience, and are free from any implicit bias that might 
imply any form of discrimination, and, in particular, 
facilitate the selection of female Directors in such numbers 
as to achieve a balanced presence of women and men. 
In this regard, and as mentioned earlier, at its meeting of 
November 25, 2015 the Board of Directors approved a 
Policy for the Selection of Directors, which on 
December 13, 2017, was updated to include the Diversity 
Policy applicable to the Board of Directors, such that it 
was renamed the Diversity Policy in relation to the 
Telefónica, S.A. Board of Directors and the Selection of 
Board Members. Likewise, on December 16, 2020, the 
Board of Directors approved an update of this Policy to 
reflect the most recent regulatory standards and, in 
particular, to adjust it to the provisions of the 
Recommendations of the Good Governance Code of the 
National Market Securities Commission (CNMV) regarding 
diversity. 
The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee shall verify, on an annual basis, 
compliance with the Policy for the diversity of the Board of 
Directors and selection of Directors, and shall include the 
corresponding summary in the Annual Corporate 
Governance Report and in such other documents as are 
deemed appropriate. In addition, the Board of Directors 
shall periodically evaluate the degree of compliance with 
and effectiveness of the Policy and, in particular, the 
percentage of female Directors at any given time, and a 
detailed description of the Policy, as well as the objectives 
set in this respect and the results obtained, shall be 
included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. 
Likewise, the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee may also propose to the Board of 
Directors any updates and proposed improvements of the 
Policy it deems appropriate.
Re-election
The Company’s Directors may be re-elected one or more 
times for periods of the same length as that of the initial 
period. 
In the same way as proposals for appointments, proposals 
for the re-election of Directors must be preceded by the 
corresponding report of the Nominating, Compensation 
and Corporate Governance Committee, and, in the case of 
Independent Directors, by the corresponding proposal. 
Cessation or Removal 
Directors shall cease to hold office when the time period 
for which they were appointed expires, or when so 
decided by the shareholders at the General Meeting in the 
exercise of the powers legally granted to them. 
When a Director ceases to hold office before the end of 
his or her term, whether by resignation or by resolution of 
the General Meeting, the Director must adequately 
explain in a letter which will be sent to all members of the 
Board of Directors the reasons for leaving office or, in the 
case of non-executive Directors, the Director’s views as to 
the grounds for removal by the shareholders acting at the 
General Meeting. 
In addition, to the extent material to investors, the 
Company shall as soon as possible make public the 
cessation in office, including sufficient information as to 
the reasons or circumstances stated by the Director.
The Board of Directors shall not propose the removal of 
any Independent Director prior to the end of the bylaw-
mandated period for which the said Director was 
appointed, unless due grounds therefor are present, as 
acknowledged by the Board at the proposal of the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee. Specifically, due grounds shall be deemed to 
exist when the Director has failed to perform the duties 
inherent in his position. 
The removal of Independent Directors may also be 
proposed as a result of Public Tender Offers, mergers or 
other similar corporate transactions that entail a change in 
the structure of the company’s capital. 
Likewise, in accordance with the provisions of article 12 of 
the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Directors 
must tender their resignation to the Board of Directors and 
formalize, where appropriate, and depending on the 
circumstances, such resignation in the following cases:

Directors' obligation to inform the Company of 
situations that may damage its credit or reputation
In particular, in accordance with Article 12.3 of the Board of 
Directors' Regulation, Directors must inform when they are 
subject to circumstances, whether or not related to their 
conduct within the Company itself, that may adversely 
affect the standing or reputation thereof, and particularly 
when they are under investigation in any criminal matter, 
in which case the Directors must notify the Company of 
the progress of any such legal proceedings. Having been 
notified or otherwise become aware of any of the 
circumstances mentioned in this paragraph, the Board of 
Directors shall examine the case as soon as possible and, 
based on the specific circumstances, and after a report 
from the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee, shall determine the measures to 
be adopted, including the request for the resignation of 
said Director, which it must accept, or the proposal to 
resign at the next General Meeting. Any such matter shall 
be included in the Annual Corporate Governance Report 
unless special circumstances justify otherwise, which 
circumstances must recorded in formal minutes. Those 
obligations shall be without prejudice to any information 
that the Company must disseminate at the time that any 
such measures are adopted. 
Neither the Bylaws nor the Regulations of the Board 
establish any limit as to the age of the Directors.

The power to call a meeting of the Board of Directors and, 
if appropriate, to draw up the Agenda of the Board’s 
meetings rests with the Chairman of the Board of 
Directors, who must however call a meeting when 
requested to do so by three Directors who indicate the 
issues to be discussed. 
A meeting of the Board of Directors may also be called by 
at least one-third of its members, with an indication of the 
Agenda, if, after the submission of a request to the 
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chairman, without 
just cause, has not called the meeting within a period of 
one month.
The Company adopts the measures that are necessary in 
order for the Directors to have, whenever possible and 
sufficiently in advance, the necessary information, which 
shall be drawn up and oriented specifically toward the 
preparation of the meetings of the Board and of its 
Committees. In no case shall its compliance be waived on 
the grounds of the importance or confidential nature of 
the information, except under absolutely exceptional 
circumstances. 
In this regard, and in accordance with the provisions of 
articles 18 and 20 of the Regulations of the Board of 
Directors, the Board of Directors and its Committees shall 
draw up a calendar of the meetings to be held during the 
year. Such calendar may be modified by resolution of the 
Board itself or of the corresponding Committee, or 
pursuant to a decision by its Chairman, in which case the 
modification must be disclosed to the Directors as soon as 
possible. 
The Board and its Committees also have an Action Plan 
that contains a detailed description and the frequency of 
the activities to be carried out in each fiscal year, 
according to the powers and duties assigned to them.
Similarly, all of the meetings of the Board and of the 
Committee have a pre-established Agenda, which is 
communicated at least three days before the date on 
which the meeting is scheduled to be held, along with the 
call to the meeting. The Agenda for each meeting clearly 
indicates the items regarding which the Board of Directors 
or the Executive Commission must make a decision or 
adopt a resolution. 
With the same goal, in general, the documentation 
associated with the Agenda for the meetings is made 
available to the Directors sufficiently in advance. In this 
regard, and in compliance with the provisions of article 19 
of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Chairman 
of the Board of Directors organizes the discussions, 
seeking and encouraging the active participation of all of 
the Directors in the deliberations, safeguarding the 
unconstrained statement of their viewpoints. Similarly, 
with the assistance of the Secretary, the Chairman 
ensures that the Directors receive beforehand sufficient 
information to deliberate on the items on the Agenda. He 
also ensures that sufficient time is devoted to the 
discussion of strategic issues and stimulates debate 
during the meetings, safeguarding the unconstrained 
statement of viewpoints by the Directors. 
To facilitate the provision of all of the information and 
clarifications that may be necessary regarding some of the 
issues to be addressed, the main officers of the Group 
attend essentially all of the meetings of the Board and of 
its Committees, along with the speakers who are deemed 
appropriate, for the presentation of matters lying within 
their purview, according to the matters to be dealt with on

the agenda for each meeting.  In this regard, before the 
start of the corresponding agenda item, the Chairman 
requests the incorporation of the speakers to participate in 
said item. The speakers present the appropriate 
information and answer the questions raised, but in no 
case do the speakers or any other guests at the meetings 
take part in the deliberations, and this does not affect the 
independence or freedom of judgement of the Directors 
and members of the Board Committees.
Furthermore, and in general, the Regulations of the Board 
of Directors (article 25) expressly provide that the 
Directors are vested with the broadest powers for 
obtaining information about any aspect of the Company 
and to examine its books, records, documents and other 
background materials relating to corporate activities. The 
exercise of this right of information is channeled through 
the Chairman or the Secretary of the Board of Directors, 
who handle requests from the Directors, either providing 
the information directly to the Directors or placing them in 
touch with the proper contact persons at the appropriate 
organizational level. 
The Board of Directors can validly hold a meeting when a 
majority of its serving members are present or represented 
at the meeting. The Directors must personally attend the 
meetings of the Board of Directors. If, under exceptional 
circumstances, they are unable to do so, they shall ensure 
that the proxy they give to another member of the Board 
of Directors includes, insofar as possible, the appropriate 
instructions. Non-executive Directors can delegate their 
proxy only to another non-executive Director. Such 
delegations may be made by letter, mail or in any other 
way that ensures the certainty and validity of the proxy, in 
the opinion of the Chairman of the Board of Directors 
(article 19 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors and 
article 34.4 of the Bylaws). 
In all cases, resolutions are adopted by an absolute 
majority of the votes of the Directors who are present at 
the meeting, either in person or by proxy, except in those 
instances in which, for certain resolutions to be valid, the 
law, the By-Laws or the Regulation of the Board of 
Directors requires the favorable vote of a larger number of 
Directors. 
Board Committees
Both the Bylaws and the Regulations of the Board provide 
for an Executive Commission of the Board of Directors, 
with general decision-making authority and, consequently, 
with the express delegation of all of the powers of the 
Board of Directors, (except for those powers that, by law 
or pursuant to the Bylaws, cannot be delegated), as well 
as for the existence of an Audit and Control Committee 
and a Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee. 
The Regulations also authorize the Board of Directors to 
create one or more advisory or control committees, in 
addition to those mentioned above, entrusted with the 
task of examining and continuously monitoring any area of 
special importance to the good governance of the 
Company, or performing the specific analysis of any factor 
or issue whose significance or magnitude requires it. 
These Committees report to the  Board of Directors 
regarding the conclusions reached on the issues or 
matters that they have been entrusted to review.
As of December 31, 2024, and on the date of issuance of 
this Report, the Board of Directors had and has an 
Executive Commission and three advisory or control 
committees (the Audit and Control Committee, the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee and the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee), whose composition, duties and powers are 
described below.
On the other hand, the meetings held by the Board of 
Directors' Committees, during financial year 2024, were 
held in mixed format, i. e. with the attendance of the 
Directors in person and online. At all these meetings, the 
Secretary of each Committee attested to the identity of all 
the attendees.
In accordance with the provisions of article 20 b) 3. of the 
Regulations of the Board, a full report is delivered to the 
Board of Directors on the matters addressed by the 
Committees, and  so that it will be aware of the said 
matters for the exercise of its responsibilities. At the 
beginning of each of the monthly meetings of the Board of 
Directors, the Chairman of each of the Committees 
delivers a report on the major matters that were 
addressed and on the activities and tasks that were 
carried out by the respective Committee, making available 
to the Directors the corresponding documentation, so that 
the Directors will be aware of such activities for the 
purposes of the exercise of their responsibilities. 
Additionally, and in the same way as the Board of Directors 
itself, all of the Committees prepare, at the start of each 
fiscal year and in accordance with the provisions of article 
20 b) 3. of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, an 
Action Plan that contains a detailed description of, and a 
schedule for, the actions to be taken in each fiscal year in 
each Committee’s individual area of activity. 
Similarly, all of the Committees prepare an Activity 
Memorandum (which, for the Audit and Control 
Committee is called Annual Report on the activity, and the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee, is known as the Report of the Operation), 
which summarize the major activities and actions that 
were carried out during the preceding fiscal year, 
including the details of the matters that were examined 
and addressed at the meetings that were held, and 
emphasizing the aspects associated with their duties and 
responsibilities, composition and performance.

Mechanisms established by the Board of Directors to 
ensure that the Annual Accounts that the Board of 
Directors submits to the General Shareholders' Meeting 
are drawn up in accordance with accounting standards
By virtue of the foregoing, Telefónica's Audit and Control 
Committee is responsible for ensuring that the annual 
accounts that the Board of Directors submits to the 
General Shareholders' Meeting are drawn up in 
accordance with accounting regulations and that, in those 
cases in which the auditor has included a qualification in 
its audit report, the Chairman of the Audit and Control 
Committee must clearly explain to the General 
Shareholders' Meeting the opinion of the Committee on 
the content and scope of the audit report and make a 
summary of such opinion available to the shareholders at 
the time of publication of the notice of the General 
Shareholders' Meeting.
Mechanisms established to preserve the independence of 
external auditors, financial analysts, investment banks and 
rating agencies, including how the legal provisions have 
been implemented in practice
With regard to the independence of the Company's 
external auditor, and in accordance with the provisions of 
Telefónica´s Regulations of the Board of Directors (Article 
39), the Board of Directors has established, through the 
Audit and Control Committee, a stable and professional 
relationship with the Accounts Auditor, with strict respect 
for the independence thereof. 
Furthermore, the Audit and Control Committee, as part of 
its fundamental powers (Article 22 of the Regulations of 
the Board of Directors and Article 4 of the Regulations of 
the Audit and Control Committee), has established and 
maintains the appropriate relationships with the auditors 
to receive information on those matters that may threaten 
their independence, to be considered by the Committee, 
and any others related to the process of carrying out the 
audit, and, where appropriate, the authorisation of services 
other than those prohibited, in accordance with the terms 
set forth in the applicable law, as well as other 
communications set forth in audit legislation and audit 
regulations.
In any case, the Audit and Control Committee annually 
receives the accounts auditor's declaration of 
independence with regard to the Company or entities 
directly or indirectly related to it, as well as detailed and 
personalised information on the additional services of any 
kind provided and the corresponding fees received from 
these entities by the reported auditor, or the persons or 
entities related to him/her in accordance with the 
provisions of current regulations. 
Furthermore, the Committee issues, prior to issuing the 
audit report of the accounts, an annual report that 
expresses an opinion on whether the independence of the 
accounts auditor has been compromised. This report 
states, in any case, the evaluation, with supporting

evidence/rationale, of the provision of each and every one 
of the additional services referred to in the previous 
section, taken into account individually and together, 
different to the statutory audit and in relation to the 
independence regime or the regulations governing 
account auditing. 
On the other hand, as regards financial analysts, 
investment banks and rating agencies, their work and 
actions are developed and carried out in accordance with 
strict criteria, rules of independence and compliance. In 
particular, the agreements entered into by Telefónica, S.A. 
with the rating agencies include clauses recognizing the 
independence of the rating agency and its right to freely 
determine, apply and modify the rating methodologies at 
its sole discretion. 
In any event, the Audit and Control Committee must 
preserve the independence of the statutory auditor in the 
performance of its duties, and in this regard: (i) in the event 
of the resignation of the statutory auditor, examine the 
circumstances giving rise to such resignation; (ii) endeavor 
to ensure that the compensation received by the statutory 
auditor for its work does not compromise the quality or 
independence thereof; (iii) ensure that the Company 
communicates through the CNMV any change in auditor 
and attaches a statement regarding any disagreements 
with the outgoing auditor and, if any, the substance 
thereof; (iv) ensure that the statutory auditor meets 
annually with the full Board of Directors to inform the 
Board of Directors of the work performed and on the 
accounting status and the risks of the Company; and (v) 
ensure that the Company and the statutory auditor 
applicable legal provisions regarding the provision of non-
audit services, limits on the concentration of the auditor’s 
business, and generally all other provisions regarding the 
independence of the auditors.
In addition, and in accordance with the Regulations of the 
Board of Directors (Article 22), the Company's Audit and 
Control Committee puts forward proposals to the Board of 
Directors for the selection, appointment, re-election and 
replacement of the external auditor, taking responsibility 
for the selection process in accordance with the law, as 
well as the terms and conditions of his/her contract, 
regularly obtaining information from the auditor on the 
audit plan and the execution thereof, as well as preserving 
his/her independence in the exercise of his/her duties.
Furthermore, the external auditor has direct access to the 
Audit and Control Committee, participating regularly in its 
meetings, without the presence of members of the 
Company's management team when this is deemed 
necessary. In this regard, and in accordance with the 
requirements of US regulations on this matter, the External 
Auditor reports to the Audit and Control Committee, at 
least on an annual basis, on the most significant 
accounting policies and practices followed in drawing up 
the Company's financial and accounting information, on 
any alternative accounting treatment within generally 
accepted accounting principles and practices that affects 
any relevant element within the financial statements that 
may have been discussed with the management team, 
and, finally, on any relevant communication between the 
auditor and the Company's management team. In addition, 
and in accordance with Article 39 of the Regulations of the 
Board of Directors, the auditor shall hold an annual 
meeting with the full Board of Directors to provide an 
update on the work carried out and the evolution of the 
Company´s accounting and risk situation. 
In accordance with the Company's internal regulations, 
and also in line with the legal requirements imposed by 
Spanish, European and US regulations, contracting any 
service with the Company's External Auditor must always 
be approved beforehand by the Audit and Control 
Committee. Furthermore, this contracting of services, 
other than those of the audit itself, is carried out in strict 
compliance with the Audit Act, European regulations and 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act enacted in the United States and 
its implementing regulations. In this respect, and before 
hiring the auditor, the Audit and Control Committee 
analyses the content of the work to be carried out, 
assessing the situations that may entail a risk to the 
independence of the Company's External Auditor, and 
specifically supervises the percentage represented by the 
fees paid by the latter of the audit firm's total revenue. In 
this regard, the Company states in its Annual Report, in 
accordance with the legal requirements in force, how 
much the Company's External Auditor is paid, including 
those fees related to services of a different nature from 
auditing.
Consequently, the Company has implemented, in practice, 
the legal provisions on this matter as indicated in the 
preceding paragraphs.
c) Operation.
The Audit and Control Committee must have access to 
information in a suitable, timely and sufficient manner, for 
which purpose:
- The Chairman of the Committee and, if deemed 
appropriate or requested, the rest of its Members, shall 
maintain regular contact with the key personnel 
involved in the governance and management of the 
Company. 
- The Chairman of the Committee, through the Secretary 
of the Committee, shall channel and provide the 
necessary information and documentation to the other 
members of the Committee, allowing sufficient time for 
them to analyze such information prior to their 
meetings. 
This information shall be available through the 
corresponding information technology application, 
enabled by the Company for the handling of the 
documentation associated with this Committee.

The Audit and Control Committee shall meet at least once 
every quarter, and whenever a meeting is deemed 
appropriate, in response to a call from its Chairman. In any 
event, the Committee shall meet, at a minimum, on each 
date on which annual or interim financial information is 
published. In such cases, the Internal Auditor shall be 
present. If any type of review report is issued, the Auditor 
shall also be present. 
In this regard, and with reference to the meetings held 
with the Statutory Auditor and with the Internal Auditor, 
the provisions of article 7 of the Regulations of the 
Company’s Audit and Control Committee are complied 
with, which provisions establish that, for the proper 
exercise of its supervisory function, the Committee must 
be familiar with, and understand, the decisions made by 
Senior Management regarding the application of the most 
significant criteria and the results of the reviews 
conducted by the Internal Audit Office, while maintaining 
fluid communications with the Statutory Auditor. In point 
of fact, the External Auditor has participated in meetings 
of the Audit and Control Committee in order to explain the 
work that was done, and also to clarify, at the request of 
Committee, those issues that may have been raised in 
connection with the duties assigned to such External 
Auditor. The members of the Committee also held 
separate meetings with each of these contact persons 
when such meetings were deemed necessary, in order to 
conduct a rigorous follow-up of the preparation of the 
Company’s financial information. 
During 2024, the Audit and Control Committee held 14 
meetings, lasting on average two hours each. Also 
noteworthy is the high level of participation of all of its 
members. 
Likewise, in the fulfillment of its duties, the Committee may 
request the presence of the following persons at its 
meetings: the Statutory Auditor, the head of the Internal 
Audit Office, any Director, employee or Officer of the 
Company and the experts that it deems appropriate.
Attendance at the formal meetings of the Committee shall 
be preceded by the allocation, on the part of its Members, 
of sufficient time to analyze and evaluate the information 
received by them. 
The Committee also has a Secretary, as well as the 
necessary support staff for planning meetings and 
agendas; for drafting documents and meeting minutes; 
and for compiling and distributing information, among 
other tasks. 
For the purposes of appropriate scheduling that makes it 
possible to ensure the efficient accomplishment of the 
objectives pursued, the Committee establishes an Annual 
Work Plan. 
The meetings are scheduled by the Chairman of the 
Committee, who communicates them to the Secretary of 
the Committee, so that its members will receive the 
documentation sufficiently in advance. All of these actions 
are performed bearing in mind that the duties of the 
Members of the Committee are fundamentally supervisory 
and advisory, with no involvement in execution or 
management, which are the responsibility of Senior 
Management.

Management. 
The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee shall consult the Chairman of the 
Board of Directors, particularly with regard to matters 
involving the Executive Directors and Senior Executives.
Most important activities during the fiscal year and 
fulfillment of duties.
The primary activities and actions performed by the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee of the Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. 
during fiscal year 2024 have been associated with the 
powers and functions of such Committee or with legal 
requirements or with Telefónica's internal regulations. 
Accordingly, the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee has analyzed and 
reported on the following issues, among others:
a)  Proposals and/or reports on appointments associated 
with the Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. and its 
Committees. 
At its meeting held on February 20, 2024, the 
Committee unanimously resolved to appoint Mr. Peter 
Löscher as Chairman of the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, 
replacing Mr. José Javier Echenique Landiríbar, who 
continued to serve on the Committee as a Member 
until December 15, 2024, the date of his death. 
Likewise, and in relation to the proposals to be 
submitted to the shareholders at the Company's 
Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting of 2024, the 
Committee, at its meeting held on March 7, 2024, 
passed the following resolutions:

appointment (co-option) of Ms. Solange Sobral 
Targa and Mr. Alejandro Reynal Ample as

the classification of Independent Directors. 
Regarding the above proposals for the re-election of 
Directors, the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee has reviewed and 
evaluated the performance and commitment of each 
such Director during their term of office and, in each 
case, has concluded that the work of these Directors 
has been satisfactory, efficient and diligent and that 
their effective dedication to their duties has been 
appropriate.
Furthermore, at its meeting held on May 7, 2024, the 
Committee reported favorably to the Board of 
Directors on the voluntary resignation of Ms. Carmen 
García de Andrés from her position as Director of 
Telefónica, S.A. and, consequently, from all of her 
positions on the Board of Directors and the

Consequently, and in order to fill the aforementioned 
vacancy, at the same meeting the Committee reported 
favorably on the interim appointment (co-option) of Mr. 
Carlos Ocaña Orbis as a Proprietary Director, at the 
proposal of the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones 
Industriales (SEPI), thus responding to the formal

(or non-financial information) in accordance with 
international reference standards.
10)  In relation to the non-financial indicators in the area 
of sustainability of the variable remuneration of 
Directors and Senior Executives, be aware of and 
inform the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee of these indicators, in order 
to facilitate their better contribution to the business 
strategy of sustainability and to the long-term 
interests of the Company and the Group in this area.
11)
Any other matters related to the fields within its 
competence that are requested by the Board of 
Directors or its Chairman.
In relation to these functions, and regarding sustainability 
issues, Telefónica wants to be a relevant player in the 
communities in which it operates, internalizing in its 
strategy and way of operating the impacts of its activities 
on society and the environment. Its purpose, in this area, is 
to make the world more human, connecting people's lives, 
which implies that it is always attentive to how it can 
contribute to generate a positive impact through its 
products and services, trying to minimize any negative 
impact that its activities may cause.  It is about being an 
ethical and responsible Company, and Telefónica's 
strategy and governance reflect that concern. 
  
The Group's Responsible Business Principles and 
Responsible Business Plan respectively form the ethical 
framework and roadmap for sustainability, and both are 
approved by the Board of Directors, as well as the Group's 
most relevant policies in this area (see the Sustainability 
Report 2024). Furthermore, the Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee supervises the implementation of 
the Responsible Business Plan at its monthly meetings.   
The Group's Responsible Business Plan details objectives 
and projects related to the Company's sustainability 
management, including, among others, respect for Human 
Rights, customer responsibility, privacy commitments, 
freedom of expression and information, security, ethical 
management of artificial intelligence, responsible 
management of technology, sustainable management of 
the supply chain, climate change and environmental 
strategy, promotion of diversity, safety and well-being of 
our employees, as well as a business strategy focused on 
generating products and services that contribute to 
addressing society's major social and environmental 
challenges (sustainable innovation).   
Some of the most relevant objectives of the Responsible 
Business Plan are considered in determining the variable 
compensation of the Company's employees.  
The full details of the sustainability governance structure 
can be found in chapter 2.4. Governance of the 
Sustainability Report 2024.

The assessments for the 2021 and 2022 financial years 
were carried out internally by the Company, without the 
support of an external advisor; for the evaluation for the 
financial year 2023, the Board of Directors, on the proposal 
of the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee, was supported by the Consulting 
Firm Egon Zehnder as external advisor; and the evaluation 
for the financial year 2024 has been carried out internally 
by the Company, without the support of an external 
consultant.
Specifically, at the end of the 2024 financial year, all 
Directors were given a questionnaire to carry out the 
evaluation process for that year. 
The questionnaire contained a wide range of questions 
grouped under the following headings:
• The Board of Directors: Composition, Function and 
Powers, expressly including the adequacy of the 
performance and contribution of i) each Director on the 
Board of Directors, ii) the Chairman of the Board, iii) the 
Lead Independent Director, and iv) the Secretary of the 
Board.  
• Committees of the Board of Directors: Composition, 
Function and Powers, expressly including the 
performance and input of i) the Committee Chairs, and 
ii) the Secretariat for these Committees.
• Rights and Duties of Directors. 
• Stakeholders and General Shareholders' Meeting.
• Suggestions and Comments.
The Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee, at its meeting held on January 28, 
2025, reviewed and analysed the results of this evaluation, 
concluding that, in general, the aspects related to the 
Board of Directors, Committees and General Meeting had 
been highly valued and were considered optimal and 
competent on the whole. 
However, as a result of this evaluation, and in order to 
continue promoting the improvement of the company's 
corporate governance system, certain areas for 
optimisation were identified, in view of which, and after a 
detailed examination and analysis of the results achieved, 
the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the  Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee, at 
its meeting of January 29, 2025, established an Action Plan 
for the implementation of the following suggestions and 
recommendations: 
• With regard to the matters included in the Agendas of 
the meetings, we will consider introducing, when 
deemed appropriate, more matters related to (i)  
business (customers, offers, digital transformation), (ii) 
the Company's long-term strategy and (iii) strategic 
development linked to technological changes, as well as, 
if necessary, scheduling additional sessions when 
deemed appropriate.
• To continue to offer the members of the Board training 
and refresher knowledge  programs on a continuous 
basis on those aspects that are of special importance for 
the performance of their duties.
• Finally, to continue working on the optimization of the 
process of making the documentation of the meetings of 
the Board and its Committees available to the Board 
Members, so that it is made available to them, whenever 
possible, sufficiently in advance.

4.5. Transactions with Related 
Parties and Conflicts of Interest 
4.5.1. Transactions with Related Parties 
• The procedure for approval of related-party and   
intragroup transactions  
As mentioned above, the Board of Directors, at its 
meeting held on June 29 and 30, 2021, and at the 
proposal of the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee, approved the partial 
amendment of the company's Board of Directors’ 
Regulations which basically consists of adapting them to 
the novelties of Law 5/2021 of April 12, which amends 
the revised text of the Capital Companies Act and other 
financial regulations with regard to the promotion of 
long-term shareholder involvement in listed companies 
(Law 5/2021). Specifically, the Board of Directors' 
Regulations were adapted to the amendments 
introduced by Law 5/2021 to the regime of related-party 
transactions applicable to listed companies. 
Likewise, the Board of Directors, at its aforementioned 
meeting held on June 29 and 30, 2021, approved, in 
coordination with the aforementioned amendment of 
the Board of Directors’ Regulations, to partially amend 
the Regulations of the Audit and Control Committee, in 
order to incorporate the changes introduced in the 
Board of Directors’ Regulations.
Following the aforementioned amendment, Article 5.4 of 
the Board of Directors’ Regulations includes the 
following non-delegable powers of the Board, among 
others: 
The approval, subject to a report from the Audit and 
Control Committee, of related-party transactions under 
the terms established in Article 37 of these Regulations, 
unless its approval corresponds to the General Meeting.
The Company’s Board of Directors may delegate the 
approval of transactions between companies forming 
part of its group that are carried out within the scope of 
ordinary management and under market conditions, as 
well as transactions entered into under contracts whose 
standard conditions are applied en masse to a large 
number of customers, carried out at prices or rates 
established on a general basis, and whose amount does 
not exceed 0.5% of the net turnover of the company, 
determined in accordance with the rules of calculation 
laid down in the Law. 
In this regard, and in accordance with the provisions of 
article 29.f) of the Board of Directors' Regulations:
No Director may directly or indirectly carry out 
professional or commercial operations or transactions 
with the company or with any of the companies of its 
group, when such operations or transactions are outside 
the ordinary course of business or are not carried out 
under market conditions, except for those operations or 
transactions that are authorised by the company under 
the terms provided for in the regime on related-party 
transactions established by law, in the Articles of 
Association, and in these Regulations. 
Article 37 of the Board of Directors' Regulations 
establishes the following with regard to the regime on 
related-party transactions: 
1.
The Board of Directors, subject to a favourable 
report from the Audit and Control Committee, 
shall approve transactions that the company or 
its subsidiaries carry out with directors, 
shareholders holding 10% or more of the voting 
rights or represented on the company’s Board 
of Directors, or any other persons who should 
be considered related parties under the terms 
of the law, provided that, under current 
legislation, they are considered to be related 
party transactions, and unless their approval 
corresponds to the General Shareholders' 
Meeting. This power cannot be delegated, 
except in the cases and under the terms 
provided for in the law and in Article 5.4 of these 
Regulations. 
2.       In relation to the adoption of the motion to 
approve related-party transactions whose 
competence corresponds to the Board of 
Directors and has not been delegated, the 
Director involved or the Director representing or 
related to the shareholder involved must abstain 
from participating in the deliberation and voting 
in accordance with the provisions of the law. 
3.       In the event that the Board of Directors 
delegates the approval of related-party

transactions in accordance with the provisions 
of the law and Article 5.4 of these Regulations, 
the Board of Directors itself shall establish an 
internal procedure of information and periodic 
control in relation thereto, in which the Audit 
and Control  Committee shall intervene, in order 
to verify the fairness and transparency of these 
transactions and, where appropriate, 
compliance with the applicable legal criteria. 
The approval of such transactions shall not 
require a prior report from the Audit and Control 
Committee.
4.       In relation to related-party transactions whose 
approval depends on the General Meeting, the 
proposed motion for approval adopted by the 
Board of Directors shall be submitted to the 
General Meeting with an indication as to 
whether it has been approved by the Board of 
Directors with or without the majority of the 
independent Directors voting against. 
Likewise, Article 4, section xiv) of the current Regulations 
of the Audit and Control Committee establishes, among 
the competencies of this Committee, the following:
Report on related party transactions to be approved by 
the General Meeting or the Board of Directors and 
supervise the internal procedure established by the 
Company for those transactions whose approval has 
been delegated by the Board of Directors, as the case 
may be.
In relation to the above, and within the framework of the 
aforementioned regulation, the Board of Directors of the 
Company, at its meeting held on June 29 and 30, 2021, 
following a favourable report from the Audit and Control 
Committee, moved to establish a generic delegation for 
the approval of all related-party transactions that are so 
allowed, that is:
a.
Intra-group transactions (companies subject to 
a potential conflict of interest) that are carried 
out in the ordinary course of business and on an 
arm's length basis; and
b.       Transactions which are concluded under 
contracts whose standardised conditions are 
applied en masse to a large number of 
customers, made at general prices or rates, and 
whose amount does not exceed 0.5% of the 
company's net turnover. 
Such delegation was made to the bodies or persons 
who, in accordance with the general powers of attorney 
in force at any given moment and the internal 
contracting regulations of Telefónica, S.A. and the other 
applicable companies in its group, and in accordance 
with the functions they perform within the Telefónica 
Group (such as financing, telecommunications services 
and all those derived from the ordinary business of the 
group), have the powers to carry out such delegation.
The approval of the related-party transactions referred 
to in the aforementioned delegation motion of the Board 
of Directors, does not require a prior report from the 
Audit and Control Committee, although such 
transactions must be reported half-yearly to the Audit 
and Control Committee and the Board of Directors in 
order to verify the fairness and transparency of such 
transactions and, where appropriate, compliance with 
the applicable legal criteria.
During fiscal year 2024 neither Telefónica, S.A. nor any 
company in its Group has carried out transactions with 
any member of the Board of Directors or with any Senior 
Executives other than those derived from the Group's 
ordinary business or traffic, except as indicated in the 
following paragraph in respect of transactions with 
parties related.
Notwithstanding the above, the significant and relevant 
transactions carried out by companies of the Telefónica 
Group with related parties are included in Note 11 
(Related Parties) and in Note 10 (Associates and joint 
ventures) of the Consolidated Annual Accounts of 
Telefónica, S.A. of Telefónica, S.A. corresponding to 
fiscal year 2024, as in Section D of the Statistical Annex 
of the Annual Corporate Governance Report.
4.5.2. Conflicts of Interest 
Company policy establishes the following principles 
governing possible conflicts of interest that may affect 
Directors, Senior Executives or significant Shareholders: 
•  With respect to Directors, Article 29 of the 
Regulations of the Board of Directors establishes that 
Directors shall inform the Board of Directors of any 
situation of direct or indirect conflict they may have 
with the interest of the Company. In the event of 
conflict, the Director affected shall refrain from 
participating in the transaction to which the conflict 
refers. 
Moreover, and in accordance with the provisions set 
out in the Regulations of the Board, Directors shall 
refrain from participating in votes that affect matters in 
which they or persons related to them have a direct or 
indirect interest.  
It is also established that Directors may not directly or 
indirectly carry out professional or commercial 
operations or transactions with the Company or with 
any of the companies of its Group, when such 
operations or transactions are outside the ordinary 
course of business or are not carried out under market 
conditions, except for those operations or transactions 
that are authorised by the Company under the terms

provided for in the regime on related-party 
transactions established by law, in the Articles of 
Association and in the Regulations of the Board of 
Directors (regime described in section 4.5.1. above).   
Directors must also report with respect to themselves 
as well as the persons related thereto (a) the direct or 
indirect interests held by them and (b) the offices held 
or duties performed at any company that is in a 
situation of actual competition with the Company. 
For purposes of the provisions of this paragraph, the 
following shall not be deemed to be in a situation of 
actual competition with the Company, even if they 
have the same or a similar or complementary corporate 
purpose: (i) companies controlled thereby (within the 
meaning of Article 42 of the Commercial Code); and (ii) 
companies with which Telefónica, S.A. has established 
a strategic alliance. Likewise, for purposes of the 
provisions hereof, proprietary Directors of competitor 
companies appointed at the request of the Company 
or in consideration of the Company’s interest in the 
capital thereof shall not be deemed to be in a situation 
of prohibition of competition.  
Transactions arising from the duty of loyalty and its 
exemption regime shall also be subject to prevailing 
laws.  
• With regard to significant shareholders, Article 37 of 
the Board Regulations establishes that the Board of 
Directors, following a favourable report from the Audit 
and Control Committee, shall approve transactions 
that the company or its subsidiaries carry out with 
shareholders holding 10% or more of the voting rights 
or represented on the Company’s Board of Directors, 
provided that, under current legislation, they are 
considered to be related-party transactions, and 
unless their approval corresponds to the General 
Shareholders' Meeting. This power cannot be 
delegated, except in the cases and under the terms 
provided by law and in Article 5.4 of the Company's 
Board of Directors’ Regulations, as described in 
section 4.5.1 above.
• With respect to Senior Executives, the Internal Code 
of Conduct for Securities Markets Issues, updated on 
May 6, 2020, sets out the general principles of 
conduct for the persons subject to the said regulations 
who are involved in a conflict of interest. The 
aforementioned Code includes all the Company's 
management personnel within the concept of affected 
persons. 
In accordance with that established in this Regulation, 
the People with Management Responsibilities, their 
Administrative Personnel and the managers or 
employees of Telefónica Group who have Inside 
Information, or participate or have access to or 
knowledge of a Confidential Operation (as defined in 
the previous terms of the Internal Code of Conduct for 
Securities Markets Issues) have the obligation to (a) 
remain loyal to the Group and its shareholders at all 
times, regardless of his/her own or other's interests; (b) 
refrain from intervening in or influencing decision 
making that could affect persons or companies with 
which there is conflict; and (c) refrain from accessing 
information classified as confidential that affects said 
conflict. Additionally, these people (except for the 
members of the Company Board of Directors who will 
be governed in terms of communicating conflicts 
under the standards established in the regulation of 
the Board of Directors) have the obligation to make the 
Company aware of these situations, by means of the 
computer system established by Telefónica for this 
purpose, as soon as possible, that would potentially 
entail the manifestation of conflicts of interest because 
of its activities outside the Telefónica Group, its family 
relationships, its personal assets or any other reason 
with: (a) financial intermediaries operating with the 
Group Telefónica; (b) professional or institutional 
investors who have a significant relationship with the 
Group Telefónica; (c) suppliers of significant 
equipment or material; or (d) professional service 
providers or External Advisors. 
Telefónica, S.A. is the only company of the Telefónica 
Group that is listed in Spain, so it is not necessary to 
have defined the specific mechanisms that would be 
applied to resolve possible conflicts of interest with 
subsidiaries listed in Spain. 
Based on the information provided above, it is also 
noted that Telefónica, S.A. is not controlled by another 
entity within the meaning of Article 42 of the 
Commercial Code.

control and risk management. 
In addition, it should be noted that, based on the 
relevance of any new accounting developments, the staff 
of the departments involved in financial reporting attend 
(when possible and/or necessary) technical sessions 
given by external companies, related to the main 
developments in accounting. 
Finally, the Group offers the Corporate University 
“Universitas Telefónica” with the objective of contributing 
to the Group’s progress through the ongoing 
development of its professionals. All the programs in the 
training offer of the University of Telefónica are based on 
the development of the corporate culture, the business 
strategy and management and leadership competences. 
4.7.2. Risk Assessment of Financial 
Information  
Main characteristics of the risk identification 
process, including those related to error or 
fraud.  
The ICFR was developed by the Group in accordance 
with international internal control standards established 
by COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, of the 
Treadway Commission), in its Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework report of 2013, which establishes 
five components in which the effectiveness and 
efficiency of internal control systems should be based:
• Establish an effective internal control environment, 
emphasizing organizational culture, integrity and ethical 
values.
• Assess the risks that an entity could incur in compiling 
its financial information.
• Design and implement the necessary controls to 
mitigate the risks identified, ensuring that actions are 
aligned with the financial reporting objectives of the 
Organization.
• Establish the appropriate information and 
communication circuits to support effective decision 
making and control processes, including those related 
to the detection and communication of system 
weaknesses or inefficiencies.
• Monitor said controls to ensure their effective design 
and operability, as well as the validity of their 
effectiveness over time.
Given the width of the universe of processes with impact 
on financial reporting at the Telefónica Group, a model 
has been developed to select the most relevant

processes based both on risk assessment and Group 
materiality, the so-called Scope Definition Model, and 
which is a part of the Audit Methodology on the  Internal 
Control over Financial Information (ICFR) System of the 
Telefónica Group. This model, based both in the principle 
of relative importance and the assessment of risks related 
to financing reporting at Group level, is applied to the 
financial information reported by subsidiaries multi-group 
and associate companies. The model selects the 
significant accounts at the consolidated level, the 
evaluation of ICFR of the Group can be upholded. 
Subsequently, identifies the relevant processes which 
generate the financial information for these epigraphs or 
accounts.
Once the relevant processes have been identified, an 
understanding is made on those processes that have a 
more relevant impact on significant accounts, to review, 
in the first instance, the effectiveness of the design of 
their internal control structures, and in a second phase, 
the operating of the key controls which address the main 
associated risks or “objectives of control of financial 
information” (also named as financial assumptions or 
assertions).Given that the internal control evaluation the 
Group’s financial reporting is performed as of the closing 
date of each year, throughout the year, and up until  the 
corresponding activities are carried out to contrast the 
results obtained through the Scope Definition Model.
The aforementioned procedure for identifying and 
reviewing the key controls covers the objectives of the 
financial information (also named financial premises) of 
accuracy, valuation, completeness, cut-off of operations, 
existence / occurrence, presentation, breakdown, and 
rights and obligations. This identification of the key 
controls, aimed at addressing the aforementioned 
financial premises of the significant accounts and 
relevant processes in scope, is carried out annually, 
verifying that no event has taken place so as to determine 
a modification of this as at the year-end date.  
With regard to the process for identifying the company 
perimeter, the Finance and Control Office carries out, in a 
periodic manner, an update on its consolidation 
perimeter, verifying additions and removals of companies 
with the legal and financial departments of the different 
companies which are part of the Group, including the 
corporate departments. 
As previously mentioned, Telefónica constantly monitors 
the most significant risks that could affect the main 
companies that make up its Group. For that purpose the 
Company has a Risk Management Model based on 
COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission). It is implemented in a 
homogeneous manner in the main operations of the 
Group, and the persons responsible for the Company, in 
their field of action, carry out a timely identification, 
assessment, response and monitoring of the main risks. 
Telefónica’s risk management, including those related to 
financial information, is integrated into the planning 
process and is aligned with the Company’s strategy, in 
line with the requirements of COSO ERM 2017, 
“Enterprise Risk Management - Integrating with Strategy 
and Performance”.
The Board of Directors of the Company, through the 
Audit and Control Committee, is the entity’s governing 
body that supervises the previous process, as defined in 
Article 22 of the Regulation of the Board of Directors of 
Telefónica. 
4.7.3. Control Activities 
Procedures for reviewing and authorizing the 
financial information and the description of the 
ICFR, to be disclosed in the securities market, 
indicating those responsible, as well as the 
documents describing the flow of activities and 
controls (including those related to fraud risk) of 
different types of transactions that may 
materially affect the financial statements, 
including the accounts closing procedure and 
specific review of relevant value judgements, 
estimates, valuations and projections.
The Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. approved, on 
March 29, 2023, an update of the "Regulations Governing 
Disclosure and Reporting to the Markets" (RCIM) to 
reflect, among other issues, the treatment of non-
financial information and information on sustainability for 
the purposes of Communication and Information to the 
Markets. This regulation regulates the basic principles of 
functioning of the financial disclosure control processes 
and systems for reporting economic-financial and 
sustainability information and any other information that 
the Company considers necessary to publish, through 
which to aim at guaranteeing that the Company’s 
relevant or privileged information is known by the 
markets, investors and other stakeholders, thus 
maximizing the disclosure and quality of this information, 
and ensuring that the mechanisms required to perform 
regular evaluations of the functioning of these processes 
and systems are established.  
In addition, on a quarterly basis, the Consolidation and 
Accounting Polices Department (which forms part of the 
Finance and Control Department) of Telefónica submits 
to the Audit and Control Committee the periodic financial 
information, highlighting the main events occurred and 
the accounting criteria applied in its preparation, 
clarifying those aspects of major importance occurred 
during the period.
Likewise, the Telefónica Group has documented 
economic-financial processes in place which enable that 
the criteria for preparing financial information are 
common, both in the companies of the Group and in 
those activities that are outsourced, if any. 
Likewise, the Company follows documented procedures 
for preparing the consolidated financial information, so

that the persons responsible for the different areas 
involved verify this information. 
Additionally, in accordance with internal regulations, the 
Executive Chairmen or Chief Executive Officers and the 
Finance Directors of the companies of the Group must 
submit to the Consolidation and Accounting Policies 
Office an annual certificate stating that the financial 
statements presented fairly present in all material 
respects the equity, the financial position, the results of 
operations and the cash flows as of the date and for the 
period presented.
In relation to the accounting closing procedure, the 
Consolidation and Accounting Polices Office issues the 
reporting and external audit instructions (in the case of 
external audits, for the purposes of information of 
schedules and reports to be issued) aligned with the 
internal control assessment approach over the financial 
reporting of Internal Audit; which includes the content, 
procedures and schedule to be followed by the 
departments and companies of the Telefónica Group as 
well as investee entities through joint control agreements 
(joint ventures and operations) or material entities over 
which it exercises significant influence and through its 
external auditors in the reporting of the financial-
accounting information and the results of the audit 
processes. 
The specific review on relevant judgments, estimates, 
valuations and projections is carried out by the 
Consolidation and Accounting Polices Office, to identify 
critical accounting policies to the extent that they require 
the use of estimates and value judgements. In these 
cases, the Consolidation and Accounting Polices Office 
establishes, likewise, the necessary operational 
coordination actions with the rest of the units in the 
Telefónica Group in their specific fields of action and 
knowledge, prior to presenting them to the Audit and 
Control Committee. The most relevant ones are dealt 
with by the Audit and Control Committee and Senior 
Management defines the presentation format in the 
annual accounts, prior to approval by the Board of 
Directors. 
Finally, Internal Audit, within its Annual Audit Plan, among 
other actions, establishes work plans to assess the model 
for internal control over financial reporting of the 
Telefónica Group, in line with the above stated. 
Internal control policies and procedures on 
information systems (among others, on access 
security, change control, system operation, 
operation continuity, separation of functions) 
that support the relevant processes of the 
company with regard to the preparation and 
publication of financial information. 
The Global Security Policy of Telefónica considers an 
integral concept that encompasses the physical and 
operational security (of people and assets), digital 
security, business continuity, supply chain security and 
prevention of commercial fraud. In order to reach a 
homogeneous level of security, a global corporate 
security regulatory Framework is defined that will take 
into account the analysis of threats and risks, as well as 
the establishment of preventive, detection and corrective 
controls, in the activities aimed at identify, protect, detect, 
respond and recover. 
The Global Director of Security and Intelligence leads the 
development and monitors the implementation of the 
regulatory framework and global security initiatives. For 
more information, see the Security section of Telefónica's 
Global Transparency Centre.
The Telefonica Group’s Global Information and 
Technology Department is responsible for the 
technological strategy of both the Network and the 
Information Technology System for the Group's main 
operating markets, defining the strategy and 
technological planning, as well as its evolution and 
ensuring compliance with the quality of service, cost and 
security conditions required by the Group. Among its 
various functions are the definition of Systems and 
Networks that improve the efficiency, effectiveness and 
profitability of the Group's processes. For operators in 
Latin America, these same functions are assumed and 
carried out by the regional Network and Systems 
Department but always based on the guidelines set out 
by the Global Directorate for Technology and Information.
Finally, the Internal Audit unit, based on the scope 
established in each Annual Audit Plan, executes certain 
procedures to verify the effectiveness of design and 
operation, as well the efficiency of the defined internal 
control environment, to ensure compliance with all Group 
policies and regulations on Security and Data Processing 
and Protection, focusing on the governance model and 
the integrity accuracy of the information, reviewing in the 
audit work the effectiveness of the internal control 
structures defined and implemented, both in their design 
and operation and on the basis of the established scope.
Internal control policies and procedures aimed 
at supervising the managing of activities 
outsourced to third parties, as well as those 
aspects of assessment, calculation or valuation 
commended to independent experts that may 
affect in a material manner the financial 
statements. 
In the case that a process or part of a process is 
outsourced to a third party unrelated to the Company, 
this does not exempt from the need to have controls 
which ensure an adequate control level in the whole of 
the process. Given the importance of service outsourcing 
and the consequences that this can cause on the opinion 
about the effectiveness of the internal control over 
financial reporting, the necessary actions are taken in the 
Telefónica Group in order to achieve to evidence an 
adequate control level. The actions that are carried out to 
achieve the mentioned objective may vary among the

three following ones, which, depending on the case, may 
be complementary:
• Certification of internal control by an independent 
third party: ISAE 3402, SSAE 18, SOC or analogous, 
certifications in their different typologies. 
• Establishing specific controls: identified, designed, 
implemented and assessed by the Company and/or the 
Telefónica Group.
• Direct assessment: an assessment, carried out by the 
Internal Audit area, on certain outsourced processes, 
with the scope established in its Annual Audit Plan, as 
appropriate. 
When Telefónica or any of its subsidiaries uses the 
services of an independent expert whose result and 
conclusions may present potential impacts on the 
consolidated financial information, with regard to the 
process to select a supplier, the area that requests the 
service and, if applicable, together with the Purchase 
department, must make sure about the competence, 
training, credentials and independence of the third party 
regarding the methods and main hypotheses considered. 
The Finance and Control Office has established control 
activities aimed at guaranteeing the validity of data, the 
methods used, and the reasonability of the hypotheses 
used by the third party through the recurrent monitoring 
on the own KPIs1 of each duty which enable to ensure 
compliance of the outsourced process according to the 
policies and guidelines issued by the Group. In terms of 
security, we have requirements for our suppliers, and we 
identify and monitor the risks associated with the 
provision of a service/product (for more information, see 
the Security in the Supply Chain section of Telefónica's 
Global Transparency Centre).
Likewise, there is an internal procedure for engaging 
independent experts which requires certain levels of 
approval. 
4.7.4. Information and 
Communication 
A specific function in charge of defining, keeping 
updated the accounting policies (area or 
department of accounting policies) and 
resolving issues or conflicts derived from its 
interpretation, maintaining fluid communication 
with those responsible for operations in the 
organization, as well as an updated accounting 
policy manual informed to the units through 
which the entity operates.                                                             
                                                                                                                    
The Consolidation and Accounting Polices Office of the 
Group is in charge of defining and updating the 
accounting policies for the purposes of preparing and 
reporting consolidated financial information. 
Thus, this area publish news and updated Information 
Bulletins on IFRS (International Financial Reporting 
Standards), where this area presents a summary of the 
main changes in accounting matters, as well as 
clarifications on various aspects that may arise regarding 
this matter. 
Additionally, the Telefónica Group has a Manual of 
Accounting Policies which is permanently updated. The 
objectives of this Manual are: to adapt the corporate 
accounting principles and policies to the IFRS regulatory 
framework; to maintain accounting principles and policies 
which enable that the information is comparable within 
the Group and which facilitate an optimum management 
from the origin of the information; to improve the quality 
of the accounting information of the various Group 
companies and of the Consolidated financial information 
by disclosing, agreeing and implementing accounting 
principles which are unique to the Group; and to facilitate 
the accounting integration of acquired and newly-
created companies into the Group’s accounting system 
by means of having a reference Manual. 
All companies belonging to the Telefónica Group must 
comply in a mandatory manner with the mentioned 
Manual when carrying out their reporting for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial information. 
This documentation is available for the whole Group on 
the Telefónica Intranet in an integrated Accounting and 
Reporting portal. In this portal, in addition to the 
digitalized Manual, the history of IFRS Bulletins can be 
accessed, as well as the Reporting Manual with its forms 
and all the details of the corporate chart of accounts. All 
accounting and reporting update communications are 
made through this tool, which is part of the Group’s digital 
transformation project.
Likewise, the Accounting Policies Area maintains a fluid 
communication with the accounting heads of the Group's 
main operations, both proactively and reactively. This 
communication is useful not only for resolving doubts or 
conflicts but also to ensure that accounting criteria in the 
Group are homogeneous as well as to share best 
practices among Group companies.
Mechanisms for obtaining and preparing the 
financial information with standardized formats 
applied and used by all the units in the entity or 
the Group, which support the main financial 
statements and notes, as well as information 
detailing the ICFR.
As stated above, there is a Manual for Filling in the 
Consolidation Reporting of the Telefónica Group which 
provides specific instructions for preparing the details 
which make up the financial-accounting reporting 
package, provided by all components of the Telefónica

Group for the preparation of the Telefónica Group’s 
consolidated financial statements and its explanatory 
notes. 
Likewise, the Telefónica Group has implemented a 
specific system, through an IT System, which supports 
the reporting of the individual financial statements of its 
various subsidiaries, as well as the necessary notes and 
disclosures for preparing the consolidated annual 
accounts. This tool is used, likewise, to carry out the 
consolidation process and its subsequent analysis. The 
system is managed centrally, and all components of the 
Telefónica Group use the same account plan.
4.7.5. Supervision of System 
Operation 
The supervision activities and results of the ICFR 
evaluation performed during the year. Procedure 
for which the person responsible performs the 
evaluation establishes the scope and reports 
their results, with the entity defining an action 
plan that details the pertinent corrective 
measures and consideration of its impact on the 
financial information.                                                                                                        
As indicated above, the Corporate Bylaws and the 
Regulation of the Board of Directors state that the 
primary duty of the Audit and Control Committee shall be 
to support the Board of Directors in its supervisory duties, 
establishing among its competencies to supervise the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls and the 
systems for risk management and control, as well as to 
discuss, where appropriate, with the Account Auditors 
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the 
internal control system over financial reporting (ICFR) 
detected during the development of both the integrated 
audit performed by the Account Auditor and the 
evaluation of internal control on the Group’s financial 
reporting at the end of each year, carried out by Internal 
Audit. 
Along the same lines as the above, Telefónica has a 
Corporative Internal Control Policy that sets that the 
Board of Directors, through the Audit and Control 
Committee, supervises the internal control system, with 
the support of Internal Audit of the Telefónica Group. In 
that Policy, “internal control” is defined as the process 
performed by the Board of Directors, Management and 
the rest of the staff of the Company, being designed with 
the purpose of providing a reasonable assurance degree 
for the attainment of the objectives related to operations, 
information and compliance. With the purpose of helping 
to the achievement of its objectives, the Company has an 
internal control model defined in accordance with the 
criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). 
Likewise, there is an Internal Audit Organization Policy, 
which includes aspects regarding the organization and 
functioning of this area, including its statute. According to 
what is set in that Policy and in the Corporate Internal 
Control Policy itself, Internal Audit is the area in 
Telefónica in charge of confirming, by means of 
appropriate evidence, the adequate functioning of the 
internal control and risk management structures and, if 
applicable, detecting possible inefficiencies or non-
compliance with the control system that the Group 
establishes in its processes. In this respect, Internal Audit 
functionally depends on the Audit and Control 
Committee and becomes an area independent from the 
Company management which supports this Committee 
in its competencies on assurance, risk management and 
the internal control system, applying a systematic and 
disciplined approach, through the means indicated above 
in 4.7.1. 
The Internal Audit function is developed in accordance 
with the International Standards for the Professional 
Practice of Internal Auditing and, in this regard, it has 
been awarded a Quality Certificate from the International 
Institute of Internal Auditors. 
With regard to the supervision of the Internal Control 
System Over Financial Reporting (ICFR), Telefónica, S.A., 
as company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is 
subject to the regulatory requirements established by the 
North American regulatory bodies that regulate 
companies listed on that Stock Exchange. Among those 
requirements is the aforementioned Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 
of 2002, and, specifically, Section 404 of that Act, which 
stipulates the need for companies listed in the US market 
to assess on an annual basis the effectiveness of the 
procedures and structures of the internal control over 
financial reporting (ICFR). In order to comply with this 
requirement, and as stated above, the Telefónica Group 
has a Methodology of the system for the internal control 
over Financial Reporting (ICFR), Internal Audit is the area 
in charge of performing, on an annual basis, the 
assessment on its effectiveness as of the year-end date, 
with a reasonable assurance approach, in accordance 
with the guidelines established by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO) in its Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
report of 2013.
Additionally, and also in accordance with what is 
established in Section 404 of this Act, the External 
Auditor issues their own independent opinion of 
reasonable assurance on the effectiveness of the Internal 
Control System over Financial Reporting (ICFR), in 
accordance with the criteria established in Internal 
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO”).  
Review on specific processes and controls

in scope. For this purpose, the Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting System Audit Methodology is applied, 
which is aligned with the guidelines established by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) in its Internal Control – Integrated 
Framework report.
As indicated above, the “Scope Definition Model” is 
available, which is based both on the principle of relative 
importance(materiality) and on the assessment of risks 
related to the financial reporting processes of the 
Telefónica Group. Based on the application of this model, 
the identification of the relevant financial accounting by 
company of the consolidation perimeter is carried out. 
Once the accounts and companies are identified having 
identified within the scope of the evaluation, the Internal 
Control System Auditing Methodology on the Group’s 
Financial Information is applied as follows: 
• Identify economic-financial processes associated with 
the significant accounts so that a reasonable coverage 
is achieved in the evaluation of the ICFR of the Group, 
considered as a whole.
• As part of the scope definition procedures, Information 
Technology (IT) systems and tools and technological 
infrastructures associated with these economic-
financial processes in scope (technological processes) 
are also identified. Additionally, as part of the risk 
assessment and the previous procedures, those 
aspects of cybersecurity that could have a relevant 
impact on the ICFR are also considered for the 
purposes of concluding on their inclusion in the scope 
of the Evaluation of the effectiveness of the ICFR of the 
Group, considered as a whole.
• Identify significant risks and high inherent risks 
regarding financial reporting associated to those 
processes. 
• Carry out Walkthroughs of the economic-financial 
processes and technological processes in the scope of 
the evaluation, considerations of transactions carried 
out, which allows  the design of the controls associated 
with these processes, and identifying the key controls 
that address the specific risks and the financial 
assumptions associated with these processes. 
• Additionally, assess the operability of the previously 
qualified key controls, by applying the corresponding 
evaluation tests and its design assessed as effective. 
For this purpose, the corresponding assessment tests 
are applied, based on the nature, timing and scope that 
determine both the periodicity and the risk rating of the 
key control.
• In the event that control deficiencies and/or 
opportunities for improvement are identified during the 
Internal Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) 
assessment procedures, they are reported to 
Management through the corresponding conclusions 
reported by Internal Audit, prior analysis of their impact, 
both at individual and aggregate level, on the 
evaluation of the Internal Control System for Financial 
Information (ICFR) of the Telefónica Group. For the 
purposes of this assessment, the existing compensating 
controls are taken into consideration, which mitigate 
the risks that the deficiencies identified could not be 
remedied at year-end.
• Where appropriate, execute the necessary audit 
procedures related to those investigations of facts 
reported through the Internal Information System, in 
which there may be effects on the correct design or 
operability of internal control.
• Internal Audit communicates to both Management and 
the Audit and Control Committee any significant 
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the internal 
control system over financial reporting (ICFR) identified, 
if applicable, as a result of its evaluation of internal 
control over the financial report, as well as the design 
and status of the implementation of the corresponding 
action plans, which are subject to periodic monitoring 
by the Audit and Control Committee.
Review on IT general controls 
The Information Technology General Controls (ITGCs) of 
IT Systems (IT applications and Systems), which support 
the financial and economic processes in the assessment 
scope of the internal control over financial reporting 
(ICFR), are evaluated at least annually, also on the basis of 
the above-mentioned evaluation methodology.
The review on IT general controls over IT systems and 
tools and the technological infrastructures (databases 
and operating systems), has the objective to assess the 
effectiveness of the design and operability of key controls 
related to (i) managing changes to programs, which 
includes the authorization of the changes implemented at 
the production stage and that must be supported by their 
corresponding user tests (UATs), ensuring an adequate 
segregation of duties and environments, such as (ii) 
logical access,  which includes the control on credentials 
and profiles, as well as the segregation of duties and the 
monitoring of activities that are critical in information 
systems and tools and in the technological infrastructures 
that supports them (databases and  operating systems), 
and (iii) other IT general controls which support the 
correct operation of information systems and tools 
(managing changes to infrastructures, back-ups, 
managing security patches and programmed tasks and 
their monitoring as well as the activities of managing 
gaps). Additionally, appropriate audit testing of internal 
control over cybersecurity aspects included within the 
scope of the Assessment of the effectiveness of the 
Group's ICFR. 
Self-assessment Questionnaires 
In addition, all the companies that depend from the 
Group which are not within the direct scope of the

receive annually internal control self-assessment 
questionnaires, whose answers must be subsequently 
certified by the local persons responsible of their ICFR in 
each Company (Executive Presidents and/or Finance 
Directors, or functional positions). These questionnaires 
address aspects of internal control over financial 
reporting (ICFR) that are considered minimum 
requirements in order to achieve a reasonable assurance 
of the reliability of the financial information reported. The 
answers are demonstrably audited by the corresponding 
Internal Audit Units. 
Weakness detection and management procedure 
As previously stated, the Internal Audit area is also in 
charge, among other functions, to provide support to the 
Audit and Control Committee in the supervision of the 
functioning of the system for the internal control over 
financial reporting (ICFR). 
The Internal Audit department participates in the Audit 
and Control Committee meetings and informs regularly 
about the conclusions of the carried out works, and also 
informs about the action plans designed and agreed for 
mitigation and about the degree of implementation 
thereof. This includes, where applicable, to communicate 
internal control significant deficiencies and material 
weaknesses which may have been identified in the 
process for ICFR assessment, as well as the follow-up on 
the implementation of action plans related to significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
On the other hand, the Accounts Auditor also participates 
in the Audit and Control Committee, at the request of the 
Audit and Control Committee, in order to explain and 
clarify aspects of their audit reports and the rest of work 
carried out by the External Auditor, which including work 
carried out to audit the effectiveness of the internal 
control over Group's financial reporting. As well as 
Internal Audit, the External Auditor is obliged to 
communicate the significant deficiencies or material 
weaknesses identified in the development of their 
integrated audit, which includes the audit of the Internal 
Control System over Financial Information (ICFR)  on the 
system for the internal control over financial reporting 
(ICFR). For this purpose, the Accounts Auditor has direct 
access at all times to Senior Management and the 
Chairman of the Audit and Control Committee, and, in 
parallel with the Internal Auditing, it also reports 
independently to that Committee the results of both the 
preliminary and final phase of their audit on the ICFR. 
Action plans
In the event that control deficiencies and/or opportunities 
for improvement are detected as a result of the 
assessment of the Telefónica Group’s Internal Control 
System for Financial Information (SCIIF), depending on 
the scope established, the control owners communicate 
their action plans agreed for solving the identified control 
deficiencies and/or improvement opportunities, as well as 
the deadlines scheduled for their implementation. These 
action plans have as fundamental objectives: 
• To remedy the control deficiencies identified in the 
ICFR annual assessment, so that the control activities 
are designed and operate in an effective manner, or 
failing that, the risk generated is substantially mitigated. 
• To prioritize the implementation of improvement 
opportunities in the efficiency of processes; 
improvement opportunities are defined as such, since 
they do not constitute internal control deficiencies. 
Conclusion of the assessment of the Internal 
Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) as 
of December 31, 2024.
Internal Audit has carried out its assessment of the 
effectiveness of the Internal Control System for Financial 
Information (ICFR) as of December 31, 2024. To perform 
this assessment, the guidelines established by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) in its “Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework of 2013” report, were considered. Based on 
the assessment carried out, it was concluded that, as of 
December 31, 2024, the Telefónica Group’s Internal 
Control System for Financial Information (ICFR) was 
effective in accordance with these guidelines.
4.7.6. External Auditor's Report 
As indicated above, the Group was commissioned to the 
External Auditor, both to perform a reasonable assurance 
audit the effectiveness of the internal control system over 
financial reporting (ICFR) in accordance with the criteria 
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework  of 
2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), 
and to review the description of the ICFR of the

Independent reasonable assurance report on the design and effectiveness
of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)

To the board of directors of Telefonica, S.A.

We have carried out a reasonable assurance engagement of the design and effectiveness of Internal
Control over Financial Reporting (hereinafter, CFR) and the accompanying description thereof included in
section 4.7 of the Annual Corporate Governance Report of Telefonica, S.A. (the Company) as at December
31, 2024. This internal control system is based on the criteria and policies defined by Telefonica, S.A. in
accordance with the guidelines established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO) in its “Internal Control-Integrated Framework’ report, in its most recent framework
published in 2013.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance on the
reliability of financial information in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) permit the maintenance, in reasonable detail, of records that
accurately reflect the transactions that have taken place; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that the
transactions are appropriately recorded to permit the preparation of financial information, in accordance with
the applicable financial reporting framework, and that these transactions only take place pursuant to the
pertinent authorisation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance in relation to the prevention or timely
detection of unauthorised acquisitions, use or disposal of assets which could have a material effect on the
financial information.

Inherent limitations

In this regard, it should be borne in mind that, given the inherent limitations of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, regardless of the quality of its design and operation, such internal control system only permits
the provision of reasonable, but not absolute, assurance in relation to the objectives pursued, such that
errors, irregularities or fraud may occur which may not be detected. In addition, projections of the evaluation
of internal control to future periods are subject to risks such as that internal control may become inadequate
as a result of future changes in applicable conditions, or that in the future, the degree of compliance with
established policies or procedures may be reduced.

Directors’ responsibility

The directors of Telefonica, S.A. are responsible for adopting the necessary measures to reasonably ensure
the implementation, maintenance and supervision of appropriate Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
as well as for the evaluation of its effectiveness, the development of improvements to that system and for
the preparation and establishment of the content of the accompanying information relating to ICFR.

Our responsibility

Our responsibility is to issue a reasonable assurance report on the design and effectiveness of Telefonica,
S.A.‘s Internal Control over Financial Reporting, based on the work we have performed and on the
evidence we have obtained. We conducted our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) (Revised), “Assurance Engagements
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and
Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).

Telefonica, S.A.

A reasonable assurance engagement includes understanding Internal Control over Financial Reporting,
assessing the risk that material weaknesses in internal control may exist, that controls are not properly
designed or do not operate effectively, the execution of tests and evaluations of the design and effective
application of the aforementioned internal control system, based on our professional judgement, and the
performance of such other procedures as may be deemed necessary.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

Our independence and quality Management

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics
for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design,
implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding
compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.

Opinion

In our opinion, Telefonica, S.A. maintained, as at December 31, 2024, in all material respects, effective
Internal Control over Financial Reporting for the financial year ended December 31, 2024, which is based
on the criteria and policies defined by Telefonica, S.A.’s management in accordance with the guidelines
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its
“Internal Control-Integrated Framework” report in its most recent framework published in 2013.

Similarly, the accompanying description of ICFR included in section 4.7 of the Annual Corporate
Governance Report of Telefonica, S.A. as at December 31, 2024 has been prepared, in all material
respects, in accordance with the requirements established by article 540 of the consolidated text of the
Companies Act and Circular 5/2013 of June 12, 2013 of the Comisién Nacional del Mercado de Valores
(CNMV), and subsequent amendments, the most recent being Circular 3/2021, of September 28 of the
CNMV, for the purposes of the description of ICFR in Annual Corporate Governance Reports.

Our work does not constitute an audit nor is it subject to the regulations governing the audit activity in force
in Spain, and as a result we do not express an audit opinion in the terms provided in the aforementioned
regulations.

Detail the procedure                                                           
The Company adopts the necessary measures, 
whenever possible, that the Directors receive the 
necessary information, specially drawn up and geared to 
preparing the meetings of the Board and its Committees, 
sufficiently in advance. Under no circumstances shall 
such a requirement not be fulfilled, on the grounds of the 
importance or the confidential nature of the information, 
part from absolutely exceptional cases. 
In this regard, and in accordance with Articles 18 and 20 
of the Regulation of the Board of Directors, at the 
beginning of each year the Board of Directors and its 
Committees set the calendar of ordinary meetings to be 
held during the year. The calendar may be amended by 
resolution of the Board itself, or by decision of the 
Chairman, in which case the Directors shall be made 
aware of the amendment as soon as practicable. 
Likewise, the Regulations of the Audit and Control 
Committee and the Regulations of the Nominating, 
Compensation and Good Governance Committee detail 
the operating regime of these Committees. 
Also, the Board and its Committees shall prepare an 
Action Plan detailing the actions to be carried out and          
their timing for each year, as per their assigned powers 
and duties. 
Likewise, all the meetings of the Board and the Board 
Committees have a pre-established agenda, which is 
communicated at least three days prior to the date 
scheduled for the meeting together with the call for the 
session. The Agenda for each meeting will clearly state 
points on which the Board of Directors, or the Executive 
Committee, have to adopt a decision or resolution.

For the same purpose, in general, the Directors are sent 
the documentation related to the agenda of the 
meetings sufficiently in advance. In accordance with 
Article 19 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, 
the Chairman of the Board of Directors organizes the 
debates, promoting and encouraging all Directors to play 
an active role in the deliberations, safeguarding their 
right to freely adopt their own position on all matters. 
Moreover, with the assistance of the Secretary, he shall 
ensure that the Directors are sent sufficient information 
to discuss the points set out in the agenda sufficiently in 
advance of the meeting. He also ensures that sufficient 
time is given over to discussing strategic matters, and 
shall encourage debate during meetings, safeguarding 
the Directors' right to adopt their positions freely on all 
points discussed. 
To provide all the information and clarifications 
necessary in relation to certain points deliberated, the 
Group’s senior executive officers attend nearly all the 
Board and Committee meetings to explain the matters 
within their powers. 
Furthermore, and as a general rule, the Regulations of 
the Board of Directors (Article 25) expressly establish 
that Directors are granted the broadest powers to obtain 
information about all aspects of the Company, to 
examine its books, records, documents and other data 
regarding corporate transactions. Exercising of this right 
to receive information shall be channelled through the 
Chairman or Secretary to the Board of Directors, who 
shall respond to the requests made by the Directors, 
providing them with the requested information directly 
or offering them the proper contacts at the appropriate 
level of the organization. 
C.1.39 Identify individually as regards directors, and 
in aggregate form in other cases, and provide 
details of any agreements between the company 
and its directors, executives or employees 
containing indemnity or golden parachute clauses

economic compensation for the termination of the 
employment relationship, where applicable, that can 
amount to four years' of remuneration at the most. 
Annual remuneration on which the indemnity is based is 
the last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of 
the last two variable remuneration payments received by 
contract.  
Regarding the contracts of members of Senior 
Executives, in general, they are contractually entitled the 
right to receive the economic compensation indicated 
below in the event that their employment relationship is 
ended for reasons attributable to the Company or, in 
some instances, is due to objective reasons such as a 
change of control in the Company. However, if the 
employment relationship is terminated because of a 
breach attributable to the Executive, he/she will not be 
entitled to any compensation whatsoever. That 
notwithstanding, in certain cases the severance benefit 
to be received by the member of Senior Management 
according to their contract is not calculated as per these 
general criteria, but rather is based on other 
circumstances of a personal or professional nature or on 
the time when the contract was signed. The agreed 
economic compensation for the termination of the 
employment relationship, where applicable, consists of a 
maximum of three times annual remuneration plus 
another year based on length of service at the Company. 
Annual remuneration on which the indemnity is based is 
the last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of 
the last two variable remuneration payments received by 
contract. 
Meanwhile, contracts that tie employees to the 
Company under a common employment relationship do 
not include indemnity clauses for the termination of their 
employment. In these cases, the employee is entitled to 
any indemnity set forth in prevailing labor legislation. 
However, contracts of some company employees, 
depending on their level and seniority, as well as their 
personal or professional circumstances or when they 
signed their contracts, establish their right to receive 
compensation in the same cases as in the preceding 
paragraph, generally consisting of a year and a half 
salary. The annual salary on which the indemnity is 
based is the last fixed salary and the average amount of 
the last two variable payments received by contract. 
Indicate whether, beyond the cases established by 
legislation, these agreements have to be 
communicated and/or authorised by the governing 
bodies of the company or its group. If so, specify 
the procedures, the cases concerned and the 
nature of the bodies responsible for their approval 
or communication:

G. Degree of Compliance with 
Corporate Governance 
Recommendations
Specify the Company’s degree of compliance 
with recommendations of the Good Governance 
Code for listed companies.  
In the event that a recommendation is not 
followed or only partially followed, a detailed 
explanation of the reasons must be included so 
that shareholders, investors and the market in 
general have enough information to assess the 
company´s conduct. General explanations are 
not acceptable.  
1. That the Articles of Association of listed 
companies should not limit the maximum number 
of votes that may be cast by one shareholder or 
contain other restrictions that hinder the 
takeover of control of the company through the 
acquisition of its shares on the market.  
Explain 
In accordance with Article 26 of the Corporate Bylaws, 
no shareholder may cast a number of votes in excess 
of 10% of the total voting capital existing at any time, 
regardless of the number of shares held by such 
shareholder and in full compliance with mandatory 
requirements of law. In determining the maximum 
number of votes that each shareholder may cast, only 
the shares held by each such shareholder shall be 
computed. It does not include additional votes cast on 
behalf of other shareholders who may have appointed 
them as proxy, who are themselves likewise restricted 
by the 10% voting ceiling. 
The limitation established in the preceding 
paragraphs shall also apply to the maximum number 
of votes that may be collectively or individually cast by 
two or more shareholder companies belonging to the 
same group of entities, as well as to the maximum 
number of votes that may be cast by an individual or 
corporate shareholder and the entity or entities that 
are shareholders themselves and which are directly or 
indirectly controlled by such individual or corporate 
shareholder. 
In addition, Article 30 of the Corporate Bylaws 
stipulates that no person may be appointed as 
Director unless they have held, for more than three 
years prior to their appointment, a number of shares of 
the Company representing a nominal value of at least 
3,000 euros, which the Director may not transfer 
while in office. These requirements shall not apply to 
those persons who, at the time of their appointment, 
are related to the Company under an employment or 
professional relationship, or when the Board of 
Directors resolves to waive such requirements with 
the favorable vote of at least 85 percent of its 
members. 
Article 31 of the Corporate Bylaws establishes that, in 
order for a Director to be appointed Chairman, Vice-
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or member of the 
Executive Commission, it shall be necessary for such 
Director to have served on the Board for at least the 
three years immediately prior to any such 
appointment. However, such length of service shall 
not be required if the appointment is made with the 
favorable vote of at least 85 percent of the members 
of the Board of Directors. 
The Corporate Bylaws (Article 26) restrict the number 
of shares that may be cast by a single shareholder or 
by shareholders belonging to the same group in order 
to achieve a suitable balance and protect the position 
of minority shareholders, thus avoiding a potential 
concentration of votes among a reduced number of 
shareholders, which could impact on the guiding 
principle that the General Shareholders’ Meeting must 
act in the social interest and interest of all the 
shareholders. Telefónica believes that this measure 
does not constitute a blocking mechanism of takeover 
bids but rather a guarantee that the acquisition of 
control required the sufficient support of all 
shareholders, because, naturally, and as taught by 
experience, potential offerors may make their offer 
conditional upon the removal of this requirement.
In relation to the above and in accordance with the 
provisions of Article 527 of the Spanish Companies 
Act, any clauses in the Bylaws of listed corporations 
that directly or indirectly restrict the number of shares 
that may be cast by a single shareholder by 
shareholders belonging to the same group or by any 
parties acting together with the aforementioned, will 
rendered null and void when, subsequent to a 
takeover bid, the offeror has a stake equal to or over 
70% of the share capital which confers voting rights, 
unless the offeror was not subject to neutralization 
measures to prevent a takeover bid or had not 
adapted these measures accordingly. 
In addition, the special requirements for appointment 
as Director (Article 30 of the Corporate Bylaws) or as 
Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Chief Operating Officer or 
member of the Executive Commission (Article 31 of 
the Corporate Bylaws) are justified by the desire that 
access to the management decision-making body and 
to the most significant positions thereon is reserved to 
persons who have demonstrated their commitment to 
the Company and who, in addition, have adequate 
experience as members of the Board, such that 
continuity of the management model adopted by the 
Telefónica Group may be assured in the interest of all 
of its shareholders and stakeholders. In any event,

Complies 
5. That the Board of Directors should not submit

8. That the audit committee should ensure that 
the financial statements submitted to the 
General Shareholders' Meeting are prepared in 
accordance with accounting regulations. And 
that in cases in which the auditor has included a 
qualification or reservation in its audit report, the 
chairman of the audit committee should clearly 
explain to the general meeting the opinion of the 
audit committee on its content and scope,

Complies  
9. That the company should permanently publish 
on its website the requirements and procedures 
for certification of share ownership, the right of 
attendance at the General Shareholders’ 
Meetings, and the exercise of the right to vote or 
to issue a proxy.

Complies

and sustainable business in the long term, 
promoting its continuity and maximising the 
economic value of the business.  
And that in pursuit of the company’s interest, in 
addition to complying with applicable law and     
rules and conducting itself on the basis of good 
faith, ethics and a respect for commonly 
accepted best practices, it should seek to 
reconcile its own company interests, when

it operates and on the environment.

b) Ensures that proposals for appointment or re-
election are based upon a prior analysis of the 
skills required by the Board of Directors; and  
c) Favours diversity of knowledge, experience, 
age and gender. For these purposes, it is 
considered that the measures that encourage 
the company to have a significant number of 
female senior executives favour gender 
diversity.

required by the Board of Directors be contained 
in the supporting report from the nomination 
committee published upon calling the General 
Shareholders’ Meeting to which the ratification,

appointment or re-election of each director is 
submitted. 
The nomination committee will annually verify 
compliance with this policy and explain its 
findings in the annual corporate governance 
report. 
Complies  
15. That proprietary and independent directors 
should constitute a substantial majority of the 
Board of Directors and that the number of 
executive directors be kept to a minimum, taking 
into account the complexity of the corporate 
group and the percentage of equity participation 
of executive directors.  
And that the number of female directors should 
represent at least 40% of the members of the 
Board of Directors before the end of 2022 and 
thereafter, and no less than 30% prior to that 
date.
Partially complies
The Company complies with the first part of the 
recommendation. On the other hand, regarding the 
number of female directors, until May 2024, as a result 
of the voluntary resignation submitted by Ms. Carmen 
García de Andrés as an Independent Director, the 
Company complied with the recommendation that 
the number of female directors should represent at 
least 40% of the members of the Board of Directors. 
Although currently the number of female directors 
represents 35.71%, the Company maintains its 
commitment to diversity and equal opportunities. All 
measures and processes adopted and agreed upon by 
the Board of Directors and the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee to facilitate the inclusion of a number of 
women on the Board that allows for a balanced 
presence of women and men, and to avoid selection 
procedures suffering from implicit biases that hinder 
the appointment of female directors, have been 
undertaken and carried out by the Company. To 
continue advancing in this area, the Nominating, 
Compensation and Corporate Governance 
Committee evaluates profiles to fill new vacancies on 
the Board of Directors in accordance with the 
Diversity Policy in relation to the Board of Directors of 
Telefónica, S.A. and the Selection of Directors, 
promoting gender diversity, experiences, and 
knowledge, without suffering from implicit biases that 
may imply any discrimination. In conclusion, the 
process of renewing the Company's Board of 
Directors has been designed and is being 
progressively implemented to ensure continuity in the 
management model of the Telefónica Group. In this 
regard, in the selection of new candidates to fill the 
vacancies that arise, the Company will continue to 
seek women who meet the required professional 
profile to thus increase gender diversity on the Board 
of Directors.
16. That the number of proprietary directors as a 
percentage of the total number of non-executive 
director not be greater than the proportion of 
the company's share capital represented by 
those directors and the rest of the capital.  
  This criterion may be relaxed:  
a) In large-cap companies where very few   
shareholdings are legally considered 
significant.  
b) In the case of companies where a plurality of 
shareholders is represented on the Board of 
Directors without ties among them.  
Complies
17. That the number of independent directors 
should represent at least half of the total number 
of directors.  
That, however, when the company does not have 
a high level of market capitalisation or in the 
event that it is a large-cap company with one 
shareholder or a group of shareholders acting in 
a concert who together control more than 30% 
of the company’s share capital, the number of 
independent directors should represent at least 
one third of the total number of directors.  
Complies 
18. That companies should publish the following 
information on its directors on their website, and 
keep it up to date:  
a) Professional profile and biography.  
b) Any other Boards to which the directors 
belong, regardless of whether or not the 
companies are listed, as well as any other 
remunerated activities engaged in, regardless 
of type.  
c) Category of directorship, indicating, in the 
case of individuals who represent significant 
shareholders, the shareholder that they 
represent or to which they are connected.  
d) Date of their first appointment as a director of 
the company’s Board of Directors, and any 
subsequent re-elections.  
e) Company shares and share options that they 
own.

Complies 
19. That the annual corporate governance report, 
after verification by the nomination committee, 
should explain the reasons for the appointment 
of any proprietary directors at the proposal of 
the shareholders whose holding is less than 3%. 
It should also explain, if applicable, why formal 
requests from shareholders for presence on the 
Board were not honoured, when their 
shareholding was equal to or exceeded that of 
other shareholders whose proposal for 
proprietary directors was honoured.  
Not applicable  
20. That proprietary directors representing 
significant shareholders should resign from the 
Board when the shareholder they represent 
disposes of its entire shareholding. They should 
also resign, in a proportional fashion, in the event 
that said shareholder reduces its percentage 
interest to a level that requires a decrease in the 
number of proprietary directors.  
Not applicable  
21. That the Board of Directors should not 
propose the dismissal of any independent 
director before the completion of the director’s 
term provided for in the articles of incorporation 
unless the Board of Directors finds just cause 
and a prior report has been prepared by the 
nomination committee. Specifically, just cause is 
considered to exist if the director takes on new 
duties or commits to new obligations that would 
interfere with his or her ability to dedicate the 
time necessary for attention to the duties 
inherent to his or her post as a director, fails to 
complete the tasks inherent to his or her post, or 
is affected by any of the circumstances which 
would cause the loss of independent status in 
accordance with applicable law.  
The dismissal of independent directors may also 
be proposed as a result of a public takeover bid, 
merger or other similar corporate transaction 
entailing a change in the shareholder structure 
of the company, provided that such changes in 
the structure of the board are the result of the 
proportionate representation criterion provided 
in Recommendation 16.  
Complies 
22. That companies should establish rules 
requiring that directors inform the Board of 
Directors and, when circumstances arise which 
affect them, whether or not related to their 
actions in the company itself, and which may 
harm the company's standing and reputation, 
and in particular requiring them to inform the 
Board of any criminal proceedings in which they 
appear as suspects or defendants, as well as of 
how the legal proceedings subsequently unfold.
And that, if the Board is informed or becomes 
aware in any other manner of any of the 
circumstances mentioned above, it must 
investigate the case as quickly as possible and, 
depending on the specific circumstances, 
decide, based on a report from the nomination 
and remuneration committee, whether or not any 
measure may be adopted, such as the opening of 
an internal investigation, asking the director to 
resign or proposing that he or she be dismissed. 
And that these events must be reported in the 
annual corporate governance report, unless 
there are any special reasons not to do so, which 
must also be noted in the minutes. This without 
prejudice to the information that the company 
must disseminate, if appropriate, at the time 
when the corresponding measures are 
implemented. 
Complies 
23. That all directors clearly express their 
opposition when they consider any proposal 
submitted to the Board of Directors to be against 
the company’s interests. This particularly applies 
to independent directors and directors who are 
unaffected by a potential conflict of interest if 
the decision could be detrimental to any 
shareholders not represented on the Board of 
Directors.  
Furthermore, when the Board of Directors makes 
significant or repeated decisions about which 
the director has serious reservations, the 
director should draw the appropriate conclusions 
and, in the event the director decides to resign, 
explain the reasons for this decision in the letter 
referred to in the next recommendation.  
This recommendation also applies to the 
secretary of the Board of Directors, even if he or 
she is not a director.  
Not applicable
24. That whenever, due to resignation or 
resolution of the General Shareholders' Meeting, 
a director leaves before the completion of his or 
her term in office, the director should explain the 
reasons for this decision, or in the case of non-
executive directors, their opinion of the reasons 
for cessation, in a letter addressed to all 
members of the Board of Directors.

And that, without prejudice to all this being 
reported in the annual corporate governance 
report, insofar as it is relevant for investors, the 
company must publish the cessation as quickly 
as possible, adequately referring to the reasons 
or circumstances adduced by the director. 
Complies 
25. That the nomination committee should make 
sure that non-executive directors have sufficient 
time available in order to properly perform their 
duties.  
And that the Board regulations establish the 
maximum number of company Boards on which 
directors may sit.  
Complies  
26. That the Board of Directors meet frequently 
enough so be able to effectively perform its 
duties, and at least eight times per year, 
following a schedule of dates and agenda 
established at the beginning of the year and 
allowing each director individually to propose 
items that do not originally appear on the 
agenda.  
Complies 
27. That director absences occur only when 
absolutely necessary and be quantified in the 
annual corporate governance report. And when 
absences do occur, that the director appoint a 
proxy with instructions.  
Complies  
28. That when directors or the secretary express 
concern regarding a proposal or, in the case of 
directors, regarding the direction in which the 
company is headed and said concerns are not 
resolved by the Board of Directors, such 
concerns should be included in the minutes at 
the request of the director expressing them.  
Not applicable
29. That the company should establish adequate 
means for directors to obtain appropriate advice 
in order to properly fulfill their duties including, 
should circumstances warrant, external advice at 
the company’s expense.  
Complies  
30. That, without regard to the knowledge 
necessary for directors to complete their duties, 
companies make refresher courses available to 
them when circumstances make this advisable.
Complies 
31. That the agenda for meetings should clearly 
indicate those matters on which the Board of 
Directors is to make a decision or adopt a 
resolution so that the directors may study or 
gather all relevant information ahead of time.  
When, in exceptional circumstances, the 
chairman wishes to bring urgent matters for 
decision or resolution before the Board of 
Directors which do not appear on the agenda, 
prior express agreement of a majority of the 
directors shall be necessary, and said consent 
shall be duly recorded in the minutes.  
Complies 
32. That directors be periodically informed of 
changes in shareholding and of the opinions of 
significant shareholders, investors and rating 
agencies of the company and its group.  
Complies  
33. That the chairman, as the person responsible 
for the efficient workings of the Board of 
Directors, in addition to carrying out the duties 
assigned by law and the articles of incorporation, 
should prepare and submit to the Board of 
Directors a schedule of dates and matters to be 
considered; organise and coordinate the periodic 
evaluation of the Board as well as, if applicable, 
the chief executive of the company, should be 
responsible for leading the Board and the 
effectiveness of its work; ensuring that sufficient 
time is devoted to considering strategic issues, 
and approve and supervise refresher courses for 
each director when circumstances make this 
advisable.  
Complies 
34. That when there is a coordinating director, 
the articles of incorporation or Board regulations 
should confer upon him the following powers in 
addition to those conferred by law: to chair the 
Board of Directors in the absence of the 
chairman and deputy chairmen, should there be 
any; to reflect the concerns of non-executive 
directors; to liaise with investors and 
shareholders in order to understand their points 
of view and respond to their concerns, in 
particular as those concerns relate to corporate 
governance of the company; and to coordinate a 
succession plan for the chairman.

Complies 
35. That the secretary of the Board of Directors

activities and decisions of the Board of Directors 
take into account such recommendations 
regarding good governance contained in this 
Good Governance Code as may be applicable to 
the company.  
Complies 
36. That the Board of Directors meet in plenary

the Board, a report from the nomination 
committee.  
Every three years, the Board of Directors will 
rely for its evaluation upon the assistance of 
an external advisor, whose independence shall 
be verified by the nomination committee.  
Business relationships between the external 
adviser or any member of the adviser’s group 
and the company or any company within its 
group must be specified in the annual 
corporate governance report.  
The process and the areas evaluated must be 
described in the annual corporate governance 
report.  
Complies
37. That if there is an executive committee, there 
should be at least two non-executive directors, 
at least one of whom should be independent, and

Board. 
Complies 
38. That the Board of Directors must always be

information and internal control systems operate 
correctly, and which reports to the non-
executive chairman of the Board or of the audit 
committee.  
Complies 
41. That the person in charge of the unit 
performing the internal audit function should

draw up a prior report to the Board of Directors 
on the economic conditions and accounting 
implications and, in particular, any exchange 
ratio involved.  
Complies 
45. That the risk management and control policy

be acceptable. 
d) Measures in place to mitigate the impact of 
the risks identified in the event that they

Complies 
46. That under the direct supervision of the audit 
committee or, if applicable, of a specialised 
committee of the Board of Directors, an internal 
risk control and management function should 
exist, performed by an internal unit or 
department of the company which is expressly 
charged with the following responsibilities:  
a) Ensuring the proper functioning of risk 
management and control systems and, in 
particular, that they adequately identify, 
manage and quantify all material risks 
affecting the company.  
b) Actively participating in drawing up the risk 
strategy and in important decisions regarding 
risk management.
c) Ensuring that the risk management and 
control systems adequately mitigate risks as 
defined by the policy laid down by the Board 
of Directors.  
Complies
47. That in designating the members of the 
nomination and remuneration committee - or of 
the nomination committee and the remuneration 
committee if they are separate - care be taken to 
ensure that they have the knowledge, aptitudes 
and experience appropriate to the functions that 
they are called upon to perform and that the 
majority of said members are independent 
directors.  
Complies 
48. That large-cap companies have separate 
nomination and remuneration committees.  
Explain 
Article 40 of the Bylaws and Article 23 of the 
Regulation of the Board of Directors expressly state 
on regulating the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committees, that the Board of 
Directors shall be entitled to set up two Committees, 
separately giving each of them powers for 
appointments, and the other the powers for 
remuneration, while the corporate governance 
powers may be included in either one of them.  
The Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. has not 
considered appropriate, so far, separating the 
functions of the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee because it 
believes that by putting the powers to assess 
Directors and determine their remuneration in the 
same Committee, is helpful to coordinate and to 
produce a results-driven remuneration system (pay for 
performance). The Board also considers that the 
workload of the Nominating, Compensation and 
Corporate Governance Committee and, therefore, its 
members, is reasonable and does not make it 
advisable, for the time being, to divide it into two 
separate committees. 
49. That the nomination committee consult with 
the chairman of the Board of Directors and the 
chief executive of the company, especially in 
relation to matters concerning executive 
directors.  
And that any director be able to ask the 
nomination committee to consider potential 
candidates that he or she considers suitable to 
fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors.  
Complies 
50. That the remuneration committee exercise 
its functions independently and that, in addition 
to the functions assigned to it by law, it should 
be responsible for the following:  
a) Proposing the basic conditions of employment 
for senior management to the Board of 
Directors. 
b) Verifying compliance with company's 
remuneration policy.  
c) Periodically reviewing the remuneration policy 
applied to directors and senior managers, 
including share-based remuneration systems 
and their application, as well as ensuring that 
their individual remuneration is proportional to 
that received by the company's other 
directors and senior managers.  
d) Making sure that potential conflicts of interest 
do not undermine the independence of 
external advice given to the board.  
e) Verifying the information on remuneration of 
directors and senior managers contained in 
the various corporate documents, including 
the annual report on director remuneration.  
Complies
51. That the remuneration committee should 
consult with the chairman and the chief 
executive of the company, especially in matters 
relating to executive directors and senior 
management.

52. That the rules regarding the composition and 
workings of the supervision and control 
committees should appear in the regulations of 
the Board of Directors and that they should be 
consistent with those applying to legally 
mandatory committees in accordance with the 
foregoing recommendations, including:  
a) That they be composed exclusively of non-
executive directors, with a majority of 
independent directors.  
b) That their chairpersons be independent 
directors.  
c) That the Board of Directors select members of 
these committees taking into account their 
knowledge, skills and experience and the 
duties of each committee; discuss their 
proposals and reports; and require them to 
render account of their activities and of the 
work performed in the first plenary session of 
the Board of Directors held after each 
committee meeting.  
d) That the committees be allowed to avail 
themselves of outside advice when they 
consider it necessary to perform their duties.  
e) That their meetings be recorded and the 
minutes be made available to all directors.  
Explain  
1. The supervision and control committees which are 
attributed the powers referred to in recommendation 
52 are the Audit and Control Committee and the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee. The composition and 
operation rules of the two Committees are set out in 
the Regulation of the Board of Directors and in the 
specific Regulations of each one of them. Likewise, 
both Committees are not only consistent with legally 
dispositions applicable but are also an improvement 
upon them, in certain areas. For example, according to 
the Regulation of the Board of Directors, the 
Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee must have a majority of 
independent members, as opposed to the minimum of 
two according to prevailing laws. In fact, in practice, 
the Committee is composed of three Independent 
Directors and one with the category of "Other 
External". 
Additionally, the Regulations of the Board of Directors 
establish that the Audit and Control Committee must 
have a majority of independent directors, also 
exceeding the minimum of two required by law. In 
practice, this Committee is composed of three 
Independent Directors and one with the category of 
"Proprietary".
2. The Board of Directors has a Consulting Committee 
(Sustainability and Regulation Committee) which has 
other functions strongly linked with the businesses 
developed by the Company and with management 
aspects. The mentioned Committee has some of the 
functions set out in Recommendations 53 and 54 
below.   
The Sustainability and Regulation Committee is 
expressly regulated in the Regulation of the Board of 
Directors, although with fewer details with respect to 
those that are legally mandatory.  However, this non-
mandatory committee is, in practice, subject to the 
operating rules set out in Recommendation 52 a), c), 
d) and e).
It has been considered that the Sustainability and 
Regulation Committee with powers in matters linked 
to the Company's businesses and management 
aspects do not necessarily have to be chaired by 
Independent Directors but rather it is preferable to 
take into account the technical knowledge and 
specific expertise of their members when appointing 
the Director to chair them who should sit on these 
committees. 
It should also be noted that all Board Committees are 
composed of a majority of independent Directors. 
53. That verification of compliance with the 
company's policies and rules on environmental, 
social and corporate governance matters, and 
with the internal codes of conduct be assigned 
to one or divided among more than one 
committee of the Board of Directors, in the 
exercise of its power of self-organisation, may 
have decided to create. And that such 
committee be composed exclusively of non-
executive directors, with a majority of these 
being independent directors, and that the 
minimum functions indicated in the next 
recommendation be specifically assigned to it.
Complies 
54. The minimum functions referred to in the 
foregoing recommendation are the following:
a) Monitoring of compliance with the company’s 
internal codes of conduct and corporate 
governance rules, and ensuring that the 
corporate culture is aligned with its purpose 
and values.
b) Monitoring the implementation of the general 
policy on communication of economic and 
financial information, non-financial and 
corporate information and communication

with shareholders and investors, proxy 
advisors and other stakeholders. The manner 
in which the entity communicates and handles 
relations with small and medium-sized 
shareholders must also be monitored. 
c) The periodic evaluation and review of the 
company’s corporate governance system, and 
environmental and social policy, with a view to 
ensuring that they fulfil their purposes of 
promoting the interests of society and take 
account, as appropriate, of the legitimate 
interests of other stakeholders. 
d) Supervision of the company’s environmental 
and social practices to ensure they are in 
alignment with the established strategy and 
policy. 
e) Supervision and evaluation of the way in which 
relations with the various stakeholders are 
handled. 
Complies 
55. That environmental and social sustainability 
policies identify and include at least the 
following:
a) The principles, commitments, objectives and 
strategy relating to shareholders, employees, 
clients, suppliers, social issues, the 
environment, diversity, tax responsibility, 
respect for human rights, and the prevention 
of corruption and other unlawful conducts. 
b) Means or systems for monitoring compliance 
with these policies, their associated risks, and 
management. 
c) Mechanisms for supervising non-financial risk, 
including that related to ethical aspects and 
aspects of business conduct. 
d) Channels of communication, participation and 
dialogue with stakeholders. 
e) Responsible communication practices that 
impede the manipulation of data and protect 
integrity and honour. 
Complies 
56. That director remuneration be sufficient in 
order to attract and retain directors who meet 
the desired professional profile and to 
adequately compensate them for the dedication, 
qualifications and responsibility demanded of 
their posts, while not being so excessive as to 
compromise the independent judgment of non-
executive directors.  
Complies 
57. That only executive directors should receive 
remuneration linked to corporate results and 
personal performance, as well as remuneration in 
the form of shares, options or rights to shares or 
instruments referenced to the share price and 
long-term savings plans such as pension plans, 
retirement schemes or other provident schemes.  
Consideration may be given to delivering shares 
to non-executive directors as remuneration 
providing this is conditional upon their holding 
them until they cease to be directors. The 
forgoing shall not apply to shares that the 
director may need to sell in order to meet the 
costs related to their acquisition.  
Complies  
58. That as regards variable remuneration, 
remuneration policies should incorporate the 
necessary limits and technical safeguards to 
ensure that such remuneration is in line with the 
professional performance of its beneficiaries and 
not based solely on general developments in the 
markets or in the sector in which the company 
operates, or other similar circumstances.  
And, in particular, that variable remuneration 
components:  
a) Are linked to pre-determined and measurable 
performance criteria and that such criteria 
take into account the risk undertaken to 
achieve a given result.  
b) Promote sustainability of the company and 
include non-financial criteria that are geared 
towards creating long term value, such as 
compliance with the company's rules and 
internal operating procedures and with its risk 
management and control policies.  
c) Are based on balancing the attainment of 
short-, medium- and long-term objectives, so 
as to allow remuneration of continuous 
performance over a period of time long 
enough to be able to assess its contribution to 
the sustainable creation of value, such that 
the elements used to measure performance 
are not associated only with one-off, 
occasional or extraordinary events. 
Complies 
59. That the payment of variable remuneration 
components be subject to sufficient verification 
that previously established performance or other 
conditions have been effectively met. Entities 
must include in their annual report on director

remuneration the criteria for the time required 
and methods used for this verification depending 
on the nature and characteristics of each 
variable component.
That, additionally, companies consider the 
inclusion of a reduction (‘malus’) clause for the 
deferral of the payment of a portion of variable 
remuneration components that would imply their 
total or partial loss if an event were to occur 
prior to the time of payment date that would 
make this advisable. 
Complies 
60. That remuneration related to company 
results should take into account any reservations 
that might appear in the external auditor’s report 
and that would diminish said results.  
Complies
61. That a material portion of  executive 
directors' variable remuneration be linked to the 
delivery of shares or financial instruments 
referenced to the share price.  
Complies  
62. That once share or options or financial 
instruments have been allocated under 
remuneration schemes, executive directors be 
prohibited from transferring ownership or 
exercising options or rights until a term of at 
least three years has elapsed.
An exception is made in cases where the director 
has, at the time of the transfer or exercise of 
options or rights, a net economic exposure to 
changes in the share price for a market value 
equivalent to at least twice the amount of his or 
her fixed annual remuneration through the 
ownership of shares, options or other financial 
instruments.
The foregoing shall not apply to the shares that 
the director may need to sell in order to meet the 
costs related to their acquisition or, following a 
favourable assessment by the nomination and 
remuneration committee, to deal with such 
extraordinary situations as may arise and so 
require.   
Complies
63. That contractual arrangements should 
include a clause allowing the company to 
demand reimbursement of the variable 
remuneration components in the event that 
payment was not in accordance with the 
performance conditions or when payment was 
made based on data subsequently shown to have 
been inaccurate.  
Complies 
64. That payments for contract termination 
should not exceed an amount equivalent to two 
years of total annual remuneration and should 
not be paid until the company has been able to 
verify that the director has fulfilled all previously 
established criteria or conditions for payment.  
For the purposes of this recommendation, 
payments for contractual termination will be 
considered to include any payments the accrual 
of which arises as a consequence of or on the 
occasion of the termination of the contractual 
relationship between the director and the 
company, including amounts not previously 
vested of long-term savings schemes and 
amounts paid by virtue of post-contractual non-
competition agreements.
Explain 
With regards to the conditions applicable to 
termination of contracts Mr. José María Álvarez-
Pallete López (Executive Chairman until January 
18,2025), and the Chief Operating Officer (C.O.O.), Mr. 
Ángel Vilá Boix, maintain the conditions of his previous 
contract which provided for agreed economic 
compensation for the termination of the employment 
relationship, where applicable, that can amount to 
four years' of remuneration at the most. Annual 
remuneration on which the indemnity is based is the 
last fixed remuneration and the arithmetic mean of the 
last two variable remuneration payments received by 
contract.  
Indicate whether any director voted against or 
abstained from approving this report. 
No. 
I declare that the details included in this 
statistical annex coincide and are consistent 
with the descriptions and details included in the 
annual corporate governance report published 
by the company.

5.1. Annual Report on 
Remuneration
Introduction to the Report
This section 5.1 and the section 5.2 from the Annual 
Report on Remuneration, which must be drawn up and 
submitted to a vote of the General Shareholders' Meeting 
in an advisory manner. Pursuant to the provisions in Act 5 
of April 12, 2021, amending the redrafted text of the 
Corporate Enterprises Act, this report forms part of the 
Company's Management Report. This Report will remain 
accessible on the websites of the Company and the 
Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) 
for the legally stipulated term.
This report is essentially composed of two sections:
• First, a summary of our Directors' Remuneration Policy 
(the Remuneration Policy) applicable in 2025, approved 
at the Company's General Shareholders' Meeting held 
on March 31, 2023, with 92.66% of the votes cast (this 
policy can be accessed at the following link: https://
www.telefonica.com/en/wp-content/uploads/
sites/5/2021/10/remunerations-policy-directors-
telefonica.pdf).
• Secondly, it provides a description of how the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy has been applied during the fiscal 
year 2024. 
Outlined below is the background against which certain 
decisions related to the Remuneration Policy and its 
application have been made and considered by the 
Nominating, Compensation, and Corporate Governance 
Committee (NCCGC) and the Board of Directors of the 
Company
Telefónica in 2024
Financial Results

Free 
Cash 
Flow
It accelerates its growth and reaches 
2,634 million euros in 2024, a 14.1% 
increase compared to the same period of 
the previous year.
EBITDA
Profitable and sustainable growth of 
+1.2% adjusted, mainly due to the 
increase in revenue and the consistent 
generation of efficiencies, as well as the 
transformation process carried out by 
the Company over the past few years.
Revenues
Growth of +1.6%, The increase in revenue 
has been supported by service revenue 
(+2.5%), due to the strong performance 
of B2B revenue (+4.8%), with Telefónica 
Tech being a key driver of growth.
Additionally, other factors can be highlighted, such as the 
decrease in the intensity of invested capital, which has 
resulted in a CapEx over revenue ratio of 12.9% in 2024, 
reaching the target set for the year. Moreover, the cash 
margin, measured as EBITDA minus adjusted CapEx, has 
improved by 0.3 percentage points to reach 19.3%, 
demonstrating the improvement in the Company's 
operating leverage.
Commitment to our shareholders
Consistent execution of the strategy, along with the solid 
business performance, has resulted in a positive stock 
performance and has allowed the continuation of the 
dividend distribution policy. In this regard, Telefónica has 
confirmed the shareholder remuneration for 2024, 
consisting of a cash dividend of 0.30 euros per share, 
payable in two instalments: December 2024 (0.15 euros) 
and June 2025 (0.15 euros).

Thanks to this, Telefónica's Total Shareholder Return 
("TSR") in 2024 amounts to +19.87%, aligned with both the 
sector and its main markets. Over the last three years 
(2022-2024), the TSR has risen to +33.6%, significantly 
better than the sector's TSR of +14.1% (below the Ibex-35 
TSR of +50.6%), and above  both the median and the 75th 
percentile of the comparison group used in the Long-
Term Incentive Plan, which have been 4.58% and 26.88%, 
respectively.
Commitment to our clients
Telefonica has maintained a strong market position and 
growing value access, up 11% in FTTH (fibre to the home) 
and 2% in mobile contracts, while continuing to 
accelerate 5G deployment. In addition, improvements 
have been made in network agility, efficiency, 
intelligence, quality and sustainability (zero-touch 
process and AI). This is evidenced by the improvement in 
customer loyalty as measured by:
• The Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 33 (+2 p.p. vs. 2023), 
the historical maximum in certain geographies.
• Reduction in convergent customers churn rate. In 
Spain, this indicator is the lowest since 2013.
In addition, in Spain, it is worth highlighting the 
simultaneous year-on-year growth of all strategic 
accesses in 2024 for the first time since 2018, and an 
average revenue per convergent customer (ARPU) above 
90 euros.
Commitment to achievement Net Zero
In 2024, Telefónica continued to reduce emissions in line 
with its commitment to be net zero by 2040. Since 2015, 
the company has reduced emissions by 52% across all 3 
scopes. The Company is on track to achieve 100% 
renewable energy by 2030 achieving a level of 89% in 
2024.
Commitment to social impact and transparency
In the social area, Telefónica has made progress in 
diversity with 34% of women in executive positions, 
achieving solid progress towards its goal of 37% by 2027. 
Also, during the quarter, Telefónica was included in the 
'FT Diversity Leader' for the sixth consecutive year and 
scored 81/100 in the latest EcoVadis report, placing the 
Company in the 99th percentile among all evaluated 
companies (around 130,000). Lastly, in terms of 
governance, Telefónica has actively participated in 
developing the code of conduct for the Artificial 
Intelligence Office and has joined the EU AI Pact for the 
development of reliable and safe AI. Furthermore, last 
October, the Company received the highest award in the 
Reporting and Transparency category of the Reuters 
Sustainability Awards 2024.
New leadership
The Board of Directors agreed on January 18, 2025 to 
terminate the contract with Mr. José María Álvarez-
Pallete López as Executive Chairman and to appoint Mr. 
Marc Thomas Murtra Millar as Executive Director by co-
optation and Executive Chairman of the Board of 
Directors of the Company. Concerning this Report, the 
information provided reflects the details of the 
remuneration of the former Executive Chairman in the 
sections related to 2024, and that of the new Executive 
Chairman in the sections corresponding to the fiscal year 
2025.
Implementation of the Executive Directors' 
Remuneration Policy in 2024
Below is a summary of the main characteristics of the 
remuneration of Executive Directors for the year 2024:
• Fixed components of remuneration (Fixed 
Remuneration, Remuneration in Kind, and Pension 
Plan): unchanged from the previous year, subject to 
minor differences in the valuation of Remuneration in 
Kind.
• Short-Term Variable Remuneration: The metrics and 
relative weights established for 2024 were Free Cash 
Flow (30%), Operating Revenues (25%), EBITDA (25%),  
and non-financial objectives - ESG (20%).
The weighted payment coefficient has risen to 78.38% 
of the maximum amount, as a result of the overall 
achievement level of financial objectives being around  
target level. In addition, the degree of performance of 
the non-financial - ESG has exceeded target levels.
• Long-Term Variable Remuneration: the performance 
period of the Second cycle of the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan approved by the Annual General Meeting of 
Shareholders in 2021 ended on 31 December 2024. 
50% of the incentive was subject to the relative TSR, 
40% to the Free Cash Flow generated in each of the 
years of the performance period, and 10% to the 
Neutralization of CO2 emissions Scope 1+2. Due to the 
strong performance of the stock and dividends paid 
during the 2022-2024 period, Telefónica's TSR has 
reached 33.6%. This percentage places Telefónica in 
fourth position within the comparison group, allowing 
the payout linked to the Relative TSR objective to reach 
100%. 
Additionally, both (i) the Free Cash Flow objective has 
been achieved, enabling the Company to continue 
reducing debt and improving flexibility, and (ii) the 
Neutralization of CO2 emissions objective has been 
achieved, in line with the commitments made by the 
Company regarding carbon emissions. Thus, the 
weighted payout coefficient of the Long-Term Variable 
Remuneration has reached 100%.

Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy in 2025
The Remuneration Policy to be applied in 2025 follows a continuity with that applied in 2024. The design of the 
Short and Long-Term Variable Remuneration seeks to incentivise the achievement of the Company's strategic 
priorities, in addition to the creation of value for the shareholder and the rest of its stakeholders.
The remuneration system applicable to Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra Millar, as Executive Chairman, will be that provided 
for in the Telefónica Directors‘ Remuneration Policy approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 31 
March 2023. A summary of the policy applicable in 2025 is shown below:

5.1.1. Principles of the Remuneration 
Policy 
The main focus of Telefónica’s remuneration strategy is 
to attract, retain and motivate professionals of the 
Company, enabling it to achieve its strategic objectives 
within the highly competitive and globalised setting in 
which it performs its business, by applying the most 
appropriate measures and practices for such purpose.
Based on the foregoing, the principles of the 
Remuneration Policy are the following: 
Executive 
Directors
Non-
Executive 
Directors
Value creation
The Policy is consistent with Telefónica's commitment to growth, efficiency and 
long-term sustainable value creation for its stakeholders.
•
Pay for 
Performance
A significant part of the total remuneration for the Executive Directors is 
variable and receiving it is subject to achieving financial, business, value 
creation and non-financial objectives, including ESG objectives. These 
objectives are predetermined, specific, quantifiable and aligned with the 
Company’s strategy.
•
Flexibility
The variable remuneration is not guaranteed and is sufficiently flexible so that 
there is a possibility of not paying this component.
•
Competitiveness
In order to ensure the Company has the best professionals on board, the 
remuneration package must be competitive, both in its structure and its overall 
amount, with respect to other comparable companies at an international level.
•
•
Good Governance When determining the remuneration for the Directors, the Company takes into 
consideration the developments taking place in regulations, best practices and 
national and international recommendations and trends related to the 
remuneration of Directors of companies listed on the stock market.
•
•
Fair Pay
Fair remuneration is provided for professional value, skills, experience, 
responsibility undertaken and results achieved. 
The Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is aligned with the policy 
for the other employees and shares the same principles and criteria for action 
and incorporating the components included in the remuneration package for 
Telefónica's management group. 
The Policy is consistent with Telefónica's inclusive culture, which includes a 
commitment to diversity and inclusion management as a key element in 
connecting talent and growth as a company.
•
•
Suitability
The amounts are sufficient to remunerate the qualifications, time spent and 
responsibility of the Directors, guaranteeing their required loyalty and 
allegiance to the Company, without compromising the independence of the 
Non-Executive Directors.
•
Transparency
The level of transparency in relation to remuneration is in line with the best 
corporate governance practices in order to create trust among all the 
stakeholders, including shareholders and investors.

80%.

5.1.4. The Executive Directors’ 
remuneration in 2025 
• The Fixed Remuneration of the new Executive Chairman, 
Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra Millar is set in the Directors' 
Remuneration Policy. This amount was applicable to Mr. 
José María Álvarez-Pallete López until the date of his 
termination and remained unchanged since 2013. In the 
case of the Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix, 
his amount remains unchanged since his appointment in 
2017.
• Variable performance-related remuneration is significant 
in relation to total remuneration (79% for the Executive 
Chairman and 77% for the Chief Operating Officer)           
• The variable remuneration metrics and achievement 
levels are aligned to the main axes of Telefónica's 
Strategy.
• The maximum value of the allocated shares to the 
Second cycle (2025-2027) of the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan 2024-2028 is below the maximum limit established 
in the Remuneration Policy.
• The structure and contribution levels (as a percentage of 
base salary) of the Executive Directors' Pension Plan are 
aligned with the conditions that apply to the rest of 
Telefónica's employees in Spain.
• Telefónica has an Executive Compensation Recoupment 
Policy, which clearly and comprehensively regulates the 
Company's right to recover variable remunerations paid 
during the general three-year clawback period.
As specified above, on the date of this Report, the 
Executive Directors of Telefónica, S.A. are Mr. Marc 
Thomas Murtra Villar, Executive Chairman, and Mr. Ángel 
Vilá Boix, Chief Operating Officer (COO).
Pay for performance and pay mix
The remuneration system for Telefónica's Executive 
Directors is characterised by its competitiveness and high 
standards. Variable remuneration, designed to incentivise 
the achievement of the Company's objectives, both in the 
short and long term, is a fundamental pillar of this system.
In this regard, Telefónica's long-term strategy is based on 
three fundamental pillars to which the variable 
remuneration of the entire Telefónica team is linked:
i.
Growth, in the form of Operative Revenue and Total 
Shareholder Return. 
ii.
Efficiency, through EBITDA improvement, Free Cash 
Flow generation and reduction of GHG emissions, 
through efficient consumption of natural resources 
or the circular economy.
iii.
Trust. Telefónica is a company committed to 
sustainability. For this reason, factors such as 
customer trust (NPS), the trust of society and 
gender equality (% of women in executive positions) 
and the contribution to the fight against climate 
change (neutralisation of GHG emissions) are 
weighted.
Consequently, the achievement of both short- and long-
term variable remuneration is linked to the achievement 
of financial and operational business and sustainability 
(ESG) objectives. 
All the objectives are predetermined, specific, 
quantifiable and aligned with Telefónica’s strategic goals, 
strictly determined and assessed by the NCCGC, which 
monitors them, so that their alignment with Telefónica’s 
social interests is ensured. 
From the perspective of the remuneration mix the 
Executive Directors' pay package is leveraged mainly on 
variable remuneration, with most of the total 
remuneration being received only if the objectives set out 
for the short- and long-term variable remuneration are 
met. This pay structure is consistent with the “pay for 
performance” principle.
The Executive Directors therefore may not receive any 
variable remuneration in the event that the minimum 
performance thresholds are not met. The short-term and 
long-term variable remuneration percentage is significant 
in relation to the total remuneration.
The pay mix for Telefónica’s Executive Directors is shown 
below, a scenario where objectives an achieved at a 
target level*:

Comparison Group
When establishing the remuneration package in 2025, 
NCCGC conducts a periodic review of the Directors' 
remunerations. As part of this process, an external 
competitiveness remuneration analyses are conducted, 
and the remuneration policy of the Executives and the 
organization's employees is also considered.
To carry out external competitiveness analyses, under 
the framework established in the Remuneration Policy, it 
is expected to propose a reference market established 
based on a series of objective criteria, as outlined below:
1.
Sufficient number of companies to obtain 
statistically reliable and robust results.
2. Size (revenue, asset volume, market capitalization, 
and number of employees) and complexity of the 
business. For each of the selected companies, the 
dimension data for each of the mentioned variables 
must fall within predetermined ranges.
3. Geographic distribution: Only companies included 
in the Stoxx All Europe 100, Ibex-35, and European 
companies in the telecommunications sector have 
been considered.
4. Geographical scope: Companies with international 
presence.
5. Sectoral distribution: Multi sectoral sample with a 
homogeneous distribution, avoiding over-
representation of sectors very different from 
Telefónica.
Taking these criteria into account, the comparison group 
would be composed of 20 European companies with 
international presence. The most represented 
geographies will be those where Telefónica's business 
presence is highest. Consequently, the country that will 
contribute with a higher number of companies to the 
comparison group will be Spain. Additionally, it will ensure 
of that the telecommunications sector has the highest 
relative weight within the group.
Considering this comparison group, the total 
remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer in a target 
scenario of objective achievement would fall between 
the median and the 75th percentile of the comparison 
group.
Components of the remuneration package in 
2025: 
The elements included in the remuneration package for 
Executive Directors for the performance of their 
executive duties are similar to those of the 2024 fiscal 
year: 
A. FIXED REMUNERATION 
Purpose:
To reward the performance of their executive duties 
according to the level of responsibility, leadership and 
performance within the organization, promoting the 
retention of key staff and attracting top talent and 
creating sufficient economic independence to balance 
the significance of other remunerative items.

Directors at the proposal of the NCCGC and may be 
adjusted every year depending on the criteria approved 
from time to time by the NCCGC. 
B. SHORT-TERM VARIABLE REMUNERATION

The Maximum Amount in 2025 will be 129.5% of the 
Target Amount, within the maximum level established in 
the Remuneration Policy.
This Maximum Amount could be achieved in case of 
overachievement of the Free Cash Flow target level, 
provided that the EBITDA target level is also met.
Functioning: 
For the fiscal year 2025, the NCCGC has reviewed the 
objectives, metrics and performance scales to be applied 
in order to ensure the Company's  strategy fulfillment.
As a result, based on the NCCGC's proposal, the Board 
has approved the same metrics that were established in 
2024, as they quantitatively measure the aforementioned 
Telefónica's strategic priorities.
For the purpose of calculating the payment coefficient 
obtained for each level of objective performance, a 
performance scale is determined for each metric, which 
includes a minimum threshold below which no incentive 
is paid. In the case of 100% objective performance, the 
Target Amount Short-Term Variable Remuneration will 
be paid and, in case of maximum objective performance 
the Maximum Amount Short-Term Variable 
Remuneration will be received. 
Information in greater detail is provided below about the 
performance scales for each of the objectives and how 
the stipulated maximum is achieved:

In order to calculate the amount of the Short-Term 
Variable Remuneration, the NCCGC firstly considers the 
level of achievement and weighting of each objectives on 
an individual basis and then the overall level of 
achievement of the objectives as a whole. For such 
purpose, it applies the internal objective assessment rules 
and procedures set out by the Company for its 
executives. When conducting this assessment, the 
NCCGC is supported by the Audit and Control 
Committee, which provides information about the results 
audited by the company’s external auditor 
(PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS AUDITORES, S.L.) and 
by the internal audit. The Committee also considers any 
associated risk for both setting the objectives and 
assessing their performance thereof.
In this respect, any positive or negative economic effects 
caused by extraordinary events that could distort the 
findings of the assessment are disregarded and the long-
term quality of the results and any associated risk are 
considered in the proposed Short-Term Variable 
Remuneration.
The Short-Term Variable Remuneration is fully paid in 
cash providing the targets set for this purpose have been 
achieved. This remuneration will not be paid until the 
NCCGC and the Audit and Supervisory Committee have 
carried out the actions described above in the first 
quarter of the following year, in line with

Code for listed companies.
C. LONG-TERM VARIABLE REMUNERATION 
Purpose: 
To increase the Executive Directors’ and management 
team’s commitment to the company and its strategy, 
linking their remuneration to creating value for the 
shareholders and sustainable strategic objective 
performance, so that they are in line with the best 
remuneration practices. In turn, by means of its Long-
Term Incentive Plan, the company also aims at offering a 
competitive remuneration package that contributes to 
retaining the managers who hold key positions in the 
organization.

Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete López, as Executive 
Chairman of Telefónica until 18 January 2025, maintains 
his right to the proportional part of the incentive 
corresponding to the Third cycle (2023-2025) of the 
2021-2025 Long-Term Incentive Plan and to the First 
cycle (2024-2026) of the 2024-2028 Long-Term 
Incentive Plan.
The number of shares allocated in each of the cycles is 
significantly lower than the maximum limit established in 
the Remuneration Policy as well as the limit established in 
the respective General Shareholders' Meetings that 
approved each of the Plans.
Operation of the New Long-Term Incentive Plan 
2024-2028:
The 2024 General Shareholders' Meeting approved the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2024-2028 consisting of the 
delivery of Telefónica, S.A. shares to Telefónica Group 
Executives, including Telefónica, S.A. Executive Directors 
who, complying with the requirements established for 
such purpose, are invited to participate in the Plan.
The plan has a total duration of five (5) years and is 
divided into three (3) cycles, independent of each other, 
of three (3) years each (First cycle 2024-2026, Second 
cycle 2025-2027 and Third cycle 2026-2028).
The number of shares to be delivered at the end of each 
of the cycles will depend on the number of shares 
allocated and the degree of achievement of the Plan's 
objectives.
The details of the First cycle (2024-2026) of the 
2024-2028 Long-Term Incentive Plan are described in 
the Annual Directors' Remuneration Report for 2023. The 
metrics, weightings and payout levels are identical to 
those described below for the Second cycle (2025-2027).

Relative TSR (50%)
Definition: Share profitability taking into account the 
sum of the cumulative variation of Telefónica’s share 
value, plus the dividends and other similar items received 
by shareholders during the cycle in question.
Determining the level of achievement: The evolution 
of TSR from Telefónica’s shares is measured from the 
beginning of the cycle (2025) until the end of such cycle 
(2027), in relation to the TSR from other companies 
pertaining to the telecommunication sector, weighted

depending on their relevance to Telefónica S.A. that, for 
the purpose of the Plan, will be used as the comparison 
group. The companies included in the comparison group 
are the following: Vodafone Group, America Movil, 
Deutsche Telekom, BT Group, Orange, Telecom Italia, 
Telenor, TeliaSonera, Swisscom, Koninklijke KPN, TIM 
Brasil, Proximus, Millicom and Liberty Global.
Performance Scale: The number of shares to be 
delivered associated with the performance of this 
objective will be between 15% of the number of target 
theoretical shares granted, in the case the evolution of 
the TSR of Telefónica S.A.’s shares is, at least, the median 
of the Comparison Group (below this threshold no 
incentive will be payable) and 50% if the evolution is in 
the third or higher quartile of the comparison group. The 
results between the median and the third quartile, the 
incentive level will be calculated by linear interpolation.
Free Cash Flow (40%)
Definition: Free cash flow generation (FCF).
Determining the level of achievement: The level of 
FCF generated by the Telefónica Group is measured 
during each year, in comparison with the value set in the 
budgets approved by the Board of Directors for each 
year, considering the final level of FCF performance, the 
average of the annual partial results obtained and 
approved by the NCCGC.
Performance scale: 
The scale of attainment for the Second cycle will be as 
follows:
i.
Minimum threshold of 92% achievement, below 
which no incentive is paid and the performance 
of which implies 20% of the theoretical target 
shares granted.
ii.
Target level of 100% achievement, which implies 
the delivery of 40% of the theoretical target 
shares granted.
iii.
Maximum level of 115% achievement, which 
would entail the delivery of an additional 20% to 
the theoretical target shares granted, and which 
will be applicable provided that the 100% target 
of Free Cash Flow is met in each of the years 
comprising this Second cycle (2025-2027), thus 
ensuring continuity in cash generation while 
incentivizing overachievement.
Neutralization of CO2 Emissions (5%)
Definition: Level of Neutralization/Offset of the 
Telefónica Group's CO2 emissions at the end of each 
cycle of the Plan, with the additional requirement for this 
part of the incentive to be paid being to achieve a 
minimum level of Scope 1 + 2 emissions reduction, in line 
with the 1.5 ºC scenario of the Paris Agreement (SBTi). All 
this is aimed at achieving net zero emissions by 2040 and 
neutralising Scope 1+2 emissions from 2025 in its main 
markets.
Scope 1 and 2 emissions consist of direct and indirect 
CO2 emissions from daily activity caused by fuel 
consumption, leakage of refrigerant gases and electricity 
use.
Emission Neutralisation/offsetting is the purchase of 
carbon credits to absorb or reduce CO2 emissions from 
the atmosphere. 
In accordance with Telefónica's Climate Action Plan, and 
the recommendations of SBTi, carbon credits for 
reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation 
will also be accepted, with the aim of contributing to 
slowing deforestation in certain regions where Telefónica 
operates.
Carbon credits involve the purchase of CO2 certificates 
on the voluntary market. These credits are generated 
from projects that absorb or reduce the emission of CO2 
from the atmosphere, which must be certified to 
international standards of the highest quality and where 
possible have social benefits associated with them. This 
is verified on an annual basis by an external auditor.
Determining the level of achievement: Neutralisation/
offsetting of emissions is calculated as the ratio between 
the amount of carbon credits retired on behalf of the 
Company and the Scope 1+2 emissions.
The level of direct and indirect CO2 emissions from 
Telefónica's daily activity is calculated according to the 
following formula: 
CO2 emission = Activity Data x Emission Factor
Where:
–
Activity Data: The amount of energy, fuel, gas, etc. consumed by 
the company during the year.
–
Emission Factor: The amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere 
by the consumption of each activity unit.
For electricity, the emission factor provided by official sources 
(European Union, Ministries, CNMC, etc.) is used and for fuels the 
GHG Protocol emission factors are used and IPCC (UN 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).
Performance scale: The Board of Directors, according 
to a proposal made by the NCCGC, has determined a 
performance scale that includes a minimum threshold of 
90% achievement, below which no incentive is paid and 
the achievement of which implies 2.5% of the theoretical 
shares granted being delivered, and a maximum level of 
100% achievement, which implies 5% of the theoretical 
shares granted being delivered. In addition, achieving a 
minimum level of emissions reductions of Scope 1 + 2, in 
line with the 1.5°C scenario of the Paris Agreement (SBTi), 
will be necessary for this part of the incentive to be paid.

% of Women in Executive positions (5%)
Definition: Percentage of women in executive positions 
in the Telefónica Group at 31 December 2027, measured 
as the number of women in management positions 
compared to the total number of executive positions in 
Telefónica.
Determination the level of achievement: The 
percentage of women executive positions is compared to 
the target percentage set by the Board of Directors for 
2027.
Performance scale: The Board of Directors, at the 
proposal of the NCCGC, has determined a performance 
scale that includes a minimum threshold of 90% 
compliance, below which no incentive will be paid and 
compliance with which will entail the delivery of 2.5% of 
the theoretical shares granted, and a maximum level of 
100% compliance, which will entail the delivery of 5% of 
the theoretical shares granted.
The NCCGC conducts an assessment of the objectives 
on an annual basis and, once each cycle has ended, the 
level of performance is determined. When conducting 
this assessment, the NCCGC is supported by the Audit 
and Control Committee, which provides information on 
the results audited by the external auditor and the 
Company's internal auditor, which will have been 
analysed first by the Audit and Control Committee itself. 
The NCCGC also considers any associated risk for both 
setting the objectives and assessing their achievement.
When determining the objective performance level, any 
positive or negative economic effects caused by 
extraordinary events that may distort the findings of the 
assessment are disregarded and the long-term quality of 
the results are considered in the proposed Long-Term 
Variable Remuneration.
In any case, 100% of the shares settled within the scope 
of the Plan to the Executive Directors are subject to a 
retention period of two years, which will be increased to 
three years in case the shareholding commitment is not 
fulfilled.
The foregoing is not applicable to the shares that the 
Executive Directors need to sell to pay the costs related 
to their acquisition or, with prior consideration of the 
NCCGC, to cover extraordinary situations where this is 
required.
Operation of the Third cycle (2023-2025) of the Long 
Term Incentive Plan 2021-2025:
The main characteristics of these cycles are described in 
the Annual Directors' Remuneration Reports for the year 
2022.

Impact of a change in control on Long-Term Variable 
Remuneration: 
In the event of a change in control in Telefónica, the 
cycles in progress in 2025 will be subject to early 
settlement on a pro rata basis, delivering to the Members, 
where appropriate, the shares, or the equivalent amount 
in cash, taking into account for such purpose the closing 
price of the last stock exchange session of the month 
immediately prior to the date on which the change of 
control occurs.
The incentive to be paid is pro-rated for the time elapsed 
since the start date of the relevant cycle, and adjusted 
according to the achievement of objectives on the date 
of the change of control.
D. PENSION PLAN FOR TELEFÓNICA’S EMPLOYEES
Contributions: 
The Pension Plan for the Executive Directors follows the 
same structure as in recent years that will be adapted for 
the Executive Chairman situation maintaining the 
conditions described below which are identical to those 
applied to the rest of Telefónica's staff in Spain:
• The Executive Chairman: 4.51% of his base salary, plus 
2.2% as a mandatory contribution to be made by the 
Executive Chairman up to the maximum annual limit 
that the law stipulates from time to time. 
• Chief Operating Officer: 4.51% of his base salary, plus 
2.2% as a mandatory contribution to be made by the 
Chief Operating Officer up to the maximum annual limit 
that the law stipulates from time to time.
Functioning: 
As described in each of the Executive Directors 
contracts, the Pension Plan is a defined-contribution plan 
and the contingencies covered are as follows: retirement; 
the member’s death; the beneficiary’s death; total and

permanent disability to work in one’s usual profession, 
absolute and permanent incapacity for all work and 
serious disability; and severe or major dependency of the 
member.
The benefits consist of the economic right accrued by 
the beneficiaries as a result of the occurrence of any of 
the contingencies covered by this Pension Plan. It is 
quantified according to the number of account units that 
correspond to each member based on the amounts 
contributed to the Pension Plan and is assessed for the 
purpose of payment according to the value of the 
account unit from the business day before the date when 
the benefits become effective.
The members may also exercise their vested rights, in 
whole or in part, on an exceptional basis in the event of 
serious illness or long-term unemployment.
The Pension Plan is included within the “Fonditel B Fondo 
de Pensiones,” managed by Fonditel Pensiones, EGFP, 
S.A. 
In the fiscal year 2025 the regulations may change the 
financial and tax limits for contributions to pension plans. 
In this respect, and in the case of that, as has been the 
case in the past, a collective unit-link insurance policy has 
been taken out to cover the excess of contribution over 
the annual fiscal limits included in the legislation. 
This unit-link insurance policy taken out with the 
company Occident GCO, S.A.U. de Seguros y 
Reaseguros covers the same contingencies as those 
included in the Pension Plan with the same exceptional 
liquidity events in the case of serious illness or long-term 
unemployment. 
In the case of the Executive Chairman, if contributions 
cannot be made to the above social welfare formulas, 
Telefónica will make contributions of the agreed amounts 
to one or more life insurance and savings policies or 
equivalent financial instruments.
E. REMUNERATION IN KIND 
In addition to the life insurance policy covering death or 
disability described above, the Executive Directors are 
provided with a general health insurance policy and 
dental coverage as remuneration in kind and they are 
also provided with a company vehicle, all of the foregoing 
in line with the general policy applicable to the 
Company’s Executives. 
Moreover, Telefónica has taken out a third-party liability 
insurance policy (D&O) for its managers, executives and 
staff performing similar duties in the Telefónica Group, 
with the usual terms and conditions for these kinds of 
insurance policies. This policy also includes the 
company’s subsidiaries in certain cases.
Clawback clauses for the variable remuneration 
Telefónica has an Executive Officer Compensation 
Recoupment Policy, which clearly and comprehensively 
regulates the company's right to recover variable 
compensations paid during the general three-year 
clawback period.
The Remuneration Policy submitted to the vote of the 
General Shareholders' Meeting in 2023 standardized the 
clawback clauses applicable to all variable remuneration, 
establishing that the Board of Directors shall assess, 
following a report from the NCCGC, whether it is 
appropriate (i) to cancel all or part of the variable 
remuneration that is pending payment, and/or (ii) the 
total or partial recovery of any element of variable 
remuneration within thirty-six (36) months after the 
payment thereof ("clawback"), when there are certain 
exceptional circumstances that affect the Company's 
results, or that derive from an inappropriate conduct of 
the Executive Director.
Additionally, this regime has been complemented and 
developed by an Executive Officer Compensation 
Recoupment Policy approved by the Board of Directors in 
2023, at the proposal of the NCCGC, with which 
Telefónica consolidates its commitment to the best 
practices in remuneration matters at international level 
and complies with the listing requirements for issuers of 
foreign securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, 
as well as with the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of the 
United States of America (U. S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act). S. Dodd-Frank 
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.)
Regarding clawback formulae or clauses in order to claim 
the return of the variable remuneration components 
based on results, the following should be taken into 
account if such components have been paid based on 
data that is later clearly shown to be inaccurate, and in 
order to adopt measures to avoid any conflict of interest: 
• The NCCGC is authorized to propose cancellation of 
payment of the variable remuneration to the Board of 
Directors under circumstances of this kind. 
• Furthermore, the NCCGC must assess whether 
exceptional circumstances of this kind could even lead 
to termination of the relationship with the respective 
party or parties responsible, proposing to the Board of 
Directors that such measures should be adopted as 
may be appropriate. 
For these purposes, exceptional situations shall be 
deemed as those that will be subject to assessment by 
the Board of Directors, among others, as examples but 
not limited thereto, the following:
• Reformulating the company’s financial statements 
without being based on an amendment of the 
applicable accounting standards.

• If the Executive Officer has been sanctioned for a 
serious breach of the code of conduct and other 
internal regulations or serious breach of the regulations 
that are also applicable thereto.
• In any case, when it is shown that the variable 
remuneration component in question has been partially 
or fully assessed based on information that is clearly 
proven to be false or inaccurate a posteriori, or other 
unforeseen circumstances not accepted by the 
company that have a serious negative impact on the 
profit and loss accounts.
• If the company’s external auditor includes exceptions in 
its report that reduce the results taken into 
consideration to determine the amount of the variable 
remuneration payable. 
Possible severance pay 
The contracts signed with the Executive Directors are for 
an indefinite term and include a non-competition clause. 
This clause implies that, once the relevant contract has 
been terminated and during the valid term of the clause 
(two years after the termination of the contract for any 
reason), the Executive Directors may not indirectly or 
directly render their services themselves or through 
others, either on their own behalf or for third parties, to 
Spanish or foreign companies that engage in the same or 
similar business activities as Telefónica. 
As regards the conditions related to the termination of 
contracts, the current Directors‘ Remuneration Policy 
approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 
31 March 2023 (the ‘2023 Policy’) provides for a 
severance payment equal to two years' remuneration. In 
its application, the commercial contract of the new 
Executive Chairman, Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra Millar, 
signed in January 2025 provides for a termination 
indemnity of an amount equal to the aforementioned two 
annuities. Each annuity comprises the last Fixed 
Remuneration and the arithmetic mean of the last two 
Annual Variable Remunerations received according to 
the contract.
With respect to the conditions related to the termination 
of the commercial contract of the Chief Operating Officer 
(C.O.O.), Mr Ángel Vilá Boix, the 2023 Policy establishes 
the maintenance of the conditions of his previous 
contract, which provides for a severance payment of up 
to a maximum of four years' salary.
These same conditions were applicable to the former 
Executive Chairman, Mr José María Álvarez-Pallete López 
who, as a consequence of his termination, was paid in 
January 2025 a severance payment of 23,525,668 euros 
gross.
On the other hand, the Executive Directors participate in 
a Pension Plan for Executives that covers the 
contingencies of retirement, early retirement, permanent 
incapacity to work in the degrees of total or absolute 
incapacity or severe disability and death, and whose 
annual contribution is equivalent to 35% of the Fixed 
Remuneration, after deducting the contributions made to 
the Pension Plan for Telefónica employees described in 
section D above. 
The instrumentation vehicle of this Plan approved in 
2006 is a collective life insurance in the unit link modality 
arranged with an insurance company, and the amount of 
the benefit of this guarantee will be equivalent to the 
mathematical provision corresponding to the insured on 
the date on which the policyholder notifies and accredits 
the insurer of access to any of the situations covered by 
the Plan.
Vesting of rights in favour of Executive Directors is not 
currently envisaged. In the event of any legal amendment 
in this respect, the Board of Directors, at the proposal of 
the NCCGC, may make the appropriate adjustments. 
Thus, in accordance with the change in the current Policy 
2023, the receipt of the aforementioned severance 
compensation (and not only that corresponding to the 
termination of the employment relationship as before) is 
incompatible with the recognition of any financial 
entitlement in connection with the Executive Pension 
Plan.
In this respect, the commercial contract signed in January 
2025 with the new Executive Chairman, Mr. Marc 
Thomas Murtra Millar, expressly provides that, in the 
event of receiving the aforementioned financial 
compensation for termination, he will not be entitled to 
any financial rights deriving from this Plan. 
The contracts signed under previous Directors' 
Remuneration Policies, such as the one signed with the 
Chief Operating Officer (C.O.O.), Mr Ángel Vilá Boix, do 
not contain the aforementioned incompatibility.
The same circumstance applies to the contract signed 
with the former Executive Chairman, Mr. José María 
Álvarez-Pallete López. The treatment of this discrepancy 
between the contract signed and Policy 2023 is the 
subject of a legal opinion and is pending determination at 
the date of this report.
Although no changes are foreseen in the operation of the 
Executives' Pension Plan, should any changes be made 
to it, these must be agreed by the Board of Directors. The 
NCCGC must state the reasons for the modification and 
propose it, and, if applicable, the reasons for the 
modification must be duly disclosed in the Annual 
Directors' Remuneration Report.
Contractual terms and conditions for the 
Executive Directors 
The contracts that currently regulate the Executive 
Directors performing their duties and responsibilities are 
of a commercial nature and include clauses that are 
normally used for these kinds of contracts. These

contracts were been proposed by the NCCGC, approved 
by the Board of Directors. The contracts of the previous 
Executive Chairman and the Chief Operating Officer 
have not suffered significant changes during 2024. The 
contract of Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra Millar as Executive 
Chairman was approved in January 2025, on the 
occasion of his appointment as Executive Chairman.
In addition to the severance pay terms and conditions 
explained in the previous point, a summary is provided 
below of the main terms and conditions of the Executive 
Directors’ contracts: 
• Term: Indefinite 
• Prior notice: There is an obligation to provide prior 
notice in the event of the contract being terminated 
due to a unilateral decision adopted by the Executive 
Director, being stipulated that he must notify such 
unilateral decision in writing with at least three months’ 
prior notice, except in cases of force majeure. If this 
obligation is not fulfilled, he must pay the Company an 
amount equivalent to the Fixed Remuneration for the 
period of prior notice he had failed to observe. 
• Exclusivity: During the term of the contracts, it is 
prohibited to sign (either directly or through 
intermediaries) any employment, commercial or civil 
contracts with other companies or institutions that 
engage in activities similar in nature to those of 
Telefónica. 
• Non-competition clause: The contract states the 
relationship is compatible with holding representative, 
administrative and management posts and other 
professional positions in other companies in the 
Telefónica Group or in any other undertakings 
unrelated to the Company when expressly notified to 
the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate 
Governance Committee and the Board of Directors. 
On the other hand, it states that the relationship is 
incompatible, during the term of the clause (two (2) 
years after the termination of the contract for any 
reason) with directly or indirectly rendering services, as 
an employee or self-employed, by themselves or 
through third parties, to any Spanish or foreign 
companies that engage in activities identical or similar 
to those of Telefónica. 
• Non-disclosure: While the relationship remains in force 
and also after the termination thereof, there is a non-
disclosure duty regarding any information, data and any 
kinds of reserved and confidential documents that they 
have knowledge of or to which they have had access 
as a result of performing their duties. 
• Compliance with the regulatory system: The contracts 
include the obligation to abide by the rules and 
obligations set out within Telefónica’s regulatory 
system, which are contained, among other regulations, 
in the Board of Directors’ Regulations and Telefónica’s 
Internal Stock Market Conduct Regulations. 
Shareholding commitment
As stipulated in the Remuneration Policy, the Executive 
Directors must hold (directly or indirectly) a number of 
shares (including those provided as remuneration) 
equivalent to two (2) years’ gross fixed remuneration as 
long as they are members on the Board of Directors and 
perform executive duties.
The term set for achieving this objective is five years, 
counted from 1 January 2019 or, in the case of Executive 
Chaiman, as he has been appointed after 1 January 2019, 
counted from the date of his appointment (18 January 
2025). The Board of Directors/NCCGC may approve a 
longer term when exceptional situations arise.
Shareholding Requirement
Executive Chairman
200% Gross Fixed Remuneration
Chief Operating Officer
200% Gross Fixed Remuneration
As long as the number of shares subject to this 
commitment has not been reached, the shares that the 
Executive Director receives within the scope of any 
variable remuneration component will be subject to a 
minimum retention period of 3 years; therefore raising the 
Executive Director’s level of commitment.
The foregoing is not applicable to the shares that the 
Executive Directors need to sell to pay the costs related 
to their acquisition or, with prior consideration of the 
NCCGC, to cover extraordinary situations where this is 
required.
This commitment will be verified by the NCCGC, which, 
among other issues, will consider aspects such as the 
share price to be taken into account or the regularity with 
which the holding commitment will be reviewed.
As of December 31, 2024, the Chief Operating Officer 
(COO), Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix, held 1,088,504 Telefónica 
shares. Therefore, the Chief Operating Officer complies 
with the shareholding commitment.
5.1.5. The Directors’ remuneration in 
their positions as such in 2025
The remuneration payable to the Directors in their 
positions as such remains unchanged since 2012.
Mr. Marc Thomas Murtra Millar has waived the amounts 
that would correspond to him as Chairman of the Board 
of Directors and of the Executive Committee, i.e. 
240,000 euros and 80,000 euros, respectively.
The remuneration payable to the Directors in their 
positions as such is structured, within the legal and 
statutory framework, pursuant to the remunerative 
criteria and items specified below, up to the maximum 
limit determined for such purpose by the General

Shareholders’ Meeting, pursuant to the provisions in 
Article 35 of the Articles of Association.
According to the foregoing, the Ordinary General 
Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 11, 2003 set the 
annual gross maximum amount for the remuneration at 
€6,000,000 payable to the Directors in their positions as 
members of the Board of Directors.
The aforementioned remuneration is, in all cases, the 
maximum amount payable and the Board of Directors is 
responsible for proposing the allotment of the amount 
among the various items and among the different 
Directors, taking into account the duties and 
responsibilities assigned to each Director, membership on 
Committees within the Board of Directors and other 
objective circumstances that would be considered 
relevant.
Regarding the fiscal year 2025, according to the market 
information available, the NCCGC has proposed to the 
Board of Directors not to increase the Directors’ fixed 
remuneration, except as indicated below in relation to the 
Lead Independent Director. This remuneration has 
remained the same since 2012.

the aforementioned amounts (i.e. €240,000 as Chairman of the Board of 
Directors and €80,000 as Chairman of the Executive Committee), as he has 
done in previous years.
The Executive Directors can waive payment of the 
aforementioned amounts. 
Moreover, the Non-Executive Directors receive the 
remuneration payable to them due to being members of 
certain management bodies of Telefónica’s subsidiaries 
and investee companies.
In addition, and given the importance of the function 
performed by the Lead Independent Director, at the 
proposal of the NCCGC, the Board of Directors has 
agreed to assign an additional remuneration of 80,000 
euros for the exercise of this position.
5.1.6. Application of the 
Remuneration Policy in 2024
Summary of the Remuneration Policy applied in 
2024 and the results of the ballot on the Annual 
Report on Remuneration of the Directors for 
2023
The remuneration for the year 2024 has followed the 
terms established in the Remuneration Policy approved 
on a binding basis by the General Shareholders' Meeting 
on March 31, 2023 (the link to this policy can be found in 
section 5.1.3) according to the article 529 Novodecies of 
the Corporate Enterprises Act.
There have been no deviations from the procedure for 
the application of the Remuneration Policy in force at any 
given time, nor have any temporary exceptions to it been 
applied.
In this respect, the remuneration obtained in 2024 to the 
Executive Directors and the Directors in their positions as 
such consists of the same components as those 
described for the current Remuneration Policy in force in 
2025.
As indicated above, on 18 January 2025, the Board of 
Directors of Telefónica agreed to terminate the contract 
signed with Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete as Executive 
Chairman of the Board of Directors of Telefónica. 
Therefore, Mr. Álvarez-Pallete held the position of 
Executive Chairman for the entire year 2024 and, by 
virtue thereof, references to the Executive Chairman in 
this section regarding the application of the 2024 
Remuneration Policy refer to Mr. José María Álvarez-
Pallete.
The detailed description of the Directors’ remuneration 
system for 2024 was included in section 5.1.4 of the 
Annual Report on Remuneration of the Directors for 
2023. This report was approved by 88.49% of the votes 
cast, with a 4.13% of votes against and 7.38% abstentions.

The Executive Directors' remuneration in 2024 
• The Fixed Remuneration of the Executive Chairman 
(Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete López) in 2024 
remained unchanged since 2013 when he was 
appointed for his position as Chief Executive Officer 
and remained the same after his appointment as 
Chairman in 2016. In the case of the Chief Operating 
Officer, Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix, his amount remains 
unchanged since his appointment in 2017. 
• The Short-Term Variable Remuneration obtained by 
the Executive Directors amounted to 78.38% of the 
maximum amount.
• The weighted payout ratio of the Second cycle of the 
Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General 
Shareholders' Meeting in 2021 was 100%. This 
percentage is explained by the good performance of 
Telefónica's Free Cash Flow and Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) in the period 2022-2024, which was 
placed in the fourth position within the comparison 
group. In addition, Telefónica has met its Emission 
Neutralisation target.
• The total remuneration earned by Executive Directors 
is below the maximum remuneration established in 
the Remuneration Policy. Compared to 2023, it has 
increased by 3%.
The evolution of the main elements of Executive 
Directors' remuneration in recent years is detailed below:

A. FIXED REMUNERATION 
The Executive Chairman (Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete 
López): €1,923,100. 
In case of the Executive Chairman, the amount of his 
Fixed Remuneration in 2024 was the same as that paid 
since 2013, which was determined in his position as Chief 
Operating Officer, which remained the same after his 
appointment as Chairman in 2016. 
The Chief Operating Officer (Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix): 
€1,600,000. 
This remuneration is the same as the amount paid when 
Mr. Vilá was appointed as the company’s Chief Operating 
Officer on 26 July 2017.
B. SHORT-TERM VARIABLE REMUNERATION
The Executive Chairman (Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete 
López): €3,513,504.
Calculated as the fixed remuneration (€1,923,100) 
multiplied by the Maximum Amount (233.1%) multiplied 
by the weighted pay coefficient (78.38%). 
The Chief Operating Officer (Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix): 
€2,436,000.
Calculated as the fixed remuneration (€1,600,000) 
multiplied by the Maximum Amount (194.25%) multiplied 
by the weighted pay coefficient (78.38%). 
For fiscal year 2024, the Board of Directors approved, 
according to a proposal made by the NCCGC, the 
quantifiable and measurable metrics that best reflected 
the levers for creating value for the Telefónica Group 
with the aim of guaranteeing fulfilment of its strategy. 
These metrics and their relative weightings are the 
following:

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the metric used to measure our environmental 
impact. This is measured through direct and indirect CO2 emissions from the daily activity of 
Telefónica.
CO2 emission = Activity Data x Emission Factor
- Activity data: The amount of energy, fuel, gas, etc. consumed by the Company.
- Emission Factor: The amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by the consumption of 
each activity unit.
For electricity, the emission factor provided by official sources (European Union, Ministries, 
CNMC, etc.) is used and for fuels the GHG Protocol emission factors and the IPCC 
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations). Constant emission 
factors are used for the annual remuneration in order to avoid variations due to causes 
beyond the Company's control.

GENDER 
EQUALITY
(% of Women in 
executive 
positions)
The percentage of women among executive positions in the Telefónica Group is the metric 
used to measure the objective related to Gender Equality. It is measured on the total of the 
Telefónica Group Managers in the workforce at the end of December. The executive 
positions group is defined according to the criteria and processes determined by the People 
area at a corporate level. Prior to validation by the NCCGC, there is a Transparency and 
Diversity Committee, made up of the Chairman and four members of the Executive 
Committee, which validates, on a monthly basis, the proposals for appointments from this 
group to ensure compliance with the measures and policies established in the area of 
transparency and gender equality.

Throughout the year, the NCCGC monitored such 
objectives set for the Short-Term Variable Remuneration 
in 2024, payable in 2025.
The aforementioned objectives were finally assessed 
based on the audited accounts for the fiscal year 2024, 
according to the following process: 
1. The results for the fiscal year 2024 and the level of 
achievement of the objectives were firstly examined by 
the Audit and Control Committee, based on the results 
audited by PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS 
AUDITORES, S.L.
2. After this examination, the NCCGC determined a 
proposal for the Short-Term Variable Remuneration 
that was submitted to the Board of Directors. The 
Committee also considered the quality of the long-
term results and any associated risk in the proposal for 
variable remuneration.
3. Lastly, the Board of Directors approved the proposal 
for the Short-term Variable Remuneration submitted 
by the NCCGC. As a result of the foregoing, and 
according to that stipulated in recommendation 59 of 
the Good Governance Code, the Board agreed to pay 
the Executive Directors during the first quarter of 2025 
the amounts set out below, based on the following 
levels of achievement:

*The KPI for climate change, GHG emissions, has an inverse payout curve, 
meaning that achievements below 100% (emissions level lower than the 
target) are positive and result in payouts above 100%.
After applying the performance scales for each of the 
objectives, a weighted payment coefficient of 100% has 
been determined against the Target Amount. This 
payment coefficient corresponds to €3,513,504 for the 
Executive Chairman (78.38% of the Maximum Amount) 
and €2,436,000 for the Chief Operating Officer (78.38% 
of the Maximum Amount). The Short-Term Variable 
Remuneration target was 180% of the Annual Fixed 
Remuneration for the Executive Chairman (Mr. José 
María Álvarez-Pallete López) and 150% of the Annual 
Fixed Remuneration for the Chief Operating Officer (Mr. 
Ángel Vilá Boix).
C. LONG-TERM VARIABLE REMUNERATION 
Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the General 
Shareholders' Meeting of 2021. Accrual of the 
Second Cycle (2022-2024).
The General Shareholders’ Meeting held in 2021 
approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan consisting of 
providing Telefónica, S.A.’s shares, aimed at Executives of 
Telefónica that, meeting the requirements stipulated for 
such purpose from time to time, were invited to 
participate therein, including the Executive Directors de 
Telefónica, S.A. 
The performance period for the objectives of the first 
cycle of the Plan ended on December 31, 2024. The 
theoretical number of granted shares, corresponding to 
the Executive Directors, if 100% of the TSR, Free Cash 
Flow and Neutralization of CO2 emissions objectives are 
achieved, was as follows:
• The Executive Chairman (Mr. José María Álvarez-
Pallete López): 995,000 shares.
• The Chief Operating Officer (Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix).: 
745,000 shares.
In order to determine the correct number of shares to be 
granted at the end of the aforementioned cycle, the 
NCCGC analysed the level of achievement of each of the 
three objectives.

obtained by certain companies belonging to the 
telecommunications sector, weighted according to their 
relevance for Telefónica. 
Telefónica's TSR for the period was 33.6%, ranking fourth 
in the comparison group, that is, above the 75th 
percentile according to the established achievement 
scale. Therefore, the right to receive 100% of the shares 
linked to the achievement of the Relative TSR target has 
been generated.
Regarding the Free Cash Flow, weight of which is of 40%, 
the Planning and Supervision Department drew up a 
report related to the Free Cash Flow generated by the 
Telefónica Group in each year in the objective 
performance period (2022, 2023 and 2024), based on the 
results audited by the company’s internal and external 
auditors, comparing it with the value set in the budgets 
approved by the Board of Directors for each fiscal year. 
The final performance was considered as the average of 
the partial annual results obtained and approved by the 
NCCGC.
The NCCGC has been conducting annual monitoring of 
the Free Cash Flow and the level of performance is 
determined once the report issued by the Planning and 
Supervision Department has been analysed. When 
conducting this assessment, the NCCGC was supported 
by the Audit and Supervisory Committee, which provides 
information about the results audited by the Company’s 
external auditor. 
In this respect, the annual achievement level of Free 
Cash Flow was 108.5% (year 2022), 106.9% (year 2023) 
and 102% (year 2024). Therefore, the payment coefficient 
linked to Free Cash Flow was 100%. 
In relation to the CO2 emissions Neutralization/offsetting 
objective, whose weighting is the remaining 10%, and 
which also measures the reduction of scope 1 + 2 
emissions, in line with the 1.5ºC scenario of the Paris 
Agreement (SBTi), and with the objective set by the 
Company to reach net zero emissions in 2040 and 
neutralize scope 1+2 emissions as of 2025 in our main 
markets. The Corporate Affairs and Sustainability 
Department prepared a report in relation to the 
neutralization/offsetting of CO2 emissions as of 
December 31, 2024, based on the results audited by the 
Company's internal and external auditor.
The NCCGC has been periodically monitoring the level of 
CO2 emissions neutralization/offsetting, and after 
analyzing the report of the Corporate Affairs and 
Sustainability Department, has determined the degree of 
achievement. In this evaluation function, the NCCGC has 
been supported by the Sustainability and Regulation 
Committee and the Audit and Control Committee. 
In this respect, the minimum CO2 emissions reduction 
underpinning that triggers the possibility of assessing the 
degree of compliance with the CO2 emissions 
neutralization/compensation target in the different 
markets has been met, which in this fiscal year was 72% 
above the target level and, therefore, the payment 
coefficient linked to CO2 emissions neutralization was 
100%.
Bearing in mind the results of the Relative TSR, the Free 
Cash Flow, and the neutralization of CO2 emission, the 
weighted payment coefficient amounted to 100% 
(745,00 shares for the Chief Operating Officer (Mr. Ángel 
Vilá Boix). This incentive will be delivered during March 
2025, once the 2024 financial statements have been 
prepared and audited, as established in recommendation 
59 of the CNMV's Good Governance Code for listed 
companies. 
In the case of Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete López, due 
to his termination as Executive Chairman, he will not 
receive the delivery in shares corresponding to this cycle 
but will receive an equivalent settlement in cash. 
Therefore, he will not be subject to the 2-year retention 
period.
In the case of the Chief Operating Officer, these shares 
will be subject to a two-year retention period, which may 
be increased to three years in the event that the 
executive director does not comply with the commitment 
to permanently hold shares.

of the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the 
General Shareholders' Meeting  of 2021 was settled, 
whose performance period covered the period 
2021-2023 and the incentive was linked to Relative TSR, 
Free Cash Flow and Neutralization of CO2 emissions. In 
this regard, considering that the weighted payment 
coefficient was 89.45%, 978,583 shares were paid to the 
Executive Chairman, Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete 
López, and 732,596 shares to the Chief Operating Officer, 
Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix.

Directors and Senior Executive Directors and designing 
new remuneration plans that enable the Company to 
attract, retain and motivate the most outstanding 
professionals, aligning their interests with the Company’s 
strategic objectives. 
In addition, other bodies and external advisors take part in 
the process of determining the Remuneration Policy.

involved in determining and approving the Remuneration 
Policy and its conditions are explained below, along with

Committee
Directors in their positions as such: It proposes the

Meeting, among the various items.
The Committee reviews the Directors’ remuneration 
on a regular basis to ensure that it is appropriate for 
the duties they perform.
Executive Directors:
• It proposes the fixed remuneration for the Executive 
Directors to the Board of Directors considering, 
among other factors, their level of responsibility and 
leadership within the organisation, promoting the 
retention of key staff, attracting top talent and 
creating sufficient economic independence to 
ensure a balance with the significance of other 
items included in the remuneration.
• It reviews, on an annual basis, the terms and 
conditions for the variable remuneration, including 
the structure and maximum levels of remuneration, 
the targets set and the weighting of each of them, 
taking into account the company's strategy, needs 
and business situation. These conditions are subject 
to the approval of the Board of Directors.
• It proposes the contracts to the Board of Directors 
that regulate the duties and responsibilities of the 
Executive Directors.
• It proposes the Annual Report on Remuneration of 
the Directors and the Remuneration Policy, when

General Shareholders' Meeting to which the Annual 
Report on Remuneration of the Directors for the 
previous year was submitted, in an advisory manner.
It proposes the objectives at the 
beginning of each performance period to 
the Board of Directors.
It assesses achievement of the targets at 
the end of the performance period. Since 
payment of the variable remuneration is 
subject to sufficient verification that the 
stipulated targets have effectively been 
achieved, as determined in 
recommendation 59 of the Good 
Governance Code, this assessment is 
carried out on the basis of the results 
audited by the Company's external and 
internal auditors, which are first analysed 
by the Audit and Supervisory Committee, 
as well as the level of achievement of the 
targets. In this respect, for the purpose of 
ensuring that there is an effective relation 
between the variable remuneration and 
the professional performance of the 
recipients thereof, any positive or 
negative economic impact caused by 
extraordinary events that could distort 
the findings of the assessments are 
disregarded.
Submits a report to the Board, when 
appropriate, on whether or not

associated risk in the proposed variable 
remuneration.
It proposes Annual Report on

executives and other employees in 
the organisation.
The criteria for conducting these 
analyses have been described in the 
previous section 5.1.4.

expense. In this respect, Towers Watson provided advice

Remuneration. Likewise, the law firm Garrigues took part 
in the review thereof.
5.1.9. Alignment of the remuneration 
system with the risk profile and with 
sustainable and long-term results
Telefónica’s Remuneration Policy has the following 
features that enable its exposure to excessive risks to be 
reduced and adjustment to the Company’s long-term 
objectives, values and interests:
Adopting measures related to the staff 
categories whose professional work has a 
significant impact on the Company’s risk profile 
• The NCCGC supervises the examination, analysis and 
application of the remuneration policy of the 
professionals whose work could have a significant 
impact on the Company’s risk profile.
• No guaranteed variable remuneration.

• The variable remuneration is only payable after the 
date the relevant annual accounts have been drawn 
up, once the achievement level of the operating and 
financial objectives can be determined.
• The NCCGC considers the quality of the results in the 
long-term and any associated risk in the evaluation 
process of variable remuneration. 
• The design of the Long-Term Incentive Plans, each one 
with three-year cycles, implies an interrelation with the 
results in each year, therefore acting as an alignment 
catalyst with the company’s long-term interests and 
cautious decision-making.
• The NCCGC is authorized to propose cancellation of 
payment of the variable remuneration to the Board of 
Directors under certain circumstances. Detailed 
information on this point can be found in section 5.1.6 of 
this report.
• The Company’s Audit and Supervisory Committee 
takes part in the decision-making process related to the 
Short-Term Variable Remuneration of the Executive 
Directors by verifying the economic-financial and non-
financial information that may be part of the objectives 
set for the purpose of such remuneration, as this 
Committee must first verify the company’s results as 
the basis for calculating the relevant objectives.
• The NCCGC is composed of 4 members, two of whom 
are also members on the Audit and Supervisory 
Committee. The fact that some Directors are members 
of these two Committees ensures that the risks related 
to remuneration are taken into account in the 
discussions held by both Committees and in their 
proposals submitted to the Board, both in the 
determination and assessment process of the annual 
and multi-year incentives.
• According to the Remuneration Policy, at the proposal 
of the NCCGC, the Board of Directors is authorized to 
agree on the possible revaluation or modification of the 
remuneration linked to the results if there are 
significant internal or external changes that mean they 
need to be reviewed.
• Regarding the measures required to avoid conflicts of 
interest by the directors, according to the provisions in 
the Spanish Capital Companies Act, the Regulations of 
Telefónica’s Board of Directors includes a series of 
obligations related to its duties of loyalty and to avoid 
situations of conflict of interest. Moreover, the 
NCCGC’s Regulations determine that one of its duties 
is to ensure that possible conflicts of interest do not 
harm the independence of the external advice provided 
to the Committee.
Consistency with the Company’s strategy and 
focus on achieving results in the long-term 
The design of the remuneration policy, consistent with 
the Company’s strategy and aimed at obtaining long-
term results, is as follows: 
The total remuneration for the Executive Directors and 
Senior Executives consists of various remunerative 
components, mainly composed of the following: (i) Fixed 
Remuneration, (ii) Short-term Variable Remuneration and 
(iii) Long-term Variable Remuneration. In the case of the 
Executive Directors, under normal conditions, at the date 
of the grant this long-term component accounts for a 
weight of on the date such General no less than 30% of 
their total remuneration in a scenario of standard 
achievement of objectives (fixed + short-term variable + 
long-term variable).
The Long-Term Variable Remuneration plans are part of a 
multi-annual framework in order to ensure that the 
assessment process is based on long-term profits and 
that the company’s underlying economic cycle is taken 
into account. This remuneration is allocated and paid in 
the form of shares based on the creation of value, so that 
the Executives’ interests are in line with those of the 
shareholders. In addition, they are overlapping cycles that 
generally follow one another indefinitely over time, with a 
permanent focus on the long-term in all decision-making. 
Furthermore, two members of the NCCGC also serve on 
the Regulation and Sustainability Committee. The cross-
presence of Board members in these two Committees 
ensures the consideration of sustainability in the realm of 
remunerations.

C.2 Indicate the evolution in the last five years of the amount and percentage variation of the remuneration accrued by each of the directors of the listed 
company who have held this position during the year, the consolidated results of the company and the average remuneration on an equivalent basis with regard 
to full-time employees of the company and its subsidiaries that are not directors of the listed company.
OBSERVATIONS TO THE % VARIATION 2024/2023:
• The increase in the total remuneration of Mr. José María Álvarez-Pallete López and Mr. Ángel Vilá Boix in 2024 is 3%, considering the fixed remuneration and the remuneration 
whose performance period concluded in 2023 and 2024, notwithstanding that the payment occurred in the years 2024 and 2025, respectively.
• The variation shown in the following table for 2024 with respect to 2023 responds to the criteria communicated by the CNMV to Telefónica in relation to the reporting of Long-
Term Variable Remuneration amounts. In this regard, the CNMV considers that the shares delivered in the current year should be reported as consolidated financial 
instruments, notwithstanding the fact that the target measurement period ended in the previous year. Therefore, in the 2023 remuneration, the shares of the Long-Term 
Variable Remuneration whose cycle had a 2020-2022 measurement period are being included as consolidated financial instruments, instead of the cycle with a 2021-2023 
measurement period, and in the 2024 remuneration, the shares of the Long-Term Variable Remuneration whose cycle had a 2021-2023 measurement period are being 
included as consolidated financial instruments. In this regard, it should be noted that the 2020-2022 cycle was particular due to the fact that the grant value of the incentive 
was 50% lower than that of a standard cycle. Additionally, the payment coefficient of the aforementioned cycle amounted to 50%. Therefore, the gross number of shares finally 
delivered in the 2020-2022 cycle amounted to 25% of what would be a standard maximum incentive.

Credit risk management
The Telefónica Group considers customer credit risk 
management as a key element to achieve its business 
and customer base growth targets in a sustainable way. 
This management approach relies on the active 
evaluation of the risk-reward balance within the 
commercial operations and on the adequate separation 
between the risk ownership and risk management 
functions.
Formal delegation of authority procedures and 
management practices are implemented in the different 
Group companies, taking into account benchmark risk 
management techniques but adapted to the local 
characteristics of each market. Commercial debtors that 
may cause a relevant impact on the Telefónica Group 
consolidated financial statements and increased risk 
profile products - due to customer target, term, channels 
or other commercial characteristics - are subject to 
specific management practices in order to mitigate the 
exposure to credit risk. These procedures include:
• Statistical and expert models for customer acquisition 
that are used to forecast and to manage the customer 
expected probability of default.
• Decision tools allowing the implementation of tailored 
credit strategies by product, channel, geography and 
type of customer.
• Continuous monitoring of the payment behavior and 
solvency of the customer portfolio.
• Internal and external collection processes designed to 
increase recovery through differentiated actions by 
debt age and customer profile.
• Ongoing controls over the credit risk exposure. 
The customer credit risk management strategy is 
embedded in the day-to-day operational processes 
guiding both the product and services available for the 
different customer profile and the management 
practices all through the customer life-cycle.
Credit rating
At December 31, 2024, Telefónica, S.A.’s long-term issuer 
default rating is "BBB stable outlook" from Fitch, “BBB- 
stable outlook" from Standard & Poor's and “Baa3 stable 
outlook" from Moody's. During this year, there have not 
been changes in the long-term credit ratings by any of 
the three agencies. Last changes in the credit ratings 
took place in 2020 when Standard and Poor’s revised 
the outlook to “negative“ from “stable” on April 1, 2020 
and later, on November 20, 2020 downgraded the rating 
to “BBB - stable” from “BBB negative”. On November 7, 
2016 Moody's downgraded the rating to “Baa3 stable” 
from “Baa2 negative” and on September 5, 2016 Fitch 
downgraded the rating to “BBB stable” from “BBB+ 
stable”.
 
In 2024, measures taken to protect the credit rating 
included an active portfolio management through the 
voluntary public acquisition offer for shares of Telefónica 
Deutschland that reinforces Telefónica’s strategy to 
focus on its core geographies and its strong 
commitment to the German market, one of the most 
attractive and stable telecom markets in Europe. The 
offer also supports Telefónica’s efforts to simplify the 
Group’s structure and enhances the euro-denominated 
cash flows generated in the Group.
Telefónica has also undertaken an employee’s 
restructuring process, allowing the capture of savings 
and with a positive cash generation impact from 2024 
and Telefónica España has reached an agreement with 
Vodafone España to incorporate a joint company, whose 
main activity is the commercialization of a fiber to the 
home network for its shareholders.
In addition, Telefonica maintains a solid liquidity position 
and conservative approach to debt refinancing, as the 
Group took advantage of the historical low refinancing 
rates to extend average debt life and smooth its maturity 
profile in coming years. 
Dividend policy
Telefónica establishes the shareholder remuneration 
policy taking into account the Group’s earnings, cash 
generation, solvency, liquidity, flexibility to make 
strategic investments, and shareholders and investors’ 
expectations.
On March 2017 the Board of Directors of Telefónica, S.A. 
decided to define the corresponding payment periods of 
the dividends. Therefore, from there on, the dividend 
payment in the second quarter will take place in June, 
and the dividend payment in the fourth quarter will take 
place in December, in both cases on or before the third

policy for the year 2022, which consists of an amount of 
0.30 euros per share in cash, payable in December 2022 
(0.15 euros per share) and in June 2023 (0.15 euros per

6.2. Treasury shares
Telefónica has performed, and may consider performing, 
transactions with treasury shares and financial 
instruments or contracts that confer the right to acquire 
treasury shares or assets whose underlying is Company 
shares.
Treasury share transactions will always be for legitimate 
purposes, including: 
• Undertaking treasury share acquisitions approved by 
the Board of Directors or pursuant to General 
Shareholders' Meeting resolutions. 
• Honoring previous legitimate commitments assumed. 
• Covering requirements for shares to allocate to 
employees and management under stock option 
plans. 
• Other purposes in accordance with prevailing 
legislation. In the past, treasury shares purchased on 
the stock market were exchanged for other shares-
securities (as in the case of preferred capital 
securities), swapped for stakes in other companies 
(e.g. the share exchange with KPN) acquired to reduce 
the number of shares in circulation (by redeeming the 
shares acquired), thereby boosting earnings per share, 
the delivery of treasury shares in exchange for the 
acquisition of a stake in another company (such as the 
agreement with Prosegur Compañía de Seguridad, 
S.A.). 
Treasury share transactions will not be performed in any 
event based on privileged information or in order to 
intervene in free price formation. In particular, any of the 
conduct referred to in Articles 83.ter.1 of the Spanish 
Securities Market Law and 2 of Royal Decree 1333/2005 
of November 11 implementing the Spanish Securities 
Market Law, with regards to market abuse will be 
avoided.

instruments" of the Consolidated Annual Accounts for 
the year ended December 31, 2024.

telecommunications services offered by Telefónica. A 
single fixed customer may contract for multiple services, 
and Telefónica believes that it is more useful to count 
the number of accesses a customer has contracted for, 
rather than to merely count the number of its customers. 
For example, a customer that has fixed line telephony 
service and broadband service is counted as two 
accesses rather than as one customer. 
"ARPU" is total mobile service revenues during the 
relevant period divided by the average number of retail 
accesses (based on the beginning and the month-end 
number of retail accesses during such period), divided

delivering television programming to consumers via 
radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial 
cables, or in more recent systems, via light pulses
