Dear Readers,
Between war, inflation, and natural disasters, 2023 was another 
crisis-filled year. Exactly one year ago, this was where I wrote: “the 
future is becoming more difficult rather than easier. So let’s make 
the most of the opportunities we have to take action, and let’s stay 
optimistic.”
It is becoming harder and harder to stay optimistic in the face of 
everything that is happening in the world. However, we cannot 
allow the weight of this to overwhelm us into inaction – not as 
individuals, not as a company, and not as a society.
We as Telekom also have a very clear position. We speak up when-
ever individuals use the digital space to spread hate speech. At the 
start of the year, we published the new “Lights on!” campaign 
video as part of our “No hate speech” initiative. The video calls for 
democratic solidarity in society.
Yes, the challenges we face are complex and intertwined. And sim-
ple answers are therefore attractive to many. But I firmly believe 
we can find effective solutions together that are better. For this to 
happen, however, we need to learn to be more honest with each 
other and allow the big picture to emerge. We mustn’t only talk 
about our successes. We have to be honest about our challenges 
and – where necessary – also about our failures, embracing an 
attitude of “radical transparency.”
This is key when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), for example. 
We must seize the opportunities offered by AI, but without ignor-
ing the risks. For me, providing full information is an integral part of 
using AI responsibly. I am convinced that the best strategy when it 
comes to dealing with new technologies is to promote media liter-
acy. In 2023, we used our “A message from Ella” video to draw 
attention to the damage deepfakes can cause if we are not careful 
to use our personal information and images of our children respon-
sibly. However, we mustn’t let this put us off grasping the endless 
potential offered by AI. AI and digitalization will play a huge part in 
solving social and ecological problems around the world, and will 
ultimately be a major factor in our future economic growth.
We also prioritize transparency when it comes to climate protec-
tion. At Deutsche Telekom, we have set ourselves a vital target of 
achieving net zero emissions along our entire value chain by 2040. 
We have drawn up a transition plan for our journey to that goal that 
is designed to create transparency both within the company and 
externally, setting out what we have achieved in terms of climate 
protection and which activities have still to be launched. 
To this end, we started incorporating Scope 1 and Scope 2 green-
house gas emissions into our financial planning process in 2022. 
From 2024, we also intend to take account of Scope 3 emissions in 
this – that is to say, the greenhouse gas emissions that are gener-
ated in the supply chain and during use by our customers.
Any organization that lobbies for transparency must also be willing 
to have its own targets and activities audited by independent 
experts on a regular basis. The gold standard for climate protec-
tion is the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This organization 
checks whether companies’ climate goals are in line with the latest 
climate research and contribute to compliance with the Paris 
Agreement. Our ambitious climate targets have been confirmed 
by SBTi experts. I am delighted that this makes us the first DAX 
heavyweight to receive such a validation of its long-term and net 
zero climate targets.
At Deutsche Telekom, responsibility for sustainability – and there-
fore also climate protection – lies with the Group Board of Man-
agement. All Board of Management departments are involved in 
equal measure when it comes to launching the necessary activities 
and investments and providing the required impetus to our deci-
sions. This enables us to continue driving forward greener innova-
tions and products. However, sustainability must become an even 
more integral part of our core business – for me, that also belongs 
to the concept of “radical transparency.”

Worldwide, Deutsche Telekom employees ensure that our net-
works operate smoothly and that our customers receive the best 
service – and they implement our sustainability strategy in all 
departments with determination. I would like to offer my sincere 
gratitude to all our staff for this. Thanks to their commitment and 
our operational performance, we made it into the top 10 most val-
uable brands in the world in 2023 – in fact, we are number one 
among the telecommunication companies. We also remain the 
most valuable corporate brand in Europe. This makes me proud, 
and it shows that we are heading in the right direction together.
And we will continue down the same road. We have set ourselves 
the goal of becoming the world’s leading digital and sustainable 
telecommunications company. This sustainability report contains 
comprehensive information about where we stand as at 2023 and 
what we are planning for the future.
One last thought – being transparent and calling out challenges is 
only ever the first step. The real work comes after. Finding solu-
tions means finding the courage for open dialog, even beyond the 
boundaries of a company. Let’s all dare to be more transparent!
Best regards,
Tim Höttges

CR strategy
Sustainability and social responsibility have been firm components 
of our corporate activities for more than two decades. We see our-
selves as a responsible company and have enshrined this in our 
Group strategy. As such, we are committed to implementing sus-
tainability along our value chain – and to playing an important role 
in meeting today’s environmental, economic, and social chal-
lenges.
You can find additional information on our Group strategy in the 
2023 Annual Report.
Our CR (Corporate Responsibility) strategy is derived from the 
Group strategy. It focuses on four key areas as well as good corpo-
rate governance in which we want to act as a role model:
1. Our strict commitment to climate-neutral business practices: 
We want to play a pioneering role on the way to a climate-neutral 
future and enable our customers and society as a whole to com-
plete this journey together with us by 2040. We want to cut emis-
sions by at least 90 percent, with only up to 10 percent being off-
set.
2. Our determined efforts to ensure our products and services are 
compatible with the circular economy: We want to make almost all 
of our technologies and devices compatible with a circular econ-
omy across the entire value chain by 2030.
3. Our pursuit of diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as our 
investment in training for our employees: We want to provide a 
safe, supportive environment where we promote equity among 
people – across all dimensions of diversity.
4. Our determination to help shape a digital society that is based 
on fundamental democratic values and in which all people can 
participate safely, competently, and with autonomy: We want to 
make the digital world a tolerant, safe space for everyone and ena-
ble society to bridge the digital divide.
All strategic pillars must be based on sound governance, which for 
us encompasses a whole range of very different but equally impor-
tant issues:
	
Data protection, cybersecurity, and information security
	
A dependable corporate compliance and risk management 
system
	
Application of the basic principles of digital responsibility
	
Respect for human rights and the sustainable development of 
supply chains
	
Investment based on environmental and social criteria and 
transparent communication about our activities in terms of 
ecological and social sustainability
	
An effective management structure for sustainability issues in 
the Group

Sustainability targets in remuneration
Our investments in the network build-out make us one of the big-
gest investors in the industry. In 2023, we invested more than EUR 
16 billion Group-wide, primarily in building and operating net-
works to meet the growing demand for faster, full-coverage data 
services. However, the network build-out is not to lead to an 
increase in CO₂ emissions and thus accelerate climate change. For 
this reason, we use energy from renewable sources to decouple 
CO₂ emissions from energy consumption. In Europe, we have set 
ourselves the goal of doubling the energy efficiency of our net-
works by the end of 2024. Above and beyond this, we want to fur-
ther increase energy efficiency – for instance at our data centers – 
and thus reduce energy consumption in the medium term despite 
the expected rise in data consumption (2024 against 2020, goal 
excludes T‑Mobile US). The two non-financial performance indica-
tors “energy consumption” and “CO₂ emissions” (Scope 1 and 2) 
were incorporated into the variable component of our Board of 
Management’s remuneration in 2021, and in 2022 were also made 
relevant for our international executives (excluding T‑Mobile US), 
as well as all employees in Germany not covered by collective 
agreements.
In the United States, we are forging ahead with the highly intensive 
build-out of our 5G network, in particular in rural areas. This initially 
drives up power consumption. T‑Mobile US, like the Group as a 
whole, has covered 100 percent of its electricity requirements 
from renewable energy sources since 2021. There are fluctuations 
in T‑Mobile US’ Scope 1 carbon footprint owing to unforeseeable 
natural disasters and the associated temporary use of equipment 
such as diesel generators to restore and back up damaged net-
work infrastructure. Consideration must be given to the special 
national situation in this key market, which is why the decision was 
taken not to include T‑Mobile US in these two non-financial perfor-
mance indicators in respect of short-term variable remuneration. 
This step ensures that the right incentives are set for the Board of 
Management, executives, and all employees in Germany not cov-
ered by collective agreements toward the sustainable develop-
ment of the business, while at the same time safeguarding the sta-
bility of network operations.
The annual ambition for the performance indicators “energy con-
sumption” and “CO₂ emissions” (Scope 1 and 2) will continue to be 
set, managed, and reported for the entire Group as before, includ-
ing a target value for T‑Mobile US. Energy consumption for the 
Group as a whole in the reporting year was down slightly year-on-
year at 12 241 GWh (prior year: 13 253 GWh). Due in particular to 
the Group-wide use of electricity from renewable energy sources, 
CO₂ emissions (Scope 1 and 2) are at a low level and dropped fur-
ther as a result of our measures to 217 kt CO₂e (prior year: 233 kt 
CO₂e). The values given for total energy consumption and Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions are based in part on estimates, assump-
tions, and extrapolations, and, in part, on data provided by our 
external energy service providers.

Corporate Digital Responsibility
Day in and day out, we see our world changing, at ever-faster 
rates. Computers, smartphones, and artificial intelligence (AI) now 
play indispensable roles in our daily lives. Most of the time, they 
help us without our even noticing their operation. All of this is the 
beginning of a development that we can no longer stop – and that 
we don’t want to stop. All enthusiasm notwithstanding, however, 
we shouldn’t head into the digital future blindly. As we move for-
ward, we should seek to define a clear direction and a binding 
framework for that future. We at Deutsche Telekom are working to 
bring about digitalization oriented toward people and values. “Cor-
porate digital responsibility” (CDR) refers to efforts to manage the 
opportunities and risks of the digital transformation responsibly. 
The goals of our CDR activities are twofold: to prevent negative 
impacts, and to help shape the digitalization process in a positive 
way.
Throughout our CDR work, we take great care to ensure that all 
processing of our customers’ personal data is carried out transpar-
ently and responsibly, in ways that also safeguard individual cus-
tomers’ privacy and security. Further information about this area is 
available in our publications on data privacy, in our status report 
on data privacy, and in our transparency report. Also, in our Digital 
Ethics Guidelines on AI, we describe our responsible use of AI in 
connection with our products and services.
Digital participation is a core aspect of our commitment. We are 
working to ensure that all people have equal opportunity to be a 
part of the digital society. Our focuses in this regard include the 
technical aspects of broadband access, rates and devices that are 
affordable for all budgets, and users’ ability and desire to use digi-
tal media competently. For example, we carry out a variety of pro-
jects and implement measures to promote media literacy and 
democracy skills among the population.
Upholding of human rights is a key element of responsible digitali-
zation. We strive always to protect and respect human rights in 
regard to the responsibilities that emerge as a result of technologi-
cal change and the digital transformation. Our objective is for our 
technology to be implemented on the basis of humanitarian val-
ues. We have also anchored the principle of digital responsibility 
and participation in our Code of Human Rights, which we updated 
in 2023. This code applies not only to our company, but also to our 
business partners – and to our approximately 20 000 suppliers in 
over 150 countries. We expressly require our suppliers to join us in 
our responsibility, with a view to ensuring that human rights are 
also respected within the sphere of influence that we have outside 
of our Group.
Digital responsibility is also highly important with regard to envi-
ronmental and climate-protection issues. By developing products 
that are innovative and sustainable, we help our customers reduce 
their own carbon footprints – and thereby contribute to climate 
protection. In addition, to help our customers find sustainable 
solutions, we highlight products and services that are environmen-
tally and climate friendly. We do this with our TÜV-verified 
#GreenMagenta Label (for products and services) and our Eco 
Rating scheme (for mobile devices). Our “Smart Innovations” also

contribute to society’s efforts to improve its ecological balance.
Digitalization is opening up new ways and possibilities for working. 
We are helping to shape the digital transformation in the work-
place, in a responsible manner, and we are continuing to support 
our employees in addressing the challenges the transformation 
has brought. We are reinforcing our employees’ digital skills with a 
range of measures, including the WeLearn training initiative and 
the Percipio and “Learning from experts” (LEX) training packages. 
In addition, in close consultation with our Group Works Council, we 
have adopted a “Manifesto on Agile Working,” a set of guidelines 
for the digital workplace.
Our definition of digital responsibility
Technological development must be based on values. We see our-
selves as having a responsibility to implement ethics within tech-
nologies and to make technologies accessible to everyone. In 
2022, we published our Corporate Digital Responsibility@
Deutsche Telekom framework, which summarizes our views of dig-
ital responsibility. We make people the priority. The centerpiece of 
the framework is our House of Digital Responsibility, which is all 
about people-centric technology.
Our CDR framework and our House of Digital Responsibility are 
both based on our guiding principles. The foundation of this basis 
is the commitment to act in accordance with laws and regulations, 
with human rights, and with basic values such as cultural values. 
Conceptually, we place a number of key areas on this foundation – 
digital ethics, digital participation, the future of work, and climate 
protection and resources conservation. These key areas serve as 
orientational aids for our activities. The foundation and all of these 
areas, in turn, are housed under the umbrella of principles that 
constantly guide our efforts, namely data privacy and security, and 
transparency and dialog.
Outside of our own corporate sphere, our efforts and commit-
ments in this area include active involvement in various alliances 
and partnerships, such as the BVDW (German Association for the 
Digital Economy), econsense, a network of internationally operat-
ing companies, and the Charta für digitale Vernetzung (Digital net-
working charter; only available in German). In addition, we are a 
member of the Corporate Digital Responsibility initiative of the 
German Federal Ministry of Justice. In 2021, we signed the Initia-
tive’s CDR Codex, thereby committing ourselves to observe a set 
of concrete principles and to regularly publish a relevant progress 
report. We published this report for the reporting year in July 
2023.
CR controlling: measuring and managing sustainability
Our CR controlling ensures that we can collect ESG data and KPIs 
transparently, and in a timely manner, and report them in the 
“Management & Facts” section and the interactive KPI tool of this 
CR report.
We record ESG data as part of our CR controlling and reporting 
activities. We use this data to calculate our ESG KPIs, which we use 
to measure and manage our CR performance. The non-financial 
performance indicators “energy consumption” and “CO₂ emis-
sions” (Scope 1 and 2) that are relevant for remuneration are 
essential elements of the Group’s higher-level controlling pro-
cesses. This also applies to other ESG KPIs, such as the Energy 
Intensity ESG KPI and the Sustainable Packaging and Return of 
Devices circular economy KPIs. Alongside the ESG KPIs, we also 
report other metrics and data with the aim of meeting internal and 
external transparency requirements.
In addition, we have developed an impact assessment method 
that allows us to measure and evaluate the environmental and 
social impact of selected products, solutions, and measures along 
the value chain. This helps us to keep our key sustainability activi-
ties results-oriented, to provide transparent reporting on them, 
and to demonstrate how our business activities are contributing to 
the achievement of the SDGs, for example.
We have been integrating our ESG data process incrementally in 
our ICS (internal control system) since 2021. This was initially 
comprised of specific ICS principles aimed at achieving a high 
level of data quality, timeliness, and transparency. These principles 
cover decentralized, system-based ESG data processes that are 
aggregated at the Group level. In as early as 2022, we supple-
mented the ICS principles with more demanding transaction-level 
controls for the remuneration-relevant KPIs. These transaction-
level controls are reviewed internally and, in some cases, exter-
nally.
We are continuously improving our performance indicator system 
on the basis of internal and external requirements. We have added 
additional KPIs for the areas of resource conservation and circular 
economy since 2021, so we can coordinate and communicate our 
progress in this strategic area even more precisely. Trends in the 
ESG KPIs over the past four years can be seen here. In the report-
ing year, KPIs in the interactive benchmarking tool were, for the 
first time, broken down into the following segments: Germany, 
United States, Europe, Systems Solutions, Group Headquarters & 
Group Services, Group Development, and Technology and Innova-
tion.

Our management tools: the ESG key performance indicators
ESG KPIs (key performance indicators) are used as management 
tools for our CR activities. Since they are highly relevant, we also 
publish them in the combined non-financial statement of our 
annual report.
The segments assist in the collection of Group-wide ESG KPIs by 
recording CR data themselves. They and their national companies 
represent 99 percent of the Group’s revenue.
For the purpose of integrated financial and sustainability reporting, 
the KPIs map all six types of capital (see diagram).

Business activities and organization
Our website presents a description of our business activities, and 
our 2023 Annual Report includes detailed information about the 
development of our business.
Our Group is structured into five operating segments and the 
Group Headquarters & Group Services segment. Our Technology 
and Innovation Board of Management department also unites the 
cross-segment technology, innovation, IT, and security functions of 
our Germany, Europe, and Systems Solutions segments. All seg-
ments are broken down individually in the interactive benchmark-
ing tool. The following four operating segments make the biggest 
contribution to the development of sustainability in the Group and 
are therefore also addressed in separate sections of the report.

Our Germany operating segment comprises all fixed-network 
and mobile business activities for consumers and business 
customers, including separate sales entities in Germany to 
allow a customer-centric sales approach. As a pioneer of digi-
talization, the segment offers a tailored service and product 
portfolio that is designed to be innovative while at the same 
time secure and simple. The bundling of our sales and service 
business within Sales & Service places a further focus on cus-
tomer experience and on customer satisfaction. The Wholesale 
business delivers wholesale telecommunication services for 
third-party telecommunications companies. The build-out of 
the mobile and fixed networks in Germany is managed by the 
Technology business unit.

Our United States operating segment combines all mobile 
activities in the U.S. market. T Mobile US provides service, 
devices, and accessories across its flagship brands. In addition, 
it sells devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for 
resale. It provides wireless communications services through a 
variety of service plan options to U.S. domestic customers, 
including plans marketed to businesses. T Mobile US also 
offers a wide selection of wireless devices, including smart-
phones, wearables, tablets, home broadband routers, and other 
mobile communication devices that are manufactured by vari-
ous suppliers. In addition to its wireless communications ser-
vices, it offers High Speed Internet utilizing its nationwide 5G 
network. It also provides products that are complementary to 
its wireless communications services, including device protec-
tion and wireline communication services. On May 1, 2023, T 
Mobile US closed the sale of its Wireline Business.

Our Europe operating segment comprises all fixed-network 
and mobile operations of the national companies in Greece, 
Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Slovakia, Austria, 
North Macedonia, and Montenegro. In these countries, we are 
an integrated provider of telecommunications services. In 
Romania, our focus is on mobile communications. Besides tra-
ditional B2C fixed-network and mobile business, most of our 
national companies also offer ICT solutions for business cus-
tomers.

Our Systems Solutions operating segment offers B2B IT ser-
vices in the core market of Western Europe under the T Sys-
tems brand. T Systems primarily addresses the IT growth areas 
of advisory, cloud services, and digitalization with a corre-
sponding portfolio of products and solutions. We consider data 
sovereignty and security solutions to be the most attractive 
growth areas in the IT market, which is why we include them as 
integral components of our portfolio, enhanced by strategic 
partnerships. The services penetrate deep into the value chains 
of selected industries (automotive, healthcare, public sector, 
and transportation). As part of our transformation program, we 
have been working since 2018 to realign both our organization 
and our workflows, and make adjustments to our capacities. 
We now comprise four portfolio areas: Cloud, Digital, Security 
(in close collaboration with Deutsche Telekom Security), and 
Advisory (together with Detecon as an advisory partner). In 
addition, our Road User Services business unit offers road toll 
systems.
We are convinced that commercial, social, and ecological aspects 
can complement each other. We aim to make a positive contribu-
tion to sustainable development throughout our entire value chain.

advises and oversees the Board of Management in this task. The 
Group Corporate Responsibility (GCR) department develops 
Group-wide policies and guidelines with the goal of steadily 
advancing the corporate culture with regard to sustainable innova-
tion, environmentally friendly business practices, and social 
responsibility. Since 2022, the Chair of the Board of Management 
has been responsible for GCR. By allocating responsibility in this 
way and incorporating ESG targets into Board of Management 
remuneration in 2021, the Supervisory Board and Board of Man-
agement highlighted the great importance that Corporate 
Responsibility has for our Group. CR controlling provides support 
through shared services with Deutsche Telekom Services Europe 
(DTSE) in consolidating ESG data and key figures comprehensively 
and integrating them centrally into the financial and management 
systems. The Board of Management is informed every quarter 
about the status of the most important sustainability KPIs in the 
Group Performance Report. The Supervisory Board is also regu-
larly updated by GCR about the sustainability strategy and the 
progress that has been made in implementing it. Furthermore, a 
training workshop on the role of the Supervisory Board as part of 
new sustainability requirements was held in 2023. In the year 
under review, the members of the Board of Management dis-
cussed sustainability indicators and decided on the future devel-
opment of individual topics in a variety of dialog formats. Addition-
ally, the Global CR Board was realigned in the reporting year as a 
Group-wide committee and preparatory body for the Board of 
Management.
The different Group business units and segments are responsible 
for implementing the CR strategy. In 2023, the same kind of com-
pany management structure as is used in the headquarters was 
established in the segments. Overarching responsibility for a seg-
ment now lies with the segment management team. This manage-
ment team delegates the tasks of adapting content and managing 
implementation in relation to the Group sustainability strategy to 
CR segment leads. The CR segment controller helps to develop 
the processes for recording, consolidating, and analyzing the ESG 
KPIs and helps to shape the management measures based on 
these KPIs. These functions supplement and reinforce the existing 
network of CR managers in the Group’s legal entities. To coordi-
nate their tasks and learn from each other, CR managers and 
employees from CR-relevant functions across the Group collabo-
rate in an international network under the leadership of GCR. Dur-
ing the year under review, this network included employees from 
around 52 companies in 29 different countries. Participants can 
exchange ideas and experience in relation to best practices and 
undertake training in the form of themed deep dives. The first in-
person network meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic was held 
in 2023 and addressed focal points of the strategic roadmap for 
the current year. The roadmap includes switching the fleets over to 
electromobility, tackling challenges associated with Scope 3 emis-
sions, enhancing the coordination of social commitment on an 
international level, implementing the Design for All project, and 
preparing for CSRD-compliant reporting from reporting year 2024.
Our CR Policy provides the formal, mandatory framework for the 
sustainability management activities at all Group units at a global 
level. In 2022, in a move designed to further shore up the imple-
mentation of our CR ambitions throughout the organization, we 
extensively developed the CR Policy that has been in place since 
2017. Following its approval by the Board of Management in Feb-
ruary 2023, we launched a process to enforce the updated version 
throughout the Group. At the end of 2023, the CR Policy had been 
enforced at 75 of 135 Group companies; the rollout will be contin-
ued in 2024. The CR managers in the individual segments and 
legal units are involved in the ratification of the CR Policy in the 
Group’s subsidiaries. As soon as the CR Policy has been adopted in 
a legal entitity, that entity appoints its own official CR manager 
and CR controller. If specific obstacles to implementation become 
apparent – due to local legal requirements, for example – we work 
with the relevant individuals at the units affected who are respon-
sible for making decisions and who are involved in the process to 
develop a solution that satisfies the strategic key statements of 
the Policy. We agree a timeframe for implementation with them. If 
a solution is not implemented within the agreed timeframe, dialog 
is sought with the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom as 
the final escalation and decision-making level at which the func-
tions concerned can set out their arguments and the state of 
affairs accordingly.

United states segment: responsible business 
T-Mobile’s network technology positively impacts the way society 
lives, works, learns, and engages with the world. That’s why, when 
it comes to corporate responsibility, the segment’s environmental, 
social, and governance (ESG) approach is guided by the aspiration 
to create a connected world where everyone can thrive.
The ongoing commitment of T-Mobile US is fundamental to 
responsible business practices that promote integrity, responsibil-
ity, and transparency – while never losing sight of the opportunity 
to leverage its technology, scale and resources to be a force for 
good.
Continuously investing in responsible business practices under-
pins our ESG approach at T-Mobile US. That means being uncom-
promising in its ethical code and upholding strong corporate gov-
ernance policies and practices that help everyone at T-Mobile US 
build and retain the trust of customers, employees, and the com-
munities served. The segment’s Code of Business Conduct pro-
vides clear expectations on workplace conduct standards and 
legal guidelines. Training is carried out throughout the year and all 
employees and officers must participate. This annual training 
includes topics, such as Data Security and Privacy, Anti-Corrup-
tion, Harassment and Discrimination, and Non-Retaliation, among 
others.

Europe segment: resource efficiency for mobile and fixed-
network devices
We are aiming to ensure that, by 2024, 
none of the electronic waste produced 
and no used devices that are collected in 
the Europe operating segment, such as 
smartphones, routers or laptops, end up 
in landfills without undergoing recycling 
processes, but will be disposed of properly 
or recycled, as is already the case in 
Germany.
We achieved this goal by the end of 2022 and are 
planning to roll out implementation to T‑Mobile US and 
T‑Systems in future.
Waste avoidance, recycling and resource conservation
By 2030, we intend to ensure that almost 
all of the products we bring into circulation 
can be returned to the circular ecosystem.

Values and Guiding Principles
Corporate responsibility (CR) is based on shared values. Our fun-
damental values are set out in binding Guiding Principles. We have 
made these Principles part of the everyday work of our employees 
through a variety of measures, such as reviews, updates, and our 
annual “Living Culture Day.” And the measures have been success-
ful. According to our pulse survey to determine employee satisfac-
tion in November 2023, 80 percent of our employees agree that 
the Guiding Principles are actually being applied to our everyday 
work (prior year: 80 percent). The corresponding agreement figure 
among our executive staff was even higher, at 85 percent.
We want to ensure that everyone in our Group and with our part-
ner companies knows how to act responsibly and respect human 
rights. Our Code of Conduct, our Code of Human Rights, and our 
Supplier Code of Conduct all serve this purpose. The Codes also 
serve as the basis for our compliance management system, which 
guarantees that our business activities are in compliance with laws 
and regulations.

Certified health, safety, and environmental management: 
almost all workstations covered
Our integrated management system for Health, Safety, and Envi-
ronment (HSE) contributes at Group level to making sustainability 
a component of all our business processes and of our employees’ 
everyday lives.
It helps us to systematically plan, implement, and improve our HSE 
processes. This promotes the health of our employees and also has 
a positive effect on their performance. It also helps us to bid on 
new projects in which potential commercial customers require 
their suppliers to provide HSE certificates.
Our Group-level HSE management system is covered by an 
umbrella certificate based on the international standards ISO 
45001 (formerly OHSAS 18001) for occupational health and 
safety and ISO 14001 for environmental management. For some 
units, it also covers international standard ISO 9001 for quality 
management.
Some of the national companies are not covered by an umbrella 
certificate because they have their own certifications, some of 
which are even more comprehensive. This is the case in Greece, for 
example, where the OTE Group has its own integrated manage-
ment system. In addition to the standards named above, it also 
covers the international standards ISO 50001 for energy manage-
ment and ISO 27001 for data security.
All of our employees in Germany have ISO 14001- and ISO 
45001-certified workstations. Certificate coverage remains at the 
same level as in the previous year, however, with international cov-
erage of 98 percent of employees.
Certifications at the following national and international compa-
nies were added in 2023:
	
T-Systems Road User Services GmbH in Munich and Bonn (cer-
tified to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001)

Risk and opportunity management
For us, comprehensive risk and opportunity management also 
means considering the opportunities and risks arising from eco-
logical or social aspects, or from the management of our company 
(environment, social and governance – ESG). We actively and sys-
tematically involve relevant stakeholders in order to identify which 
current and potential ESG risks and opportunities are important for 
Deutsche Telekom. We also participate in a number of working 
groups and committees. We continuously track ESG issues and 
systematically ascertain our stakeholders’ positions on these mat-
ters.
Important tools we use for this purpose are:
	
Our risk management system, which systematically identifies, 
evaluates, and adresses relevant risks
	
Our (annual) evaluation of emerging risks, which provides an 
overview of new and long-term trends in external risks
	
Our extensive analysis of physical and transitory risks (risks 
resulting from sudden adjustments to economic sectors due to 
climate change), which we align with the recommendations of 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
	
Our involvement in working groups and committees, numerous 
national and international business associations, and social 
organizations (GeSI, Federation of German Industries, Bitkom, 
econsense, and the German National Association of Senior Citi-
zen's Organizations, for example)
	
Stakeholder dialog formats organized by us
	
Our various publications, such as the media review and news-
letters
	
Our internal compliance evaluation, which also examines the 
most important sustainability risks
	
Our materiality process, which we are continually developing. 
In 2023, key factors influencing further development were 
recent revision the German Corporate Governance Code 
(GCGC) and preparations for the requirements from the CSRD.
In our annual report, we also provide information about the follow-
ing issues, which we have identified as key aspects of our risk-and-
opportunity management process:
	
Climate protection
	
Due diligence obligations in the Group (German Act on Corpo-
rate Due Diligence in Supply Chains [Lieferkettensorgfaltspfli-
chtgesetz – LkSG])

Emerging risks
Emerging risks are difficult to predict, because their future devel-
opment is extremely uncertain. They involve events that are 
beyond our influence and control, such as geopolitical tension, 
new technologies, or macroeconomic factors. These risks are 
either new or become significantly more significant for our com-
pany over time. Even if they already impact our business today, 
their impact can grow in the long term (three to five years) and 
potentially impede most of our activities to a much greater extent 
in the future.
We need to act early and effectively to identify and assess risks 
like this and protect our company and our customers from them. 
This could even require adjustment of our strategy and/or our 
business models to mitigate their impact. To enable us to respond 
to such risks comprehensively, our risk management system must 
systematically identify and assess these emerging risks, to derive 
mitigating measures.
We describe the emerging risks that are becoming increasingly 
important to us here.

Emerging risks with relevance for Deutsche Telekom
Technological risk: cyber attacks
Cyber attacks are increasing rapidly. The speed of digital transfor-
mation, machine learning, and computing capacity is growing 
exponentially. At the same time, the attacks are becoming increas-
ingly specific and efficient. They are overtaking security fixes, with 
the result that the number of vulnerabilities that could be exploited 
by this kind of attack at our company is increasing.
The potential impacts of this risk include:
	
Failure to protect our infrastructure and our customer data 
against cyberattacks
	
A lack of knowledge among employees or excessively complex 
infrastructure can make it more difficult to prevent cyberat-
tacks, such as those triggered by artificial intelligence
	
Compliance with increasingly strict legal requirements for data 
retention and data protection could affect our strategy or our 
business models
	
Financial losses can arise from the new extortion techniques 
that are increasingly being used in attacks and demanding 
payments in cryptocurrencies, for example
	
Loss of reputation, because customers could lose trust in the 
quality of our communications services
Our corrective measures include:
	
Switching to more robust IT control environments
	
Improving protection against widespread types of attacks
	
Deploying machine learning technology (artificial intelligence) 
to identify attacks
	
Improving reactivity when defending against identified attacks
	
Raising awareness of cyberattacks among our customers
	
Better recognition of malware and improvement of user 
authentication techniques
We explain further measures in the “Data protection & data secu-
rity” chapter.
Environmental risk: weather extremes
Advancing climate change will increase the intensity and fre-
quency of extreme weather events. The related physical effects 
include warming oceans, higher heat and humidity, increased 
average temperatures, heavy storms (wind, lightning, hail, torna-
does, and hurricanes), and heat waves – which in turn can result in 
natural disasters like flooding and drought.
The potential impacts of this risk include:
	
Flooding of river basins and coastal areas due to heavy rainfall, 
which can destroy or seriously damage our base stations, net-
work nodes, and other infrastructure
	
Tornadoes and hurricanes that can cause significant damage to 
data centers, cell towers, office buildings, and our retail outlets
	
Heavy storms can also damage or destroy cell towers, particu-
larly at higher-elevation sites
	
Forest fires and heat waves can damage or destroy nearby cell 
towers or our equipment sites
	
Infrastructure that is not robust enough to withstand these 
tougher conditions in the long term
	
Reduction in the stability of our power supply
These impacts could result in longer and more frequent network 
outages, which in turn have the potential to lower our revenue, 
increase our churn rate, and damage our reputation. In addition, 
additional investments will be necessary to adapt our processes 
and make our infrastructure more robust. The costs of insurance 
cover for such events will likely increase steadily over time.
Our risk mitigation measures include:
	
Better methods for predicting when and where potential disas-
ters might occur in future
	
Identifying weak points in our cell towers and other infrastruc-
ture
	
Eliminating identified weak points in our infrastructure to with-
stand higher wind speeds and temperatures; designing more 
robust network infrastructure in areas that are particularly sus-
ceptible to such disasters
	
Installing emergency power supplies for all critical network ele-
ments, to avoid network outages and reduce downtimes
	
Improving our plans for maintaining operations and for disaster 
recovery for scenarios in which such outages might occur
Business risk: infectious diseases/pandemics
Outbreaks of disease and pandemics cannot be predicted. None-
theless, historical data shows that regional and global pandemics 
have become increasingly frequent over the past decades. A new 
sickness or virus can spread quickly, become a pandemic, and 
drastically impede global economic growth. This can affect multi-
ple industry sectors and supply chains and have significant 
impacts on the way we live and work.

Strategy
Risks & Opportunities

21
The potential impacts of this risk include:
	
Increasingly delayed deliveries and payments, as well as pay-
ment defaults among business customers and consumers 
could increase our bad debts
	
Restrictions in the public sphere could force our stores to close 
and affect sales and services for our customers
	
Travel restrictions could affect our roaming traffic volumes and 
our revenue
	
Customer growth could be curbed, because it is difficult to 
acquire new customers
	
Companies may need to reduce their orders of IT services and 
devices
	
Restrictions to social contacts (distance learning and working 
from home) could overload our networks and reduce their effi-
ciency
	
In the case of a severe pandemic, coupled with restrictions, our 
workforce could be reduced temporarily or permanently
Our corrective measures include:
	
Monitoring of relevant developments by our Group Situation 
Center
	
Organization of crisis management and task forces
	
Issuance of pandemic guidelines
	
Provision of suitable hygienic and personal protective equip-
ment for sales outlets, offices, and network infrastructure sites
	
Ramping up and hardening our networks to handle additional 
peak loads in voice and data traffic
	
Protecting our customers and employees through mobile 
working, online sales, and online customer service
Geopolitical risk: geopolitical instability
Geopolitical tensions endanger stability with respect to the global 
economy and the financial markets. Economic, political, and/or 
technological rivalries between geopolitical powers could lead to 
further trading barriers and thus drive deglobalization even further.
The main potential impacts of this risk include:
	
Sanctions could lead to significant restrictions within our sup-
ply chain, potentially resulting in disruptions to business
	
Increased regulatory uncertainty could result in the alteration 
or removal of network infrastructure
	
Rising prices for the purchase of raw materials and supplies or 
even a scarcity of resources
	
Increased volatility on the financial markets could have a nega-
tive impact on the development of interest rates, exchange 
rates, and even our share price
Our risk mitigation measures include:
	
Diversification of our supply chain to cover numerous countries 
and various suppliers to reduce our dependence on individual 
countries
	
Increasing our supplies of critical components
Creating transparency regarding service relationships that could 
be critical across the entire value chain
	
Monitoring political developments to be able to take suitable 
action right away
Social risk: availability of talented job candidates
Our long-term success depends on our ability to acquire top tal-
ents, to hold on to them, and to develop them further. The world-
wide skills shortage could get worse since young people are join-
ing the workforce later on, older staff are leaving earlier, and there 
is a general increase in the need for experts in digitalization across 
all industries.
The main potential impacts of this risk include:
	
Reduced productivity could impact our innovativeness and 
threaten our competitive advantage
	
Trying to reach our most important business and financial tar-
gets with unfilled positions could lead to project delays and 
impact our efficiency
	
Increased pressure for existing staff could in turn lead to higher 
stress levels or greater dissatisfaction among employees and 
have a negative impact on our corporate culture
	
The loss of experienced employees could lead to knowledge 
gaps in key areas
Our risk mitigation measures include:
	
Succession planning, in which top talents are identified and 
developed to take on leadership positions

Our process for identifying material CR topics
For some two decades now, we have used a materiality-assess-
ment process to identify the topics that are relevant for our sus-
tainability strategy and for our reporting. Our materiality-assess-
ment process takes account of provisions of the German Commer-
cial Code (HGB) and of the 2021 Global Reporting Initiative. We 
are continuously refining our materiality analysis. In 2023, the key 
factors influencing refinement of this process included the provi-
sions of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD), which will be relevant for our reporting as of the 2024 
reporting year. However, since the CSRD will have the effect of 
changing the materiality criteria, we have selected the topics for 
the present non-financial statement (NFS) on the basis of our 
2022 materiality analysis, which we reviewed in the reporting year 
to ensure it was fully up to date.
In connection with a document analysis covering the value chain, 
we explored existing and forthcoming legislation, various competi-
tors, and the expectations of our stakeholders, e.g., the capital 
markets. An underlying process dating from 2022, considering the 
entire value chain, had identified the negative and positive impacts 
of our business activities on the environment, society, and human 
rights, along with pertinent financial sustainability opportunities 
and risks. We then assessed the positive and negative impacts 
based on the probability of their occurrence and the scope of their 
impacts on the environment, society, and human rights. In the pro-
cess, we examined the following value creation stages: extraction 
of resources, production by our suppliers, Deutsche Telekom’s 
business operations – divided into “administrative processes” and 
“network build-out and data centers,” usage of our products and 
services by our customers, and disposal and recycling. In the year 
under review, we also considered the results of existing materiality 
analyses from four national companies (T-Mobile US, T-Mobile Pol-
ska, Hrvatski Telekom, and OTE Group), in order to incorporate a 
geographically and socially broad-based international perspective.
In addition, to determine financial materiality, the identified sus-
tainability opportunities and risks were assessed, in internal inter-
views, with regard to the probability of their occurrence and their 
potential financial impact on our business. The results of the 
updated materiality analysis were then validated in an internal 
workshop with participants from various functional units. As a 
result of their own activities, the participants were familiar with the 
concerns of a range of external stakeholders, and they highlighted 
these concerns in the process.
This review process identified energy consumption in the supply 
chain, and in transportation, as an additional key issue for the non-
financial statement. Last year’s CR report covered the same issue 
in connection with the topic “Greenhouse-gas emissions – Scope 
1, 2, 3.” All in all, the analysis results and related internal discus-
sions have identified issues relating to climate action, circular 
economies, and health and safety as being of particular impor-
tance for Deutsche Telekom.

As part of the materiality analysis, we analyzed potential scenarios 
for financial materiality. Sustainable products can help mitigate 
existing social, economic, or ecological problems, for example. 
On the other hand, adverse environmental impacts, such as larger 
quantities of produced waste, can increase costs (in this case, 
costs for waste management). The results show that currently, cli-
mate-related topics, data protection, access to the information 
society, and individual aspects in the supply chain pose a financial 
risk to society, the environment, and human rights, as well as to us 
as a company. Harmful substances along the supply chain can 
impair human health, for example, and increasing legal require-
ments that we have to meet can increase costs. On the other hand, 
our products and services can help solve ecological and social 
challenges. For example, we offer solutions that help reduce 
energy consumption. Such challenges, therefore, pose opportuni-
ties for sustainable development, as well as market opportunities 
for us. For years now, these issues have been taken into account in 
Deutsche Telekom’s overarching risk-and-opportunity manage-
ment process, and they are described in detail each year in our 
annual report.
To determine the key topics, we defined “materiality thresholds” 
for each of the impacts (financial as well as impacts on the envi-
ronment, society, and human rights). A topic is considered material 
as soon as one of these thresholds is exceeded.

Materiality as a basis for evaluation of ESG risks and 
opportunities
In the year under review, we once again used our materiality analy-
sis as a starting point for identifying and evaluating financial risks 
and opportunities that arise in connection with our sustainability 
issues. In the Group, risks and opportunities are generally assessed 
using a standardized risk process. As a result, many topics are cov-
ered that are also highly relevant from a sustainability perspective. 
The complementary consideration of financial impacts in the 
framework of the materiality analysis also helps us take impacts on 
the environment, society, and human rights into account. If new 
findings arise in this process, they are incorporated within the 
standardized risk process.

Impact measurement and management
What impacts do our business operations have on society, the 
economy and the environment? To what extent are we contribut-
ing, with our products, solutions and measures, to the achieve-
ment of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? These 
questions guide us in our impact measurement.
We know that to achieve our overarching aim – to constantly 
increase our business operations’ positive impacts and minimize 
their negative impacts – we must precisely measure the impacts 
of our activities.
With the support of experts from within and outside of the com-
pany, we have developed a multi-stage impact measurement 
approach. It enables us to identify the impacts of projects, prod-
ucts, and measures in key ecological and social areas, and to iden-
tify their contributions to the SDGs. This process was validated by 
an examination performed by TÜV Rheinland in the year under 
review.
We use the results of impact measurement to continually improve 
our sustainability performance. In addition, they give us valuable 
information that helps us in transparently communicating the sus-
tainability benefits of our products to consumers and business 
customers, investors, and other stakeholders.
At the beginning of the process, the responsible experts explain 
the sustainability aspects of the products and measures con-
cerned. If significant ecological or social/societal impacts are iden-
tifiable, we determine how to proceed:

For products and projects relating to the environment, we 
define the target situation we want to achieve – i.e., the prod-
uct to be assessed – and the initial situation – i.e., a product 
being used for comparison. We also define the relevant chal-
lenges to be solved. The initial situation and the target situation 
are analyzed, throughout the entire applicable life cycle, in 
terms of their environmental impacts. The resources used in 
each of the two situations (initial and target) are compared. 
The results of the comparison are then used as a basis for cal-
culating the pertinent CO₂ savings and any other environmen-
tal impacts and benefits, such as reduced water consumption.

To identify the positive impacts of our products and projects of 
social and/or societal relevance, we identify relevant current 
and future societal challenges, and show how our products or 
services could help tackle them. In the process, we certify 
measures that make positive contributions to social and soci-
etal challenges in the digital world, such as measures that 
improve digital participation, improve working conditions or 
help reduce online hate speech and risks.
To obtain transparent and comparable results, we describe the 
various impact contributions using established metrics for use of 
resources, and with the help of external frameworks, such as the 
SDGs. That allows us to also evaluate our contributions to sustain-
able development from a global perspective. In doing so, we 
always ensure that our methods are based on robust data and 
assumptions, and are effective for several years. We also describe 
the relevant starting point, or baseline, as accurately as possible so 
that we can reliably evaluate and account for the concrete external 
impact.
Each completed impact assessment adds to our understanding of 
the interactions involved – and does so also with respect to all 
subsequent analyses. We are continually refining our impact 
measurement process, which has been in place since 2020. In 
doing so, we take account of both internal requirements and exter-
nal requirements, such as those arising from regulatory provisions 
and market developments. At the same time, we are working to 
bring about commonly accepted standards for measurement of 
the societal impacts of our products and services – for example, in 
the framework of the European Green Digital Coalition (EGDC).
In the year under review, we determined the impacts of a total of 
13 projects, products, and measures. Overall, 50 of our products 
and solutions have earned one of the two labels #GreenMagenta 
or #GoodMagenta described. We have included descriptions of 
concrete, selected examples applying to the Germany and System 
Solutions segments and to all segments. Our Europe segment and 
DTSE also offer labeled products. A current overview of all labeled 
products is available on our website.

Impact assessment for the Germany segment
Since 2020, various products of the Germany segment have 
undergone our impact measurement process. As part of such 
assessment, the products were reviewed for any contributions to 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The analyzed prod-
ucts – digital solutions – help companies reduce their emissions, 
save energy and create circular economies.
The Deutsche Telekom Sustainability Manager
The Deutsche Telekom Sustainability Manager (Telekom Nach-
haltigkeitsmanager) is a central platform for successful manage-
ment of Environment/Social/Governance (ESG) aspects and 
issues. New provisions such as the Act on Corporate Due Diligence 
in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG) 
and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) now 
require companies to achieve greater transparency in their sustain-
ability activities. Via the Deutsche Telekom Sustainability Manager 
platform, we provide digital tools that support companies in com-
plying with legal requirements in the area of ESG and in achieving 
their ESG goals.
For example, the tools support CSRD-compliant preparation of 
ESG reports and precise calculation of carbon footprints, and they 
help enhance transparency in supply chains.
The Deutsche Telekom Sustainability Manager also helps compa-
nies structure their reporting process, by facilitating targeted entry 
of performance indicators and precise allocation of responsibili-
ties. Each performance indicator can be linked to specific tasks, 
measures and goals. Online guides facilitate data entry. By sup-
porting companies in measuring their impacts, the Manager helps 
companies reach their goals. In addition, it streamlines and accel-
erates the entire reporting process. Also, it supports user-friendly 
online publishing of downloadable sustainability reports – which 
has the added benefit of saving paper.
By helping companies record and manage their sustainability indi-
cators, the Deutsche Telekom Sustainability Manager contributes 
to SDG 13 (Climate Action).
This solution has been awarded the #GreenMagenta label.
One device for all network functions: Deutsche Telekom’s uCPE 
device
As the market for electronic devices keeps growing, so do its nega-
tive environmental impacts, such as unsustainable resources con-
sumption in production, and continual accumulation of electronic 
waste. With a view to reducing the numbers of devices our cus-
tomers require, the Germany segment is now offering devices that 
combine a range of different features that used to call for separate 
devices. The devices, known as “universal Customer Premise 
Equipment (uCPE)” devices, have been available from the Ger-
many segment since 2023, for companies in Germany that have 
international locations. The devices bring together and virtualize a 
full complement of network services, including services that used 
to necessitate separate devices, such as SD-WAN, firewall and 
route-optimization services. Use of uCPE devices in connection 
with other services is planned for a later date.
Often, customers use different devices to manage different net-
work and security functions. But each device comes with its own 
space, power and cooling requirements. Because it combines a 
range of different network functions in one unit, therefore, the Ger-
many segment’s new uCPE device is helping the segment’s busi-
ness customers reach their sustainability goals. As a single unit 
that replaces multiple devices, the new device enables customer 
locations to significantly reduce their power consumption. In addi-
tion, it reduces transport costs, thereby helping to streamline 
logistics processes. Furthermore, the new uCPE device comes 
with “extra CPU” chips that customers can activate as necessary, 
as their requirements grow, without having to order larger devices. 
This also helps keep the new product’s carbon footprint small.
In the framework of a 24-month contract period, replacement of 
three separate devices with a single uCPE device can save about 
1 900 kg of CO₂e emissions.
This solution contributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): By requiring 
fewer devices in all, systems with uCPE devices improve logis-
tics processes.
	
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): The pack-
aging for uCPE devices is made of recycled materials and is 
fully recyclable. Also, the soy-based ink used in printing on the 
packaging outperforms conventional ink in terms of sustaina-
bility.
The uCPE device has been awarded the #GreenMagenta label.
More-sustainable management of companies’ devices
Smartphones and tablets play an indispensable role in our every-
day working lives. At the same time, companies are finding that the 
task of managing all of their employees' company-owned devices 
is becoming more and more complex. In many cases, when 
devices reach the end of their useful lives within the company, 
they are simply put away and are no longer used. In addition, in 
many cases devices are replaced before they have reached the 
end of their useful lives, and then are neither used nor properly 
recycled.
In cooperation with the “everphone” mobile device service, the 
Germany segment offers its business customers “Device as a Ser-
vice” plans. Under such plans, the Germany segment manages 
devices for its customers. This responsibility includes active col-
lection of devices from employees, exchange and expert repair of 
defective devices, and certified disposal and recycling of devices 
taken out of service. This increases the service lives of devices 
within companies.
Our impact measurement in 2021 found that Device as a Service 
can reduce emissions by about 50 kilograms of CO₂ equivalents 
per company smartphone and tablet. The refurbishment rate 
increases to over 97 percent. Also, employees become more aware 
of the need to use devices sustainably, throughout the entire value 
chain. In addition, the high refurbishment rates and longer usage

lifetimes associated with the service ease pressures on production, 
logistics, and disposal processes (SDG 12).
The service also contributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure): Systematic 
management of company smartphones and tablets enables 
more-efficient, more-sustainable use of valuable resources.
	
SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): Deutsche Telekom and 
everphone plan to work together to roll out Device as a Service 
in additional countries, and they are seeking to share their 
knowledge in this context.
We have awarded this service our #GreenMagenta sustainability 
label.
Our sustainability platform promotes awareness of mobility-
related emissions
Direct and indirect CO₂ emissions from companies' own or pur-
chased resources (Scope 1 and 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) 
can be reduced relatively easily with targeted measures. It is 
important to note, however, that indirect emissions occurring 
throughout the value chain (Scope 3) will increasingly be the real 
key to reducing company-wide emissions. Such emissions include 
CO₂ emissions generated through employees' business travel and 
commuting.
Telekom MMS, which is part of the Germany segment, is now 
offering business customers the “EcoShift” sustainability platform. 
Via EcoShift, in combination with a special CO₂ app, companies 
can keep records of their employees’ mobility habits. On the basis 
of such records, the application shows companies the resulting 
carbon footprints and, on the platform, links the data with specific 
recommendations. In addition, a system dashboard enables com-
panies to monitor and analyze their CO₂ emissions from business 
travel and commuting – and derive measures for reducing them.
After operating this sustainability platform with nearly 2 000 app 
users, our impact measurement has shown that it has reduced CO₂ 
emissions by about 12 metric tons annually per 100 employees. 
The platform's transparent presentation of emissions data helps 
make employees more aware of their travel-related emissions, and 
it can inspire them to begin cycling to work or to use public trans-
portation for their commutes. The platform was developed, and is 
now being operated, with electricity from renewable energies 
(SDG 13).
The service also contributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and 11 (Sustainable Cit-
ies and Communities): It helps reduce traffic emissions and air 
pollution in cities. It also contributes to employees' health and 
well-being.
	
SDGs 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 12 
(Responsible Consumption and Production): The platform pro-
vides a clear overview of company-wide mobility-related emis-
sions, and it supports derivation of specific measures to reduce 
them. In addition, it features interfaces that cut the time 
required to determine carbon footprints and provide pertinent 
real-time data for company reports.
We have awarded this service our #GreenMagenta sustainability 
label.
Impact measurement for the Systems Solutions segment
Since 2020, various products of our systems business segment 
have undergone our impact measurement process. In addition, the 
products have been reviewed for any contributions to the Sustain-
able Development Goals (SDGs). With them, T-Systems is seeking 
to enable customers to operate more sustainably.
Supply Chain Transparency Suite
Today’s complex global supply chains, unfortunately enough, often 
entail human rights abuses, such as child labor, as well as height-
ened risks for workers’ health, such as risks from accidents and 
toxic chemicals. Now the Systems Solutions segment has devel-
oped the Transparency Suite, a software-based solution for protec-
tion of human rights. As an added benefit, the Suite supports com-
pliance with the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply 
Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG), including its 
socially and ecologically oriented provisions.
The Transparency Suite comprises a risk management system that 
is automatically updated on a daily basis. Depending on the pack-
age selected, the Suite combines internal and external data in 
ways that support ongoing assessment of supply chains and the 
suppliers directly or indirectly involved in them. Using the requisite 
data it continually collects, the Suite divides supply chains into risk 
clusters, identifies human-rights violations and highlights available 
corrective measures. In the process, the Suite also makes use of 
external resilience data, augmented reality and artificial intelli-
gence (AI), which will make further automation increases possible 
in the future. Also, the Transparency Suite can be used to compile 
data for reports to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and 
Export Control (BAFA).
The strategic approach applied by our Transparency Suite provides 
the basis for comprehensive CSR reporting. As a result, it contrib-
utes to the following SDGs:
	
SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): The German Act on Cor-
porate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltsp-
flichtengesetz – LkSG) requires companies to review their pro-
duction processes for any use of hazardous substances that 
can contaminate groundwater.
	
SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Monitoring and 
analysis of human rights risks provide ways to mitigate such 
risks.

SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): SDG 12 
applies especially to handling of chemicals and waste through-

Diligence in Supply Chains – compliance with which is 
reviewed in this context – promotes compliance with the 
Stockholm Convention and the Basel Convention, both of 
which are relevant to the issues detailed above.
This solution has been awarded the #GoodMagenta label.
Smart Groundwater Monitoring
Climate change is bringing increasingly frequent and severe 
droughts, and the water shortages they cause highlight the need 
to conserve and protect groundwater resources. In the medium 
and long terms, changes in annual rainfall distribution will affect 
groundwater formation and lead to local drops in groundwater 
tables. Pumping of groundwater can exacerbate this problem. 
Consequently, the agriculture sector, which uses water especially 
intensively, needs to find ways to reduce its water consumption.
Now, the Systems Solutions segment’s “Smart Groundwater Moni-
toring,” an IoT solution, is facilitating sustainable water manage-
ment strategies. It includes a digital water meter that collects and 
analyzes groundwater-use data. Precise water-flow monitoring can 
help make water use in field irrigation more sustainable. The sys-
tem’s detailed-analysis capabilities support more-efficient, varia-
ble distribution of water rights, and they facilitate faster detection 
– and elimination – of weaknesses in water-management strate-
gies. The system also provides hourly notification of pumped 
water quantities, and this simplifies compliance with obligations 
for notification of competent authorities. Our impact measure-
ment, taking account of 600 pumping sites over a 10-hour period, 
found that fine-tuning of irrigation in keeping with weather condi-
tions can save up to 30 percent of the groundwater (540 000 m³) 
that would normally be used. Throughout the course of a year with 
five months of irrigation, the system can reduce CO₂e emissions by 
more than 130 000 kg, by enabling farmers to monitor groundwa-
ter use remotely.
The digital water-meter system contributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDG 2 (Zero Hunger): Optimization of agricultural irrigation 
helps prevent crop failures – and thereby helps prevent food 
shortages and meet basic food needs.
	
SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): Monitoring and regulation 
of groundwater use can help improve water availability.
	
SDG 15 (Life on Land): Careful, conservation-oriented water 
use helps protect freshwater ecosystems, aquifer fauna and 
overall biodiversity.
This solution has been awarded the #GoodMagenta label.
Digital bill of lading helps conserve resources and make 
processes more efficient
A digital bill of lading developed in close cooperation with various 
commerce/industry partners is now providing a modern alterna-
tive to conventional paper documents in supply chains. Doing 
away with printed documents saves valuable resources: Every mil-
lion sheets of paper saved represents savings of 7.7 metric tons of 
CO₂ equivalents and nearly 6 000 cubic meters of water.
Also, the system helps optimize processes – and thereby reduce 
resources consumption – by using real-time communication and 
reducing document losses.
The digital bill of lading is an innovative, sustainable way to make 
business workflows more efficient. This solution, therefore, con-
tributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation): By saving paper, the pro-
duction of which is water-intensive, use of the digital bill of lad-
ing saves water.
	
SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure): The digitaliza-
tion the system brings helps make industrial processes more 
efficient.
	
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): Elimina-
tion of unnecessary paper consumption is a sustainable-con-
sumption solution.
The digital bill of lading has been awarded the #GoodMagenta 
label.

Sensor-equipped containers for used textiles, for optimized 
recycling processes
Demand for clothing and textiles keeps growing – along with 
incineration-based disposal of textiles that reach the end of their 
life cycles, which has negative climate impacts and wastes 
resources. Current practices for managing discarded used clothing 
and textiles are using growing quantities of new raw materials. To 
promote circular economies, and thereby help conserve resources, 
we collect discarded textile items for upcycling, using collection 
containers connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). The contain-
ers have integrated fill-level sensors that help to analyze and opti-
mize the collection process, and make it as efficient as possible.
The system makes it possible to optimize personnel assignments 
and pick-up routes, because the sensors automatically monitor the 
containers’ fill levels and send out just-in-time notification, via the 
IoT cloud, whenever a container fills up. Collected textile items are 
made available for reuse, wherever possible, or are properly recy-
cled by our partners. The optimized container emptying that the 
automatic fill-level monitoring and notification makes possible has 
reduced the average annual pick-up route distances by 30 per-
cent, or by about 9 400 km. That corresponds to CO₂e savings of 
about 23 metric tons of CO₂e per year, for ten containers for col-
lecting discarded textiles. Also, Deutsche Telekom has collected

about 21 metric tons of textiles for reuse. That corresponds to a 
CO₂-emissions reduction of 315 metric tons (cumulative) and 
138 million liters of water saved (also cumulative).
This solution also contributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities): By helping to 
cut CO₂e emissions and save time, the connected waste-textile 
containers help cities and communities become more sustain-
able.
	
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): The solu-
tion’s improved recycling process supports sustainable con-
sumption and production. It helps save and conserve natural 
resources.
This Deutsche Telekom sustainability solution is strongly focused 
on promoting a sense of responsibility, and it has been awarded 
the #GreenMagenta label.
A new app provides an easy way to apply for maternity and 
parental leave
Applications for maternity and parental leave present challenges 
for both employees and our human-resources department, 
because they tend to involve a lot of red tape, including the obtain-
ing of all required documents. Now, a new parental leave app 
offers our employees an innovative way of managing all the paper-
work. And it supports expectant parents throughout their entire 
parental leave.
By providing a comprehensive, detailed overview of the applica-
tion process for parental leave, and monitoring the status of sub-
mitted applications, the app plays a useful role – for all involved 
persons – from the time an employee first notifies the company of 
a pregnancy until the time they are able to return to work. With just 
a few clicks, users can download needed forms – and, in most 
cases – complete them within the app, which offers the added 
benefit of saving paper.
With estimated savings of 340 kg paper and 880 kg CO₂e per year, 
the parental leave app is making a positive environmental contri-
bution.
In addition, the app provides access to the “Stay in ContacT” net-
work, via which employees on parental leave can stay in touch with 
employees in the workplace – and cultivate contacts that can 
facilitate their return to their regular jobs.
With the parental leave app, we are contributing to the following 
SDGs:
	
SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): By facilitating the 
tasks of applying for and organizing parental leave, the app 
reduces the relevant stress for expectant mothers and fathers.
	
SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities): The app is available for all 
expectant parents – regardless of gender.
	
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): The paper 
savings achieved by the app promote sustainable consump-
tion.
This solution has been awarded the #GoodMagenta label.
A fun and games way to learn about online security: “
AwareNessi – the fantastic security activity book“
Children today begin using the internet at very young ages. But 
not enough children are being taught, age-appropriately, about 
data and information security, however. Deutsche Telekom is now 
publishing “AwareNessi – The Fantastic Security Activity Book,” an 
internet-safety magazine for children between the ages of eight 
and twelve (and their parents). With its fun-and-games approach, 
“AwareNessi” warns children about internet risks without making 
them afraid.
“AwareNessi” supports parents in talking with their children about 
internet safety, and in teaching them to use the internet with care 
(SDG 4).
This service also contributes to the following SDGs:
	
SDGs 5 (Gender Equality) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities): 
“AwareNessi” is a gender-neutral avatar. The magazine uses 
gender-neutral language that is appropriate for children.
	
SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure): “AwareNessi” 
guides children and adults in using security tools in cyber-
space.
	
SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production): Issues of 
“AwareNessi” are available in digital form, for printout only as 
necessary. This helps reduce paper waste.
	
SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions): For each issue 
of “AwareNessi,” our employees volunteer 60 hours of their 
time (for development, design, and communication). In addi-
tion to helping make children aware about data and informa-
tion security, “AwareNessi” promotes respectful conduct and 
interaction online.
	
SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): The issues are available in 
16 different languages. Consequently, “AwareNessi” provides 
reliable information about the internet internationally.

We have awarded this solution our #GoodMagenta label.

Our Contribution tothe SustainableDevelopmentGoals
„As the leading European telco, we also want to be a leader 
when it comes to sustainability.” A comparison with the 17 
United Nations SDGs shows that many of our activities, services, 
and products are already helping to meet ecological and soci-
etal challenges today.“
We support the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 
United Nations (UN). Various studies have come to the conclusion 
that 103 (of a total of 169) subgoals associated with the SDGs can 
benefit from the use of ICT. Examples include the study entitled 
"ICT-centric economic growth, innovation, and job creation," pub-
lished in 2017 by the International Telecommunication Union, and 
the “SMARTer2030” study launched by the GeSI (Global e-Sustain-
ability Initiative) initiative in 2019.
Our network infrastructure forms the technological foundation; it 
enables solutions to social and ecological challenges, hence con-
tributing to achieving many SDGs. That is why we believe we can 
make the biggest impact on SDG 9: “Build resilient infrastructure, 
promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster 
innovation.”
The following overview details how we contribute to implementing 
the SDGs. It also shows how we measure our contribution, and 
refers to specific examples from the current CR report.

Our contributions to achieving the SDGs have also had a positive 
effect on our Company. In order to highlight these contributions, 
we have divided them into five areas: “Employees”, “Finance”, 
“Structure”, “Relationships” and “Environment”. Each area has been 
assigned its own symbol.
To clearly highlight the contribution our products, services, and 
activities make toward the individual sustainability development 
goals and our value chain, we have marked the relevant passages

our concerns. In addition, it provides input that helps us recognize 
key trends early on. Also, it facilitates our innovation processes. 
The “Design for All” sounding board is a current example of our 
efforts to actively include our stakeholders. The sounding board, 
staffed with external experts, advises us on ways of making our 
products and processes more accessible and easier to use.

Formats for stakeholder engagement
We encourage stakeholder engagement in our corporate activities. 
With this in mind, we developed an appropriate strategy in 2011. 
It is based on the three AA1000 principles developed by Account-
Ability, a non-governmental organization: materiality, inclusivity, 
and responsiveness. Our compliance with these principles was 
reviewed and confirmed by an auditing company in connection 
with the introduction of our 2013 Strategy. In the 2023 reporting 
year, we intensified our dialog with our employees – for example, 
via our Green Pioneers Day – with a view to making our internal 
processes even more sustainable.
We used a case-based relevance analysis to identify the type and 
intensity of our stakeholder engagement. The more relevant a 
stakeholder group is to the topic or project concerned, the more 
intensive the engagement of that stakeholder group can be. 
Depending on the intensity, we make a distinction between three 
types of engagement: participation, dialog, and information.
The feedback that we receive from our stakeholders is incorpo-
rated into our CR activities and also affects the CR program.

A compliance management system aligned with the 
company’s risk situation
Our compliance culture is a key component for corporate govern-
ance based on integrity and respect. We have expressed our 
Group-wide commitment to complying with ethical principles and 
both legal and statutory requirements. This commitment has been 
incorporated in our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct.
Integrity – which necessarily encompasses compliance – forms 
the basis of all our business decisions and activities. It defines the 
behavior of all our employees in dealings with customers, employ-
ees, investors, managers, and Deutsche Telekom’s overall sphere 
of operations.
We have implemented a compliance management system (CMS) 
with the objective of minimizing risks from systematic breaches of 
legal or ethical standards. In this approach, we address risks that 
could result in regulatory or criminal liability of the company, its 
executive bodies, or its employees – or in significant harm to the 
company’s reputation. The Board of Management considers its 
overall responsibility for compliance as a key leadership task. Our 
Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for the design and man-
agement of the CMS. Compliance officers implement the CMS and 
our compliance goals locally at the level of our operating seg-
ments and national companies.
Our compliance work pursues the following objectives 
in particular:
	
Fostering a compliance culture and ethical conduct
	
Identifying, analyzing, and assessing compliance risks at an 
early stage
	
Integrating preventive measures in business processes early 
and permanently, to prevent breaches of compliance
	
Responding consistently to any breaches of compliance
	
Minimizing liability risks for the company
	
Being viewed as a dependable partner by customers and  
business partners

Ongoing audit of compliance management continued
We have our compliance management system audited and certi-
fied regularly by independent auditors, with particular attention 
paid to anti-corruption measures. In the 2020 and 2021 financial 
years, 22 companies were audited  successfully: nine German 
companies in 2020 and 13 international companies in 2021. The 
audits  focused in particular on processes in the companies that 
are exposed to an increased risk of corruption in general, for exam-
ple, in procurement, sales, events, donations, sponsorships, merg-
ers and acquisitions, and human resources. The next audit  of 
selected Group companies for certification purposes (IDW PS 980 
audit  standard) is planned for the 2024 and 2025 financial years.
Further development of the compliance management system 
through regular risk assessment
Compliance risk assessments (CRAs) are a foundation of our com-
pliance management system. We use CRAs to identify and assess 
compliance risks and implement appropriate preventive measures 
based on their results. To this end, we have introduced a process to 
be carried out at regular intervals. The companies that are 
inspected through CRAs are selected according to risk, using a 
model based on the maturity of the companies in question.
The Board of Management and the Audit Committee of the Super-
visory Board of Deutsche Telekom  are notified of the results of a 
compliance risk assessment.
The CRA methodology was adjusted in the reporting year and a 
focus CRA carried out. The focus CRA is a further evolution of the 
existing CRA approach. Under the new approach, the goal is to 
assess the effectiveness of the control environment in selected 
compliance risk areas. We piloted this approach in 2023, with a 
primary focus on our procurement processes. Ten international 
companies (the Europe and Systems Solutions operating seg-
ments) and one national company (Germany operating segment) 
participated in this focus CRA pilot project. The companies were 
selected according to risk, with a focus on international companies 
with their own procurement organization. The respective Group 
companies are responsible for carrying out both the focus CRA 
and the standard CRA. The central compliance organization man-
ages the overall process, providing support and advice at all 
stages.

A clear reference framework: Deutsche Telekom’s compliance 
policies
Our compliance culture is a key component for corporate govern-
ance based on integrity and respect. We have expressed our 
Group-wide commitment to complying with ethical principles and 
both legal and statutory requirements. This commitment has been 
incorporated in our Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct.
The Code of Conduct is further detailed by additional internal poli-
cies aimed, for example, at preventing corruption and breaches of 
antitrust laws.
Our compliance policies include strict requirements for providing 
gratuities to public officials, including facilitation payments in par-
ticular.
The Group Policy on Avoiding Corruption and Other Conflicts of 
Interest includes a basic rule that requires all employees to keep 
their personal interests separate from those of the company. In 
individual cases where conflicts of interest are unavoidable, 
employees are required to disclose and document such conflicts.
With our digital ethics guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI), we 
are committed to ensuring that our AI-based products and ser-
vices are used responsibly, including future developments. AI must 
be designed to be human-centered, to protect the sovereignty, 
freedom from discrimination, and freedom of speech of the per-
sons involved.

website.

Raising awareness of compliance risks among staff
We support our employees Group-wide with a variety of measures 
to ensure that their everyday work remains ethical and legally 
compliant: This includes:
	
A policies database that helps staff find and implement appli-
cable regulations
	
Regular compliance and anti-corruption training, which is also 
part of our onboarding processes for new employees. In the 
year under review, we rolled out an e-learning module on the 
fundamentals of compliance to all domestic and international 
Group employees (not including TMUS) that addresses anti-
corruption and other topics. This module is available in 14 lan-
guages. It also contains an in-depth section on dealing with 
(potential) conflicts of interest (see GRI 205-2)
	
It features short, to-the-point videos on compliance topics of 
relevance to everyday work procedures. They are available to 
employees at all times, via the YAM UNITED intranet portal and 
LinkedIn

Systematic handling of breaches of compliance through the 
TellMe whistleblower portal
For Deutsche Telekom, compliance with valid laws, internal poli-
cies, and principles of conduct is essential, because we know that 
corporate success is built on a foundation of integrity, ethics, and 
personal responsibility. That’s why we want to avoid all risks that 
could question our integrity and harm others.
If we are to live up to this responsibility, it is important that we are 
made aware of any misconduct that could have an impact on com-
pliance.
Deutsche Telekom therefore provides all employees and external 
parties with a means of reporting violations of laws and internal 
regulations – even anonymously – through the TellMe whistle-
blower portal, which has been in place since 2006. This also 
includes tip-offs regarding human rights-related and environmen-
tal risks, as well as legal violations in our global supply chain. It can 
involve the actions of our employees in internal business units of 
Group companies, as well as those of our suppliers or business 
partners. We follow up on all tip-offs related to a violation of legal 
or internal regulations, provided the description of the facts is ade-
quate.

If requested, all information provided by whistleblowers will be 
treated in confidence to the extent permitted by law. Provided that 
whistleblowers have acted to the best of their knowledge and in 
good faith and have not broken any applicable law themselves, 
they will not suffer any disadvantage or harm as a result of raising 
their concern. Reprisals against whistleblowers are prohibited, 
including threats of and attempts at reprisals. Every report will be 
thoroughly examined, suspected cases will be investigated, and 
any breaches rigorously followed up. Any violations we uncover 
will be rigorously sanctioned, without exception, according to legal 
provisions, regardless of the rank and position of the persons 
involved. This also includes possible termination of the employ-
ment relationship and an assertion of claims for damages. Any 
weaknesses identified in the internal control system during the 
investigation are systematically analyzed and remedied.
We have introduced a Group-wide reporting process to control 
and monitor these activities.
	
Most of the tip-offs received in 2023 focused on “financial 
interests” (possible cases of fraud, embezzlement, manipula-
tion of targets, and unfair sales methods).
	
In confirmed cases, we impose systematic sanctions that are 
proportionate to the act and the guilt of the perpetrator and 
are in line with applicable legal provisions. We publish other 
details, such as information about implemented measures, on 
our website.

Measures to strengthen our corporate culture
Compliance and integrity are key components of our corporate 
culture.
The world is getting increasingly complex and we are confronted 
with new challenges and regulations every day. This makes it more 
important than ever to offer reliable guidance to all employees, to 
enable them to act confidently and ethically in different situations.
Our e-learning offerings for compliance have been established 
Group-wide, including those covering value-based, cultural, and 
integrity-related aspects. In 2023, we rolled out an e-learning 
module on the fundamentals of compliance to all domestic and 
international Group employees (not including T-Mobile US) that 
addresses anti-corruption and other topics. This module is availa-
ble in 14 languages. We also held in-person training with Board of 
Management members and top management in 2023, in which we 
processed and discussed proper conduct in typical compliance 
dilemmas based on practical examples.
Our ICARE check, a self-test with five simple questions, supports 
our employees in making the right, responsible decisions in diffi-
cult situations.
Crossing borders: Worldwide cooperation for compliance
Different framework conditions in the countries where Deutsche 
Telekom is active represent a significant compliance challenge for 
us. The increasingly dynamic development of global markets, new 
digital business models, and intensified international competition 
also influence our compliance strategy.
To meet the Group’s demands as an international corporation, we 
regularly discuss strategic compliance topics with compliance 
officers at our international Group companies. At our International 
Compliance Days in 2023, compliance officers and compliance 
managers from our international and local units met in person with 
experts from Group Compliance to discuss current topics. In addi-
tion, new compliance managers were invited to an onboarding 
session at Deutsche Telekom’s headquarters in the year under 
review. In addition to the opportunity to meet their colleagues on 
the central Compliance team in person, the employees also 
learned about compliance processes, topics, and culture, along 
with challenges in the Group. Two classroom courses were held for 
new compliance managers in the year under review, culminating in 
the designation “Certified Compliance Manager.”
Each local department has a key account manager from the Group 
Compliance team, who exchanges information with them on a reg-
ular basis. More international exchange takes place in regular, vir-
tual compliance community calls, where compliance managers 
from local units take part in activities such as presenting their 
departments and local challenges to the community. Other topics 
in the virtual meetings included the compliance strategy, results 
from the compliance risk assessment, the compliance e-learning, 
the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains 
(Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG), and generative AI.

We also discuss compliance issues with other companies and with 
expert groups. In addition, we regularly promote the further devel-
opment of compliance standards and management systems 
through specialist presentations, publications, and other contribu-
tions.
Commitment to anti-corruption initiatives
We participate regularly in the work of national and international 
organizations that focus primarily on compliance issues. As a 
member of associations and organizations such as the German 
Institute for Compliance (DICO e. V.), the Compliance & Integrity 
forum of ZfW (Center for Business Ethics) and Bitkom, Germany’s 
digital association, we make use of opportunities to exchange 
ideas and experiences related to compliance.
For years now we have been using the United Nations International 
Anti-Corruption Day on December 9 as an opportunity to raise 
awareness in the Group about the issue of bribery and corruption. 
For more details, see the “Raising awareness of compliance risks 
among staff” section.
Responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI)
Digital responsibility is a task for society as a whole. Deutsche 
Telekom develops artificial intelligence (AI) and uses it in a variety 
of products and services for our customers and for internal use. 
AI systems have long become an integral component of how we 
work. For example, they are used to answer customer inquiries in 
the best possible way.
Like our commitments to high service quality and digital sover-
eignty, we are committed to the ethical use of AI that focuses on 
people and their needs (human-centered AI).
We are taking the following measures to ensure that human-
centric AI is embedded at the company:
	
An interdisciplinary working group on digital ethics was formed 
with employees from Group Compliance, T-Labs, DT Service, 
Legal, Group Privacy, Group Public and Regulatory Affairs, Pat-
ent & Brand, T-Systems, and Deutsche Telekom Services 
Europe and organizationally incorporated into the Law and 
Integrity area of the Compliance department. It deals with the 
ongoing development, support, and implementation of digital 
ethics throughout the Deutsche Telekom Group. It focuses on 
the implementation of foreseeable requirements from future  
AI regulation by the European Union.
	
Our Board of Management members Claudia Nemat (Technol-
ogy and Innovation) and Birgit Bohle (HR and Legal Affairs, 
Labor Director) are actively involved in coordinating activities 
in this area. The interdisciplinary working group on digital eth-
ics, for example, was coordinated in a co-creation approach by 
the two Board of Management members, along with the Chief 
Compliance Officer and the Head of Group Public & Regulatory 
Affairs.
	
Deutsche Telekom is taking a pioneering role in the use of AI in 
IT systems related to employment. To this end, an “AI Mani-
festo” (only available in German) was developed together with 
employee representatives to acknowledge the specific chal-
lenges posed by AI and incorporate technical and regulatory 
developments in internal processes. A body of experts consist-
ing of representatives from both groups was formed to support 
further implementation.
	
A body of experts on ChatGPT was founded at the beginning of 
the year to address the challenges of generative AI and enable 
exchange on and assessment of these new technologies across 
the relevant corporate disciplines. In February 2023, the body 
developed an action framework called “ChatGPT,” aimed at 
promoting understanding of the risks and opportunities that 
large language models present to our employees and establish 
a culture of enablement. The “ChatGPT” action framework reg-
ulates voluntary use of the test version of ChatGPT offered by 
OpenAI, to ensure that our employees who use this technology 
do so effectively and with awareness of their responsibilities.
	
To further promote a culture of enablement, the first “Deutsche 
Telekom Generative AI Prompt-A-Thon” was organized in Sep-
tember, where participants were encouraged to develop 
prompts to solve a variety of tasks and explore potential future 
uses of generative AI.
	
In addition, communities focused on topics such as “Human-
centered Technology” and operational implementation efforts 
such as the AI Competence Center (AICC), the Telekom 
Deutschland Data Tribe, and the T-Systems AI Factory receive 
central support within this framework to synchronize efforts at 
the corporate level with existing processes focused on digital 
ethics.
Against backdrop of human-centered AI, in 2018 we were one of 
the first companies in the world to develop guidelines for the ethi-
cal use of our AI. These guidelines illustrate how we use AI respon-
sibly. Our AI guidelines outline an approach in which AI is devel-
oped with people and their needs in mind. They are oriented to the 
pertinent legal foundations – and to our Code of Human Rights, in 
which we commit ourselves to upholding and promoting human 
rights and taking responsibility.
To further detail our AI guidelines and put them into practice, we 
have initiated measures such as the following:
	
The “Professional ethics” guide was developed together with 
technology experts and project managers. The guide presents 
best practices, methods, and tips for applying the AI Guidelines 
to development processes. With this guide, we seek to ensure 
that all developers who work with AI conform to the AI guide-
lines and implement them in the systems and products they 
develop.
	
We use our “Digital Ethics Assessment” to ensure that our ethi-
cal AI requirements can still easily be followed and imple-
mented in our development processes, as part of our “ethics by 
design” approach.

43
	
In addition, we have added the AI Guidelines to the curricula for 
various training and development courses for our employees. 
For example, we developed advanced training courses for data 
scientists and for our “Re-Skilling Academy,” in which we offer a 
variety of attractive formats – such as virtual guided tours and 
online training – and provide support for learning journeys on 
AI with extensive coverage of digital ethics.
	
To ensure that our high ethical standards for AI development 
are also reflected in our supply chain, we supplemented our 
Supplier Code of Conduct in 2020 with content related to our 
AI guidelines and updated it in 2022 – making us a pioneer in 
this area as well.
	
As part of our work as a member of various bodies, we proac-
tively share our experiences and insights with other companies. 
This occurs, for example, in our work in the Federation of Ger-
man Industries (BDI); the German Association for Information 
Technology, Telecommunications and New Media (Bitkom); the 
German Association for the Digital Economy (BVDW); and the 
D21 digitalization initiative.
Further development of the Compliance organization
Dynamic challenges in our market environment, increasing regula-
tory requirements, and changes in the working world require 
continual adjustments to our compliance management system. 
We also keep our Compliance staff’s knowledge up to date with 
requirement-based, situation-related training courses and cross-
company interchange formats, among other measures. In addition 
to professional development, these courses cover topics such as 
agility, modern working, and tools and processes.
To adapt our Compliance organization to the increasing demands 
of our internal and external customers and to agile working meth-
ods, the Group Compliance organization has been structured 
according to an agile organizational model with a focus on cus-
tomer centricity, processes, and digitalization and has been work-
ing with agile methods since 2021.
This ongoing development of our Compliance organization is 
intended to contribute to our customer-centric, lawful, sustained 
success as a company. Our compliance strategy focuses on our 
target vision of a leading digital compliance management system 
(leading digital CMS).
We envision a compliance management system (CMS) that does 
the following:
	
Integrating compliance requirements in business processes as 
seamlessly as possible
	
Showing the Group-wide status of the CMS and existing com-
pliance risks at all times, transparently and up to date
	
Actively takes up and addresses new developments in the busi-
ness and regulatory domains and uses the insights gained for 
continuous improvement
The key components of leading digital CMS are culture, trust, and 
simplicity.
	
Culture is the foundation of how we work together. Compli-
ance cannot succeed without a good, open corporate culture 
in which every individual is willing to take responsibility, admit 
mistakes, and point out risks.
	
Trust goes in two directions: The Compliance function serves 
as a trusted advisor, which develops solutions for dealing with 
compliance risks together with the business units. Conversely, 
the Compliance unit also returns this trust by only defining 
binding guidelines, where deemed necessary under risk 
aspects.
	
Simplicity means that we want to make it as simple as possible 
for everyone at the company to follow the rules and implement 
compliance requirements. This means formulating the rules 
clearly and simply, for instance, and limiting them to what is 
essential.
To achieve the objective of having a leading digital CMS, we have 
defined specific measures that we are implementing step by step.
	
We created the Compliance Digital Transformation cluster to 
consolidate digitalization expertise and drive forward the on-
going development and digitalization of compliance processes. 
Our efforts in 2023 included the implementation of our new 
Compliance Reporting Tool (CRT).
	
To address the modules of trust, culture, and simplicity overall, 
we developed the ICARE check, a simple self-test with five 
questions for critical situations. The test is intended to help all 
employees master difficult situations and judge whether they 
should obtain advice before deciding on how to proceed fur-
ther.
	
We also supplemented our classroom training courses with 
dilemmas from everyday business. Joint, interactive discussion 
of situations from everyday business that often make it difficult 
to find the right answer has resulted in a trusting, open dialog 
in the training courses, contributing to both the “culture” and 
“trust” elements.
	
In 2023, we rolled out an e-learning module on the fundamen-
tals of compliance to all domestic and international Group 
employees (not including T-Mobile US) that addresses anti-
corruption and other topics. This module is available in 14 lan-
guages. Based on a new learning concept, it incorporates a 
“tone from the top” approach – compliance as practiced by 
Board of Management members – combined with many inter-
active elements. The aim is to teach employees about compli-
ance in a simple, playful manner.

In addition, adjustments to compliance risk assessments and

needed to implement the German Act on Corporate Due

– LkSG) took effect on January 1, 2023.
Our measures for the organization’s evolution with regard to 
artificial intelligence (AI) are listed here.
United States segment: compliance risk assessment
As a US-listed company, T-Mobile US conducts a risk assessment 
based on its own methodology. The outcome is regularly reported 
to the relevant bodies, including representatives of Deutsche 
Telekom AG. Before T-Mobile US selects suppliers, a centralized 
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) process screens for anti-
corruption, global sanctions, and human rights violations, as well 
as financial, security, reputational, and environmental risks. Sup-
plier risk assessments are performed on an ongoing basis depend-
ing on the risk profile of the supplier. Automated, real-time work-
flows in TPRM look for any adverse news or changes in supplier 
risk profiles and continually monitor current suppliers for policy 
violations and risks. Events or issues detected by TPRM monitoring 
are escalated to the enterprise legal, compliance, and business 
teams for review and recommended handling.
T-Mobile US expects its affiliates, business partners, suppliers, and 
their stakeholders to comply with its Human Rights Statement. 
This covers areas such as discrimination, working conditions, and 
freedom of expression. Furthermore, T-Mobile US uses its Respon-
sible Sourcing Policy to encourage suppliers to set their own sci-
ence-based emissions reduction targets, and the policy tracks 
supplier performance through regular assessments managed by 
EcoVadis.

Our approach to protecting human rights 
“Acting responsibly” is an integral part of our corporate strategy 
and therefore a requirement for all employees in our Group. Pro-
tecting human rights and environmental concerns have been a key 
part of our business activities and corporate governance for more 
than two decades.
Our commitment: We undertake to respect and promote human 
rights and environmental regulations everywhere that we are 
active; this includes our supply chains and business partners.
In order to make this commitment a reality, ever since 2016 we 
have worked to develop and implement a comprehensive program 
for human rights and environmental due diligence. This includes 
measures such as regular analysis of potential risks and the 
impacts of our business activities with respect to human rights 
and environmental concerns. We use the results of these analyses 
to avoid, minimize, or halt any negative impacts. They also enable 
us to make targeted improvements.
In our Code of Human Rights, we spell out in detail our commit-
ment to respecting and promoting human rights and environmen-
tal concerns everywhere we operate – including our suppliers and 
business partners. The code (formerly the “Code of Human Rights 
& Social Principles”) is part of our human rights policy statement 
and was expanded over the course of the reporting year. Content 
such as the existing Employee Relations Policy as well as our regu-
lations on shaping employee relations and employee concerns 
were integrated more fully. The code was adopted by the Group 
Board of Management in 2023 and subsequently published inter-
nally and externally. The code’s adoption by the management bod-
ies of the Group companies included began at the same time. This 
process is to be continued in 2024. The Code of Human Rights 
outlines our values and standards, which are set forth in greater 
detail in our internal Group Policies, instructions, and processes, 
creating our framework for action. We are guided by internation-
ally recognized human and environmental reference frameworks, 
such as the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
the core labour standards of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
At the beginning of 2023, the German Act on Corporate Due Dili-
gence in Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – 
LkSG) came into force. It sets additional requirements for us 
regarding the exercise of human rights and environment-related 
due diligence obligations – both for the entrepreneurial activities 
of our Group companies and for our global supply chain. In order to 
fulfill these requirements, we have fully adapted our due diligence 
processes and incorporated them step-by-step into the applicable 
business workflows. The new structure of the revised Code of 
Human Rights is also based on the requirements of the LkSG.
The Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG and the man-
agement of the individual Group companies are responsible for 
implementation of and compliance with our due diligence pro-
cesses. Periodic and/or event-driven (ad hoc) internal reporting on 
human rights and environment-related results in decision-making 
bodies (e.g., management bodies) ensures that it is always possi-
ble to make informed decisions. To train employees in human 
rights, we updated our existing human rights training over the 
course of the reporting year and made it available in more lan-
guages.
Deutsche Telekom created the roles of human rights officer and 
LkSG officer in order to monitor the effectiveness of LkSG risk 
management system. In accordance with a decision by the Board 
of Management, these roles will be taken on by the Vice President 
of Group Corporate Responsibility. As human rights officer, this 
person reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Management of 
Deutsche Telekom AG and has further supporting functions. Where 
required to under national regulations, Group companies have 
appointed monitoring roles in the same form for their business 
areas. The overall coordination of the human rights risk assess-
ment processes and responsibility for the overarching human 
rights strategy are taken care of by Group Corporate Responsibil-
ity.
Other new obligations arising from the LkSG are covered by exist-
ing functions. For example, Group Compliance Management is 
responsible for carrying out the compliance risk assessment. This 
risk assessment has been supplemented with additional human 
rights and environmental dimensions, making it an internal source 
for identifying risks within our own business. Employees from HR 
are responsible for the topic of “Suitable working conditions, occu-
pational health and safety.” The environmental topics are managed 
by Group Corporate Responsibility.

Risk assessment processes
We revised our risk management system in 2023 and incorporated 
it to a greater extent into all relevant business workflows. The aim 
of risk management is to recognize, prevent, or minimize human 
rights or environmental risks. It is based on individual due dili-
gence obligations, which comprise the following core elements:

Risk assessments for the entire supply chain
We want to use risk assessments to help gain transparency regard-
ing human rights and environmental risks within the supply chain. 
They should enable us to derive targeted follow-up measures and 
therefore effectively eradicate or minimize any actual or potential 
risks. As part of the LkSG risk management system, we carry out 
annual risk assessments for our own business units in the Group 
companies included as well as their direct suppliers. This came to 
248 Group companies and approx. 20 000 direct suppliers in 
2023. The T-Mobile US subgroup is excluded from this and has its 
own system for carrying out risk assessments.
When carrying out these assessments, we inspected external and 
internal information, reviewing it for plausibility and prioritizing it 
accordingly. We have included information from publicly accessi-
ble reports on country and industry risks, as well as information 
from our existing management processes. We received internal 
information from sources such as complaints processes, the 
results of the compliance risk assessment, employee surveys, 
audits, and certifications. We also take into account internal and 
external knowledge on human rights and the environment from 
the relevant experts who are appointed and reviewed each year as 
LkSG specialists. As of the year under review, we are following this 
process to create an annual risk matrix for our own business as 
well as a risk scale for suppliers which differentiates between high, 
medium, and low human rights and environmental risks in the sup-
ply chain. The results of the risk matrix are adopted by the Group 
Board of Management. They form the basis for deriving further 
measures and are furthermore incorporated into decision-making 
processes for the company. They also influence our approach to 
internal and external communication. The results for 2023 were 
published in our “Annual Policy Statement on the human rights 
strategy (Annual report LkSG)”.
In addition to the annual assessments, ad hoc risk assessments are 
carried out for the entire supply chain, including business partners. 
This also includes considering the risks before entering into a new 
business relationship such as part of company acquisitions, for 
example. In 2023, ad hoc risk assessments were triggered by situ-
ations such as extreme weather in Greece and the war in the Mid-
dle East. Such an assessment was also required within our own 
business due to the foundation of the new company, Deutsche 
Telekom Tiefbau GmbH. Other triggers included tip-offs regarding 
potential risks or violations which were submitted via our TellMe 
complaints channel.
Deriving and implementing preventive and remedial action 
As soon as a high-level risk and/or violation of a due diligence obli-
gation is identified as part of an annual or ad hoc risk assessment, 
we step in immediately with suitable, risk-based preventive and/or 
remedial action. This includes, for example, revising and imple-
menting policies or instructions. We also carry out training as 
needed and perform local, risk-based controls, such as in the form 
of Human Rights Impact Assessments or internal and external 
audits.
For example, the following measures were carried out in 2023:
	
Amending our Code of Human Rights, incl. our policy state-
ment and adjusting our expectations of employees and suppli-
ers
	
Revising and implementing Group-wide human rights training 
for all Group employees (without T-Mobile US)
	
Carrying out in-depth training for employees with a focus on 
discrimination as part of a newly devised e-learning course
	
Implementation of specialist training, such as for procurement 
roles
	
Engagement in networks and associations such as the Joint 
Alliance for CSR (JAC, formerly known as Joint Audit Coopera-
tion) for the purposes of carrying out joint audits for suppliers 
on industry-wide and/or overarching topics, the United Nations 
Global Compact, or econsense.
Based on the risk position as determined, we saw no need for a 
risk-based audit in 2023 in the form of an on-site Human Rights 
Impact Assessment for any of the Group companies in scope.
Complaints process
Our whistleblower portal TellMe provides people from all stake-
holder groups with the option to report information regarding mis-
conduct. This also provides an opportunity to give tip-offs regard-
ing misconduct affecting human rights or environmental concerns 
which relate to Deutsche Telekom or our supply chain.
The public can access the procedure through our homepage and 
via the websites of the Group companies. To ensure that everyone 
is able to access the complaints process, we accept tip-offs both 
by phone via a free, international service number as well as via 
email, post, or online submission through the aforementioned 
website – all this can be done anonymously too, if needed.
All tip-offs are taken on and processed by trained staff from our 
Compliance unit. Our experts make sure to adhere to the statutory 
requirements in doing so and do their best to protect the whistle-
blower. Insights from complaints and tip-offs are incorporated into 
the annual risk assessments.
Via the TellMe whistleblower and complaints portal, employees 
and external third parties can submit information and report com-
plaints – anonymously, if needed. A total of five tip-offs and com-
plaints relating to human rights or environmental law were 
received via TellMe in the reporting year. In particular, risks relating 
to civil engineering work for the rollout of optical fiber were 
derived from the complaints and tip-offs received and factored 
into the annual risk analysis.

Commitment to consumers
We are Europe’s leading telecommunications company in terms of 
market capitalization, revenue, and earnings. Against this back-
drop, consumer policy issues are a high priority for us.
Our key topics:
	
Ongoing measures to protect consumer data privacy (in online 
advertising, for example)
	
Improving extensive protection of minors, irrespective of the 
technology used, at the national and EU level
	
Improving customer service standards
	
Efforts to ensure consistent, understandable messaging in 
communications with our customers
	
Improving consumer protection in telecommunications (for 
example, when switching providers for fixed-line and mobile 
connections)
In all these areas, we stand for a constructive and solution-ori-
ented approach that is geared to both consumer interests and the 
interests of our company.
Political advocacy tools
Our partners in parliaments, governments, and non-profit organi-
zations need to uphold their independence and integrity. This prin-
ciple is codified in Deutsche Telekom’s Code of Conduct. Accord-
ing to this, donations to political institutions, parties, and political 
representatives are not allowed, for example. We place importance 
on factual communication, competence, credibility, and integrity. 
As a result, politicians and stakeholders feel that the information 
we provide is authentic and credible and can refer to this informa-
tion when forming their own opinions. Deutsche Telekom is regis-
tered in the official transparency register for lobbyists in Brussels. 
Deutsche Telekom has also been listed in the Lobby Register (only 
available in German) since February 28, 2022 for the representa-
tion of special interests vis-à-vis the German Bundestag and Ger-
man Government; this register was introduced in 2022 in accord-
ance with the Lobby Register Act. Within the context of our collab-
oration efforts in associations and other bodies, we feel that we 
are under the obligation to comply with all ethical codes and legal 
provisions.
In 2023, our political advocacy work focused on the following key 
issues:
	
Fiber-optic roll-out
	
5G expansion
	
Partnerships in the area of expansion
	
Regulatory procedure

Association fees: the main political advocacy outlay
Active involvement in associations is the cornerstone of our politi-
cal advocacy work. Accordingly, all the various membership fees 
(for umbrella/trade/industry associations) account for the majority 
of our outlay in this area. To make our involvement transparent, an 
overview of the main fees paid in the past three years is provided

Our guiding principle is to respect the independence and integrity 
of our political interlocutors – which is why we welcome the intro-
duction of a lobby and transparency register at the European level 
and in Germany, and registered as one of the first companies (EU) 
and on time (in Germany on February 28, 2022).

Our position on broadband: investment incentives are needed
Having a high-performance, reliable and secure broadband infra-
structure is the basis of success for all business sectors and is a 
key factor in making a business location attractive. For many years 
now, Deutsche Telekom has been making significant contributions 
in this area by investing heavily in the infrastructure for mobile 
internet and the fixed-line network, and especially in our fiber-to-
the-home (FTTH) networks. We show more commitment than any 
other company to providing full-area coverage, including in rural 
areas.
In order to drive network expansion, network operators in Germany 
need investment incentives, legal and regulatory planning security, 
and technological freedom of action. That enables them to 
respond flexibly to the circumstances of enterprises and house-
holds and meet political, economic, and social requirements. Only 
under these preconditions can we fully harness the potential for 
cost-effective private network expansion using all available tech-
nologies. When it comes to areas where cost-effective broadband 
expansion is not possible, it is up to the public sector to ensure 
that white spots are eliminated by providing supplier-neutral fund-
ing programs and exercising sound judgment. Legal frameworks 
and regulatory practice need to actively support private-sector 
investment in new fiber-optic networks and prevent unnecessary 
financial burdens and red tape for the network operators investing 
in networks.
In view of the fact that the internet and telecommunications mar-
kets are converging rapidly, and in light of the growing market and 
financial power of the dominant global players providing cloud 
services online, the sector-specific regulation of telecommunica-
tions that has been pursued to date is creating more and more of 
an imbalance. The same laws and regulations that apply to tele-
communications companies also need to apply to internet compa-
nies providing the same services. The objective here must be to 
create equal competitive conditions and enable fair distribution of 
the financial burden involved in broadband expansion.
Our position on network neutrality: the internet should stay 
open
As part of the EU Telecoms Package, regulations on the open inter-
net were adopted and came into effect on April 30, 2016. The reg-
ulations particularly address permitted traffic management and 
transparency requirements and limit commercial product and ser-
vice differentiation on the internet.
Deutsche Telekom remains committed to preserving an open 
internet. We are continuing to expand our infrastructure so that we 
can cope with rapidly increasing amounts of data traffic and facili-
tate innovation in our network. As a result, we are satisfying our

customers’ growing demands and meeting the expectations of 
online content and application providers, who want to be able to 
provide services meeting high technical-quality standards both 
now and in the future.
We are developing an innovative network architecture – 5G net-
works – which can better and more flexibly meet the various trans-
mission quality requirements of specific services. We thereby fulfill 
business and regulatory requirements and enable innovation in the 
services we offer on our networks. Content will not be controlled, 
however. When competing with other network operators, we will 
also continue to market services with guaranteed quality features 
exclusively on a non-discriminatory basis.

GRI Index
Deutsche Telekom’s 2023 CR Report was created in line with the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and in agreement with 
the option “in accordance” with GRI. So our high demands on 
transparency are maintained. The reported information relates to 
the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023.
In the GRI content index, we refer to content pertaining to general 
and specific standard disclosures and explain the content when 
necessary. The standard disclosures are based on the very relevant 
aspects identified in our materiality process. Selected content 
from various action areas has been reviewed in this regard; such 
content is marked in the index with [ 
 Data reviewed by 
Deloitte]. The index also contains links and explanations relative to 
other GRI aspects that are covered in the report.
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) 
There are various standards for CR reporting for companies. Our 
CR report has been based on reporting in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), in particular, for nearly 20 years. 
Our annual report has met the European requirements for CR 
reporting since 2017. We have been making our contribution 
toward reaching the SDGs transparent in our reporting since 2017 
as well. To satisfy the growing interest of our stakeholders in com-
parable sustainability information, we have published an additional 
index on the sustainability standards of the Sustainability Account-
ing Standards Board (SASB) in our CR report since 2021 – with an 
industry-specific focus on the information and communications 
technology sector.
In the SASB index, we explain how we satisfy the industry-specific 
SASB criteria or link to passages in our sustainability communica-
tion where we explain how we satisfy them. In addition, we list the 
SASB criteria at relevant locations within the present report.
We welcome the growing attention being given to sustainability 
issues, and of course are happy to readily meet growing transpar-
ency requirements. At the same time, we are aware of announced 
efforts to consolidate various relevant standards and frameworks. 
Principle Adverse Impacts (PAIs)
The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) is intended 
to create more transparency regarding the extent to which finan-
cial products are sustainable. We therefore would like to use a 
table to illustrate for our investors and financial services providers 
the most important indicators according to the SFDR (Principal 
Adverse Impacts, PAIs) of their investment decisions or policies on 
sustainability aspects. This includes environmental, social and 
employee concerns as well as protecting human rights and fight-
ing corruption and bribery. For the reporting year, we focused on 
the mandatory indicators for financial institutions in the disclosure 
of PAIs. In future, we will evaluate the extent to which we can also 
report other PAIs.
Indicators for telecommunications providers from the GSM 
Association (GSMA)
The indicators outlined by the GSM Association (GSMA; worldwide 
association of mobile communications providers) are intended to 
create a uniform sustainability standard for the telecommunica-
tions industry and make comparisons within the industry easier. 
Ten of the most important KPIs for the industry have been selected 
within the four categories of environment, digital participation, 
digital integrity, and supply chain. The KPIs are based on standards 
such as GRI and SASB, which have long been applied by Deutsche 
Telekom, too. We welcome GSMA using these sector-specific, 
established standards and reveal in the following table the extent 
to which our reporting is already in keeping with these indicators.
UN Global Compact – Communication on Progress
Deutsche Telekom was one of the founding members of UN Global 
Compact over 20 years ago. Since then, we have communicated 
our efforts for implementing its ten principles in our annual Com-
munication on Progress (CoP). Our current Communication on Pro-
gress and communications from years gone by can be found here.

German Sustainability Code
The German Sustainability Code has been approved by the Federal 
Government’s Council for Sustainable Development. Deutsche 
Telekom was one of the first companies to accede to the Sustaina-
bility Code. The German Sustainability Code aims to make compa-
nies’ commitments to sustainability transparent and comparable 
under a binding framework. For the 2023 reporting year, we will 
not be publishing a declaration of conformity with the German 
Sustainability Code for the first time, as we are focusing on prepar-
ing for future reporting in accordance with the CSRD. You can find 
the statements from previous years on the German Sustainability 
Code website under “Deutsche Telekom AG.”

the most sustainable telecommunications company. This award 
honors business engagement in key areas of transformation in 
which there is a particular need for action. These areas reflect the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations and 
the targets of the German government’s sustainability strategy: 
climate, nature, resources, value chain, and society.
ESG TRANSPARENCY AWARD: award for transparent reporting
In the year under review, we won the ESG TRANSPARENCY 
AWARD for our transparent reporting on our progress, initiatives, 
and projects in the environmental, social, and governance areas. 
This award honors the transparent presentation of all sustainability 
measures in the framework of verifiable ESG reporting, as well as 
the integration of forward-looking sustainability concepts in enter-
prise strategies.
CSRD readiness: award for the best climate reporting among 
DAX 40 companies
In 2023, we were honored with the “Building Public Trust Award” 
for the third time (after 2017 and 2020) for outstanding, consist-
ent sustainability reporting among DAX 40 companies. The topics 
of EU taxonomy, climate goals, and CSRD readiness received spe-
cial mention.
Second place in the CSR benchmark for best digital sustainabil-
ity communication
We once again took second place in the NetFederation Corporate 
Social Responsibility (CSR) benchmark in 2023. At 815 points, we 
were just three points behind the first-place winner and 97 points 
ahead of third place. The criteria analyzed are assigned to the 
three categories “Attitude and credibility,” “Reporting and publica-
tions,” and “Facts and KPIs.” The NetFed benchmark is an annual 
study on the current status of digital sustainability communication.
Award for climate protection from CDP
On behalf of investors, the non-governmental organization CDP 
regularly evaluates the climate protection activities of listed com-
panies worldwide and compiles an index of the leading companies, 
the Climate “A-List”. In this list, Deutsche Telekom is represented 
for the eighth time in a row for the year 2023.
Gold and Honors ARC Awards for our CR Report
At the ARC Awards 2023, our Corporate Responsibility Report won 
gold in the category “Interactive Annual Report: CSR – Corporate 
Social Responsibility Award” and Honors in the category “Cover/
Home Page: Corporate Social Responsibility Award.” Creativity, 
innovation, and the clarity and effectiveness of communication 
were key criteria mentioned in the decision.
Awards for sustainable products and services
Speedport Smart 4 and Speedhome WLAN awarded TÜV 
eco-label
Deutsche Telekom’s Speedport Smart 4 and Speedhome WLAN 
routers were awarded the certification “Green Product” by TÜV 
Rheinland. The sustainability properties of the devices have thus 
been certified by a neutral body. They meet the strict criteria of 
TÜV and prevailed in all categories. In addition to responsible han-
dling of chemical substances, both products scored points with 
their resource efficiency with regard to energy, recycling, and 
durability. TÜV Rheinland also gave favorable ratings to the carbon 
footprint and compliance with social standards, particularly in pro-
duction.
The Representative Office in Berlin is certified as a Sustainable 
Partner
Deutsche Telekom’s Representative Office in Berlin makes event 
facilities available to internal and external groups/organizations. In 
the year under review, it was recognized by the VisitBerlin Conven-
tion Office as a Sustainable Partner in its top category, “Leader,” for 
the fifth time running. The Office’s sustainability performance was 
audited in four categories: governance, risk & compliance; environ-
mental aspects; social aspects; and economic aspects.
Awards for sustainable finance
Best European telco in the S&P assessment
In 2023, we qualified for the renowned sustainability indexes “Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index World” (DJSI World) and “Dow Jones

row. DJSI World represents the top 10 percent of the largest 2 500 
companies in the S&P Global BMI based on long-term economic, 
environmental and social criteria. In 2023, we took first place in 
the European index.
Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index
In the year under review, we were again one of 484 companies 
selected for the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index (GEI). The GEI 
measures and evaluates gender-equality performance in a total of 
five areas: female leadership and talent pipeline; equal pay and 
gender pay parity; inclusive culture; anti-sexual harassment poli-
cies; and pro-women brand.

Digital Inclusion Benchmark
Our ambitions and actions for digital participation and inclusion in 
society were recognized with the award of third place in the Digital 
Inclusion Benchmark 2023 – improving our ranking by four spots 
compared to the previous year. In this ranking, the World Bench-
mark Alliance rates the 200 most influential digital tech compa-
nies in the world.
Awards for Teachtoday
In 2023, the Teachtoday initiative once again won two prizes at the 
Comenius EduMedia Awards, which recognize digital educational 
media. An international panel of scientists, specialists, and educa-
tion practitioners examined over 200 different educational media. 
The Teachtoday portal and the online SCROLLER magazine for kids 
won the panel over with their outstanding educational and media 
quality and won prizes in the categories “IT, communication, and 
media education” and “General multimedia products.”
Awards for our No Hate Speech initiative
With our No Hate Speech initiative, we are working to ensure that 
people have nothing to worry about as they navigate cyberspace. 
Via channels such as video and radio spots, workshops and pod-
casts, we are calling attention to hate speech, social media out-
rage and cyberbullying, and encouraging people to show “civil 
courage online” and stand up against such negative trends. We 
received several awards for this campaign:
	
Awards for “The choir against hate” ad 
Spotlight Festival 2023: Two bronze awards in the category 
“Social Impact” – both the award from the expert panel and 
the audience prize 
	
In 2023, we won several awards for our ad entitled  
“The choir against hate.” We wanted to use this ad to show 
that, together, we can be louder than online hate speech.
	
ADC 2023: Third place in the “Brand Building” category
	
2023 German Award for Sustainability Projects 
We took first place in the “Campaign” category in the 2023 
German Award for Sustainability Projects (Deutscher Award für 
Nachhaltigkeitsprojekte 2023) with our No Hate Speech initia-
tive. The panel assessed four focus areas: effectiveness/bene-
fits of the project, innovation, relevance to the core business of 
the company and industry, and timeliness.
	
Brands Award 2023 
Our No Hate speech” initiative also won the 2023 Brands 
Award (Marken-Award 2023) in the category “Social commit-
ment.” The magazine “absatzwirtschaft” (“marketing”) and the 
German Federal Association of Marketing Clubs (Bundesver-
band Marketing Clubs – BVMC) award this prize for excellence 
in brand management.
Awards for our commitment in the area of diversity
Among the European top 10 in the FT-Statista Diversity  
Ranking 
In 2023, we took tenth place among 850 European companies in 
the FT-Statista Diversity Ranking and second place among the 146 
German companies surveyed. This ranking, compiled by the Finan-
cial Times and Statista, is determined based on a survey of 
employees and three additional indicators: the share of women in 
management positions, communications made in favor of diver-
sity, and an externally calculated diversity value from a leading 
provider of data on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Socially responsible investment
SRI investment products consist of securities from companies that 
have passed an audit based on environmental, social, and govern-
ance (ESG) criteria. The development of demand from socially 
responsible investors for T-Shares serves as an indicator we can 
use to assess our sustainability performance.
With our Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) ESG KPI, we 
measure how the financial markets perceive our CR activities.
The concept behind the United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) continues to attract attention on the part of inves-
tors. With a view, in part, to evaluating our operations in light of the 
SDGs, we have introduced a process for assessing the impacts of 
projects, products, and measures.
The SFDR (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation) is also rele-
vant for Deutsche Telekom. It applies primarily to financial institu-
tions that should incorporate sustainability factors into their deci-
sion-making processes concerning investments and have to col-
lect relevant data regarding the sustainability impacts of their 
investments. Enterprises outside the financial sector are also 
affected and for that reason we have set out in tabular format for 
our investors and financial service providers the Principal Adverse 
Impacts (PAIs) of their investment decisions or guidelines in terms 
of sustainability aspects.
T-Shares in sustainability ratings and indexes
As part of our CR strategy, we have taken part successfully for 
many years in ESG ratings, which we select based on reputation, 
relevance, and independence. When rating agencies give high 
marks to our social and ecological commitment, the T-Share is 
included in the financial market's sustainability indexes.
In 2023, the T-Share was again listed on leading sustainability 
indexes, including S&P Global’s prominent, and CSA-based, DJSI 
World and DJSI Europe. Our shares were also listed yet again on 
the FTSE4Good Index Series (for the twelfth year running) and the 
STOXX Global ESG Leaders. We are also still listed on the Euronext 
Indexes.

ESG KPI “Socially Responsible Investment (SRI)”
More and more investors take into account sustainability aspects 
of their investments (Socially Responsible Investments, SRI). SRI 
investment products consist of securities from companies that 
have passed an audit based on environmental, social, and govern-
ance (ESG) criteria. The development of demand from socially 
responsible investors for T-Shares serves as an indicator we can 
use to assess our sustainability performance. The ESG KPI “Socially 
Responsible Investment” indicates the proportion of shares in 
Deutsche Telekom held by these kinds of investors.
Our commitment to greater sustainability pays off: As of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, around 32 percent of all T-Shares were held by 
investors who take environmental, social, and corporate govern-
ance criteria into account for their investment strategy; the same 
figure was just 31.3 percent in the previous year. (Source: Nasdaq)

Sustainable capital investments & bond issues
In the past years, sustainability criteria have become increasingly 
important, both politically and economically, with respect to capi-
tal investments. And we are among those seeking to make our 
capital investments increasingly sustainability-oriented. This 
applies both to money that we invest and to bonds that we issue 
for the purpose of raising borrowed capital for investments. To this 
end, we regularly evaluate financing models that are attractive and 
sustainable, working in close consultation with our Group units 
Corporate Responsibility and Treasury (financial management).
Sustainable capital investment 
Since 2019, Deutsche Telekom’s capital investments (“DT Trust”) 
have been geared toward ecological and social standards. The DT 
Trust is based on the criteria for the Government Pension Fund 
Norway (“Norges”). Among other things, we exclude companies 
that violate human rights, manufacture certain weapons, or whose 
core business is considered harmful to the environment.
EU taxonomy: compliance
The EU Taxonomy Regulation is the outcome of a European regula-
tory initiative. The goal of the Regulation is to promote investment 
in companies that are managed responsibly and that are involved 
in sustainable economic activities. The EU Taxonomy aims to cre-
ate a uniform understanding of which activities and investments 
are sustainable. For this, the European Commission has defined 
clear criteria with precise metrics. This is intended to help inves-
tors to assess whether a company in which they want to invest 
operates sustainably. Since 2021, the businesses affected have 
had an obligation to report on how much of their turnover comes 
from the economic activities covered by the EU Taxonomy. In addi-
tion, companies must disclose the extent to which they invest in 
these economic activities, and what level of operating expenditure 
is associated with these activities.
Six environmental objectives 
The first criteria regarding which economic activities are to be 
classed as environmentally sustainable in accordance with the EU 
Taxonomy were adopted by the European Commission in 2022. 
They apply to the taxonomy environmental objectives “Climate 
change mitigation” (CCM) and “Climate change adaptation” (CCA). 
There are also additional taxonomy environmental objectives in 
the areas of “Water and marine resources” (WTR), “Circular econ-
omy” (CE), “Pollution prevention and control” (PPC), and “Biodiver-
sity and ecosystems” (BIO). The European Commission adopted 
criteria for these objectives in June 2023, which were required to 
be applied for the first time for the 2023 reporting year.
The EU Taxonomy distinguishes between economic activities that 
are “taxonomy-eligible” and “taxonomy-aligned”:

“Taxonomy-eligible” economic activities are those activities for 
which concrete sustainability criteria are listed in the EU Taxon-
omy [Annexes to EU Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139, 
(EU) 2022/1214, (EU) 2023/2485, and (EU) 2023/2486]. 

“Taxonomy-aligned” economic activities are those activities 
that are fully compliant with the sustainability criteria listed in 
the EU Taxonomy [Annexes to EU Delegated Regulations (EU) 
2021/2139, (EU) 2022/1214, (EU) 2023/2485, and (EU) 
2023/2486]. To be taxonomy-aligned, an economic activity 
must make a substantial contribution to one of the aforemen-
tioned six environmental objectives while at the same time 
doing no significant harm (DNSH) to any of the other objec-
tives. In addition, the company must meet the minimum social 
standards defined in the Taxonomy Regulation. The diagram 
below provides a summary of the taxonomy requirements:

Requirements of the EU taxonomy = Taxonomy-eligible 
economic activities
Substantial contribution
to at least one of the six environmental objectives of the 
EU Taxonomy:
1. Climate change mitigation (CCM)
2. Climate change adaptation (CCA)
3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine 
resources (WTR)
4. The transition to a circular economy (CE)
5. Pollution prevention and control (PPC)
6. Biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)
Do no significant harm
An activity can only be considered to contribute to one of the six 
objectives if it has no other significant negative environmental 
impact (“Do no significant harm” principle).
Compliance with minimum safeguards
The minimum safeguards are social requirements in accordance 
with

the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,

the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights,

the Core Labour Standards of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO),

and the International Bill of Human Rights.
Implementation at Deutsche Telekom 
The following economic activities of Deutsche Telekom are cur-
rently taxonomy-eligible [the activity numbers refer to Annexe I of 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, which describes the crite-
ria for the “Climate change mitigation (CCM)” environmental 
objective, as well as to Annexe II of Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2023/2486, which lists the criteria for the “Circular economy (CE)” 
environmental objective]:

Data processing, hosting and related activities (CCM 8.1)

Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions (CCM 8.2)

Product-as-a-service and other circular use and result-oriented 
service models (CE 5.5): Lease of terminal equipment to busi-
ness customers and consumers 

Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial 
vehicles (CCM 6.5): Deutsche Telekom’s vehicle fleet (cross-
cutting activity)
In the reporting year, we made minor changes to the application of 
materiality thresholds compared with the prior year. That is why 
we no longer report the activity “Infrastructure enabling low-car-
bon road transport and public transport “(CCM 6.15), which 
relates to the charging solutions of our Comfort Charge subsidiary 
for electric vehicles. A complete overview of the economic activi-
ties that are currently part of the EU Taxonomy is available using 
the EU Taxonomy Compass.
With the exception of the activity “Product-as-a-service and other 
circular use and result-oriented service models (CE 5.5),” a com-
prehensive review was conducted for all of Deutsche Telekom’s 
taxonomy-eligible activities to determine whether they can also be 
classified as taxonomy-aligned. We conducted an initial analysis of 
taxonomy eligibility for activity CE 5.5. We will continue to deepen 
this analysis and publish the results – as required by law – in 2025 
for the 2024 reporting year. 
A taxonomy criterion that applies to all activities is the climate risk 
analysis, which was performed at Group level. In connection with 
the taxonomy-eligible activities, we have identified individual local 
climate risks, although these are mitigated by existing adaptation 
measures. The criteria for doing no harm to environmental objec-
tive “Climate change adaptation” (CCA) are therefore met. The 
only exception to this is the United States operating segment, 
where management of climate risks is still in the process of being 
developed and therefore does not yet fully meet the requirements 
of the EU Taxonomy. In any case, there were no taxonomy-eligible 
activities carried out to any significant extent in the United States 
operating segment in the reporting year. 
We ensure compliance with minimum social standards for all tax-
onomy-eligible activities through a Group-wide management sys-
tem. The standards refer to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, including the ILO Core Conventions and the International 
Bill of Human Rights. We perform our human-rights-related due 
diligence obligations using a risk-based management system 
encompassing both the Group and our supply chain. We also 
maintain a process of trust-based dialog with employees’ repre-
sentatives and trade unions.
You will find comprehensive information on checking for taxonomy 
alignment in the relevant sections of the CR Report and the non-
financial statement in our Annual Report. 
The following table provides an overview of our taxonomy-eligible 
and taxonomy-aligned economic activities for the reporting year. It

ble percentage of Group turnover, capital expenditure, and operat-
ing expenditure.

EU taxonomy KPIs – taxonomy-eligibility and -alignment of the 
economic activities of the Deutsche Telekom Group
Deutsche Telekom Group in 2023
* The analysis of the economic activity “Product-as-a-service and other circular 
use- and result-oriented service models” (CE 5.5) was limited to taxonomy eli-
gibility only in 2023. The analysis of taxonomy alignment pursuant to Dele-
gated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 will take place in the 2024 financial year.
** Due to a change in application of the materiality assessment, turnover in 
connection with the taxonomy-eligible economic activity “Infrastructure ena-
bling low-carbon road transport and public transport” (CCM 6.15) is no longer 
being reported in the 2023 financial year.

65
The total figures of the Group underlying the calculation in accord-
ance with the EU Taxonomy for the reporting year were EUR 112.0 
billion (2022: EUR 114.2 billion) for turnover, EUR 24.3 billion 
(2022: EUR 38.5 billion) for capital expenditure, and EUR 0.4 bil-
lion (2022: EUR 0.4 billion) for operating expenditure. Turnover 
and capital expenditure were determined on the basis of the con-
solidated financial statements. Operating expenditure relevant to 
the EU Taxonomy represents only a small proportion of total oper-
ating expenditure. This includes costs that relate to research and 
development; building remediation measures; short-term leases; 
maintenance and repair; and any other direct expenditures relating 
to the day-to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment. 
You will find more information on the reporting principles and KPIs 
for the EU Taxonomy in the non-financial statement in our Annual 
Report.
As Deutsche Telekom’s core business is not yet adequately cov-
ered by the criteria in the EU Taxonomy, an aggregate view of the 
taxonomy eligibility of all economic activities results again in 2023 
in very low proportions of taxonomy-eligible turnover (2.5 per-
cent; 2022: 1.8 percent), capital expenditure (2.1 percent; 2022: 
0.8 percent), and operating expenditure (33.2 percent; 2022: 
33.5 percent) for the Deutsche Telekom Group. The slight 
increase in turnover and capital expenditure compared with the 
prior year is mainly attributable to the first-time disclosure of tax-
onomy-eligible turnover and capital expenditure from the lease of 
terminal equipment in accordance with economic activity CE 5.5.
In the 2023 financial year, the taxonomy-aligned proportion of 
all economic activities of the Deutsche Telekom Group was 
0.2 percent (2022: 0.5 percent) of turnover, 0.0 percent (2022: 
0.0 percent) of capital expenditure, and 0.5 percent (2022: 
0.4 percent) of operating expenditure. The taxonomy-aligned 
proportion is attributable to economic activity CCM 8.2 “Data-
driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions.” The decline in tax-
onomy-aligned turnover is due mainly to the life-cycle analysis 
required by the Taxonomy. The industry benchmarks against which 
the greenhouse gas savings of our cloud solutions are compared 
were updated for this analysis in the reporting year. 
In relation to the Systems Solutions segment, the taxonomy-
aligned proportion of turnover is 3.6 percent (2022: 12.3 percent), 
0.0 percent for capital expenditure (2022: 0.1 percent), and  
0.0 percent for operating expenditure (2022: 0.8 percent). 
You will find more information in the sections on taxonomy activi-
ties CCM 8.1, CCM 8.2, and CE 5.5.
EU taxonomy: industry view and outlook
Further development
The bulk of our business model is not yet included in the EU Taxon-
omy because the Taxonomy does not include criteria for the eco-
nomic activity “Provision and operation of a network infrastructure 
for telecommunications.” We can therefore only reflect the added 
value of our activities for digitalization and the associated environ-
mental benefits within the EU Taxonomy to a very limited extent. 
We are helping to reduce carbon emissions by increasing the 
energy efficiency of our network infrastructure and investing in the 
build-out of state-of-the-art, energy-efficient networks. At the 
same time, the network infrastructure forms the basis needed for 
digital solutions that contribute to CO₂ savings in other sectors of 
the economy. For this reason, we are actively involved in various 
business and industry associations to ensure that relevant and 
appropriate criteria for our network infrastructure are added to the 
EU Taxonomy. We have set out our position in a range of position 
papers, for example, here with ETNO.
In particular, we took part in the joint feedback process of the 
European Commission and the Platform on Sustainable Finance on 
the EU Taxonomy in 2023. The Sustainable Finance working group 
of the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Associa-
tion (ETNO) and the Global System for Mobile Communications 
Association (GSMA) has developed a proposal for taxonomy crite-
ria at Deutsche Telekom’s initiative. These criteria can provide 
stronger incentives for investments in climate change mitigation in 
the area of network build-out and operation for fixed and mobile 
networks. This industry proposal will be evaluated by the Platform 
on Sustainable Finance and the European Commission in the 
course of 2024. 
In addition to EGNO and GSMA, we are active within the European 
Round Table (ERT), and at national level we are part of the econ-
sense network and several other organizations and stakeholder 
dialogs.
In its current form, the EU Taxonomy concentrates on environmen-
tal objectives. It is to be expanded in the future with the inclusion 
of a “social taxonomy.” The aim of this is to give businesses the 
opportunity to reflect their social contributions, too. Given the 
demanding regulatory environment currently facing businesses, 
these plans have been temporarily suspended. However, in Octo-
ber 2022, the Platform on Sustainable Finance expert committee 
took the initial step of compiling a proposal for fleshing out the 
minimum social standards that are already part of the EU Taxon-
omy. The experts suggest focusing on the following areas: respect 
for human and labor rights, anti-corruption, taxes, and fair compe-
tition. It is not yet clear to what extent the European Commission 
will make these expert recommendations legally binding.
The application of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Direc-
tive, which entered into force on January 5, 2023, will progres-
sively increase the number of businesses that are obligated to dis-
close taxonomy-related information. Going forward, this will help 
us to check the taxonomy alignment of goods and services we 
purchase, as required by the EU Taxonomy.

Taxonomy activity 8.1: Data processing, hosting and related 
activities
We cover the taxonomy-eligible economic activity “Data process-
ing, hosting and related activities” (CCM 8.1) with our Systems 
Solutions segment. As well as data centers operated by T‑Systems, 
we also included data centers operated on co-locations in the 
evaluation of taxonomy eligibility. 
The economic activity CCM 8.1 accounts for the largest propor-
tion of taxonomy-eligible turnover, investment expenditure, and 
operating expenditure: Taxonomy-eligible business activities for 
data processing and hosting amounted to 1.0 percent of turnover 
in 2023 (2022: 1.0 percent), 0.9 percent of capital expenditure 
(2022: 0.4 percent), and 19.1 percent (2022: 19.0 percent) of 
direct expenses (based on the relevant Group total figures). To 
illustrate taxonomy eligibility at segment level, too, we also report 
supplementary KPIs for the Systems Solutions segment. The tax-
onomy-eligible proportion is 35.0 percent (2022: 36 percent) in 
relation to the external turnover of the segment, and 66.0 percent 
(2022: 62.6 percent) in relation to capital expenditure.
Data centers must comply with the European Code of Conduct for 
Energy Efficiency in Data Centres to be considered as making a 
substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in accord-
ance with the EU Taxonomy. Five of the eight sites operated 
directly by T‑Systems currently comply with this Code of Conduct. 
Compliance with the Code of Conduct has not yet undergone 
external auditing, which is a requirement of the EU Taxonomy. We 
are therefore classifying the data centers used for economic activ-
ity CCM 8.1 as non-taxonomy-aligned in the reporting year. 
In addition, the EU Taxonomy stipulates that the refrigerants used 
in data center cooling systems may not exceed a global warming 
potential value of 675. This criterion is currently met by one data 
center that was fully refurbished in 2022. At present, the other 
sites still use industry-typical refrigerants that meet the criteria of 
the EU Regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases. The taxon-
omy-aligned turnover, capital expenditure, and operating expendi-
ture for economic activity CCM 8.1 are therefore all 0.0 percent.
We will make the change to taxonomy-aligned refrigerants as part 
of the regular refurbishment program for our data centers. We will 
carefully review the individual data centers’ compliance with the 
criteria for preventing significant harm to the remaining environ-
mental objectives in each case as soon as they fulfill the aforemen-
tioned climate change mitigation requirements in full. This will 
enable us to continually increase the taxonomy alignment of our 
data centers. 
Taxonomy activity 8.2: Data-driven solutions for GHG 
emissions reductions
We associate those solutions and products that are predominantly 
aimed at the provision of data and analytics enabling GHG emis-
sion reductions with the economic activity Data-driven solutions 
for GHG emissions reductions (CCM 8.2). These are, in particular, 
solutions and products that we have incorporated into our Enable-
ment Factor and Sustainable Revenue Share ESG KPIs, and/or that 
have been awarded our #GreenMagenta label. 
We have identified the following taxonomy-eligible services within 
our Group-wide business activities:
	
Business-related video conferences (save travel-induced CO₂ 
emissions)
	
Workplace and cloud solutions (increase energy efficiency by 
improving server utilization)
	
IoT solutions (save CO₂ emissions through route optimization, 
for example)
We provide these services to a significant financial extent in the 
Germany segment, in our major subsidiaries in the Europe seg-
ment, and in the Systems Solutions segment.Taxonomy-eligible 
solutions under economic activity CCM 8.2 represent 0.8 percent 
(2022: 0.8 percent) of turnover.
A life-cycle analysis is required as evidence of taxonomy align-
ment. This must show that a solution results in substantial green-
house gas emission reductions both over and beyond its entire life 
cycle in comparison with the relevant reference solution available 
on the market. We understand reference solutions to be alternative 
solutions that would typically be used in a company in our foot-
print markets. This assumes that the companies are aligned with 
best practices. The technical screening criteria do not stipulate a 
specific threshold for “substantial” reductions in greenhouse gases 
in comparison with the reference solution. In the prior year, we 
therefore defined a threshold based on scientific findings. We rate 
greenhouse gas reductions resulting from taxonomy-eligible solu-
tions exceeding this threshold value as “substantial.” The requisite 
life-cycle analyses have been prepared for business-related video 
conference solutions and for the cloud solutions Future Cloud 
Infrastructure, Open Telekom Cloud, and SAP Cloud Services. To 
date, we have not prepared a life-cycle analysis for the IoT solu-
tions and therefore we do not report them as taxonomy-aligned for 
the reporting year.
In contrast to the prior year, the taxonomy-eligible business-
related web conferencing solutions were analyzed by comparing 
them with hybrid meetings to take account of market trends 
(previous year: in-person meetings). Significant greenhouse gas 
savings were demonstrated. In comparison with hybrid meetings, 
purely virtual meetings contribute to greenhouse gas savings of 
62 percent (small meetings with fewer than five participants) or 
32 percent (large meetings with more than five participants). 
Of the workplace and cloud solutions examined, the life-cycle 
analysis of the Future Cloud Infrastructure (including the SAP 
Cloud Services run on this infrastructure) shows that greenhouse 
gas emissions reductions of 9.7 percent (in comparison with 
decentralized data centers operated by our customers them-
selves) can be achieved. Future Cloud Infrastructure is based on 
an infrastructure-as-a-service model: the customer’s IT systems 
are brought together on a platform hosted by T-Systems. Central-
izing the service in this way not only reduces the consumption of 
materials for hardware but, thanks to the highly energy-efficient 
operation of our data centers, also cuts greenhouse gas emissions. 
Management & facts
Economy
Sustainable finance

67
However, the demonstrated greenhouse gas reductions of 9.7 per-
cent are lower than the threshold value defined in the prior year. 
This is because the industry benchmarks against which we com-
pared our solutions were updated. Future Cloud Infrastructure and 
SAP Cloud Services cannot therefore be reported as taxonomy-
aligned for the 2023 financial year.
The Open Telekom Cloud is also offered as an infrastructure-as-a-
service model. Via a platform operated by T-Systems, businesses 
can flexibly purchase computing capacity, memory resources, and 
network resources, among other things. Improved server utilization 
and the highly energy-efficient operation of our data centers mean 
that, according to the life-cycle analysis, using the Open Telekom 
Cloud leads to savings in greenhouse gas emissions of 47 percent 
in comparison with the reference scenario. This scenario is based 
on the assumption that our customers use their own, decentralized 
server infrastructure for storing and processing data, rather than 
the cloud solution. In view of the demonstrated reduction in green-
house gases, we classify all web conferencing solutions and the 
Open Telekom Cloud included in the life-cycle analysis as taxon-
omy-aligned.
For the aforementioned solutions, we exclusively use infrastructure 
located in Germany. The requirements for the “Circular economy” 
(CE) conform to current EU legislation, which we implement as 
part of our environment management activities at our EU sites. We 
also require our business partners to provide evidence that the 
hardware used in the data centers is actually reconditioned or 
recycled at the end of its service life. The taxonomy-aligned solu-
tions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions represent 0.2 percent 
(2022: 0.5 percent) of turnover, 0.0 percent of capital expenditure 
(2022: 0.0 percent), and 0.5 percent (2022: 0.4 percent) of oper-
ating expenditure. For the Systems Solutions segment, the taxon-
omy-aligned proportion of turnover was 3.6 percent (2022: 12.3 
percent), 0.0 percent of capital expenditure (2022: 0.1 percent), 
and 0.0 percent of operating expenditure (2022: 0.8 percent).
Result including cloud solutions with greenhouse gas reduction 
potential of around 10 percent
Taking the Future Cloud Infrastructure and SAP Cloud Services 
cloud solutions additionally into account, which reduced green-
house gas emissions by 9.7 percent according to the life-cycle 
analysis, the taxonomy-aligned proportion for the Group would be 
0.5 percent (turnover), 0.0 percent (capital expenditure), and 0.5 
percent (operating expenditure). For the Systems Solutions oper-
ating segment, including Future Cloud Infrastructure and SAP 
Cloud Services would lead to a proportion of 11.5 percent (turno-
ver), 0.0 percent (capital expenditure), and 0.4 percent (operating 
expenditure). 
Taxonomy activity CE 5.5: Product-as-a-service and other 
circular use and result-oriented service models
Following the expansion of the EU Taxonomy in 2023, we have 
identified a taxonomy-eligible economic activity that is assigned 
to the “Circular economy” (CE) environmental objective. We record 
the lease of terminal equipment such as routers or fixed-network 
telephones to business customers and consumers in the Germany 
operating segment under the taxonomy-eligible economic activity 
“Product-as-a-service and other circular use and result-oriented 
service models” (CE 5.5). We take back the leased devices from 
our customers and remanufacture them so that they can be used 
for as long as possible. We generated relevant taxonomy-eligible 
turnover from the lease of terminal equipment in accordance with 
economic activity CE 5.5 that accounted for 0.6 percent of the 
Group’s total turnover. This economic activity is additionally asso-
ciated with relevant capital expenditure of 0.7 percent, based on 
the total figures for the Group. As required by law, we will publish 
information on taxonomy alignment for economic activity CE 5.5 
for the reporting year 2024 starting in 2025.
Additional taxonomy activities (e-mobility)
Deutsche Telekom has a vehicle fleet that includes both company 
cars and service vehicles. The economic activity “Transport by 
motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles” (CCM 
6.5) is therefore relevant as a cross-cutting activity with a support-
ing function for our core business.
As we are pushing forward with the transition to a fully electric 
fleet, especially in Germany and the EU, some of the new vehicles 
purchased already meet the CO₂ thresholds set by the EU Taxon-
omy. We were also able to provide evidence of the alignment of 
these vehicles with the other key EU Taxonomy requirements, 
which are based on current EU legislation for new vehicles. As the 
choice of tires is left to the vehicle users themselves, we could not 
provide evidence of the taxonomy alignment of tires for the report-
ing year. We therefore report capital expenditure associated with 
our vehicle fleet as non-taxonomy-aligned. 
Investor communication
We have observed that investors are increasingly incorporating 
SRI approaches in their investment strategies. In addition, inves-
tors, analysts, and rating agencies are increasingly inquiring more 
specifically about our CR activities. To meet these requests, we use 
different formats – both in our reporting and for direct dialog. In 
2023, we held more discussions with investors on this issue than 
ever before, testimony to a substantial increase in interest.
We publish this CR report annually. The Management and Facts 
section provides readers with detailed information that helps them 
assess our CR performance. In addition, we have also prepared 
under “Specials” relevant sustainability issues in a straightforward, 
clear manner for a broad readership. Our annual report also 
includes a non-financial statement that allows us to meet the cur-
rent EU requirements for sustainability reporting. We also offer 
ESG information for financial market players on our company web-
site, under “Responsibility”, and on our investor relations portal, 
under “Socially Responsible investment”. In addition, we provide 
social indicators in our HR Factbook. This year we are also report-
ing for the first time the requirements from the SFDR as a service 
for our investors by providing an overview of the PAIs (Principal 
Adverse Impacts).
We strive to engage in personal dialog with investors and regularly 
hold national and international information events as SRI road-
shows. We also regularly take part in SRI conferences or meetings, 
and, upon request, present our CR strategy as best practice.

We also keep interested investors up-to-date on ESG issues in 
quarterly presentations and also answer numerous related direct 
inquiries. In the year under review, we again ran our investor dia-
logs, including our SRI roadshows, virtually entirely online.
Taxes
The Group Tax department is responsible for ensuring that the 
Deutsche Telekom Group pays taxes at the national and interna-
tional level in accordance with the applicable laws. This includes 
the Group’s income taxes, which must also be regularly reported 
in our IFRS financial statements, as well as VAT and income tax on 
salaries payable within the context of customer transactions and 
for Group employees and other taxes that are triggered for the 
Group.
Group Tax also ensures that the Group has an efficient tax struc-
ture within the framework of German and foreign tax laws as appli-
cable in each country (avoidance of any unnecessary tax burden 
not prescribed by law). The goal is to achieve sustainable tax effi-
ciency for the Group. In the view of Group Tax, transparent, trust-
based cooperation with local tax authorities – for example, in con-
nection with operationally advisable company reorganizations – 
plays an essential role in any efforts toward that goal.
In addition, Group Tax undertakes to contribute as much as possi-
ble to the success of Deutsche Telekom’s operations, e.g., by pro-
viding detailed advice regarding new business models or innova-
tive technological developments. In such matters, it focuses par-
ticularly on directly clarifying any unresolved issues related to tax 
law, as well as on providing practical solutions to meeting all appli-
cable tax requirements.
The company’s “Tax Compliance, Sustainable Tax Efficiency, Tax as 
Valued Business Partner” tax strategy (incl. tax policy) has been 
approved by the Deutsche Telekom Board of Management.
For detailed information on the work of Group Tax, its principles, 
and its responsible approach to taxation, please refer to the 
detailed document “tax strategy”.
Further information with regard to taxation of Deutsche Telekom
Additional information with regard to our taxes – for example, 
about our country-based reporting, and additional details about 
tax rates – is provided in the documents on Country-by-Country 
Reporting and the Cash Tax Rate Reconciliation.
In addition, Deutsche Telekom participates in initiatives aimed at 
developing a comprehensive approach to determining and pub-
lishing meaningful information about tax payments by enterprises 
and enterprise groups. The aim is to give a full and differentiated 
view of the various contributions to the financing of the public 
domain that are made in connection with or otherwise result from 
enterprises and entrepreneurial activities. In this context, for some 
years now, Deutsche Telekom has determined “Total Tax Contribu-
tion” figures for our key national companies in the telecommunica-
tions sector. This approach is explained in greater detail in the  
document on Total Tax Contribution, which also contains the 
respective information relating to our Group. Deutsche Telekom 
also intends to collect and publish such information in the coming 
years, and to potentially extend its scope to additional national 
companies.
Tax strategy – Tax Compliance, Sustainable Tax Efficiency, 
Tax as Valued Business Partner
The Group Tax department is responsible for ensuring that the 
Deutsche Telekom Group pays taxes at the local, national and 
international level in accordance with the applicable laws. This 
includes the Group’s income taxes, which must also be regularly 
reported in our IFRS financial statements, as well as indirect taxes 
(e.g., VAT, sales/use, telecom) and income tax on salaries payable 
within the context of customer transactions and for Group employ-
ees.
Group Tax also ensures that the Group has an efficient tax struc-
ture within the framework of German and foreign tax laws as appli-
cable in each country (avoidance of any unnecessary tax burden 
not prescribed by law). The goal is to achieve sustainable tax effi-
ciency for the Group, for which Group Tax regards transparent, 
trust-based cooperation with local tax authorities as essential, e.g., 
in the context of company reorganizations that are advisable in 
business terms.
In addition, Group Tax undertakes to contribute as much as possi-
ble to the success of Deutsche Telekom’s operations, e.g., by pro-
viding detailed advice regarding new business models or innova-
tive technological developments. In such matters, it focuses par-
ticularly on clarifying upfront any unresolved tax law-related issues 
as well as providing practical solutions to meeting all applicable 
tax requirements.
Organisation of the Deutsche Telekom tax function
The three pillars of the Tax Strategy – Tax Compliance, Sustainable 
Tax Efficiency, Tax as Valued Business Partner – were approved by 
the management board of Deutsche Telekom and are consistent 
with the approaches to tax management applied by the tax 
departments of non-German group companies.
On a regular basis, the management board of Deutsche Telekom 
inter alia addresses tax implications and topics when dealing with 
various board presentations. Important separate tax topics are 
presented to the management board of Deutsche Telekom by the 
director of Group Tax and the CFO of Deutsche Telekom.
Group Tax and the director of Group Tax (Senior Vice President Tax) 
directly report to the CFO of Deutsche Telekom. Like for example 
Treasury, Accounting and Legal, Group Tax is part of the Deutsche 
Telekom Group’s central functions and located within the Group’s 
parent company Deutsche Telekom AG. The director of Group Tax 
reports on specific issues on a case-by-case basis, for example per 
e-mail, as well as monthly in a personal exchange directly with the 
CFO of Deutsche Telekom and also participates in regular weekly 
meetings of the finance function steering committee (Senior Lead-
ership Team Finance), in the course of which aspects of Group 
taxes are addressed.

The director Group Tax is also a member of the executive leader-
ship circles of the top 250 and the top 50 business leaders of the 
Deutsche Telekom Group, which meet for example annually at 
exchange meetings over the course of several days, in particular 
also to ensure a best possible information flow and networking 
between the business leaders as well as the headquarters’ central 
functions of Deutsche Telekom Group.
Group Tax is organized in several sub-departments, which are 
managed by a respective leadership function directly reporting to 
the head of Group Tax. In addition to the departments for wage 
taxes and exercise taxes there are departments for profit taxes’ 
reporting including tax compliance (filing of tax declarations and 
support of tax audits img) as well as for the tax advice and support 
of reorganizations and M&A transactions.
In the course of the establishment of a Tax Compliance Manage-
ment System (Tax CMS) Group Tax has comprehensively defined 
and documented its responsibilities and processes as well as its 
approaches, guidelines and principles. Regular updates and con-
trols are implemented. The Tax Compliance Management System 
was presented to the Deutsche Telekom management board. In 
addition, a Tax Risk Management Report is regularly set up, which 
identifies, evaluates and documents tax risks as well as suggests 
measures for risk mitigation.
In addition to Group Tax, various group companies have also their 
own, sometimes very large tax departments, which ensure the tax 
compliance in the individual countries and constitute the local 
points of contact for the respective local tax administrations. This 
applies in particular with respect to larger “natcos” of Deutsche 
Telekom Group, some of which are themselves publicly listed stock 
corporations with outside shareholders. Group Tax works trust-
based with all such local tax departments, for example through 
calls dealing with specific issues, through monthly alignment calls 
and working visits at the respective company and annual or bi-
yearly meetings of the tax function of Deutsche Telekom Group as 
a whole over the course of several days. Some of such local tax 
departments have – in addition to the groupwide aligned three 
pillar tax strategy - their own further guidelines, which are aligned 
with local requirements.
Establishment of a detailed Tax Strategy, respective resolution 
and updates
The present detailed Tax Strategy was set up by Group Tax and 
presented to the CFO of Deutsche Telekom as well as resolved 
upon by the CFO and also the management board of Deutsche 
Telekom as a whole. The CFO resolves on respective updates, 
last on28 January 2022. A need for revision is determined upon 
specific occasions as well as regularly. Major changes of the Tax 
Strategy would be resolved upon by the management board of 
Deutsche Telekom as a whole.
Our Group Tax’ working principles
In line with our tax policy guidelines, compliance with all applica-
ble tax laws and regulations is the top priority for Group Tax. In this, 
we consider not only the letter of the law, but also its spirit, reason, 
and purpose, as well as its wider context.
Compliance with all applicable tax laws and regulations concern-
ing all Group activities is a compulsory requirement for Deutsche 
Telekom Group as a whole. The respective first pillar of the Tax 
Strategy of Deutsche Telekom is of the utmost importance, 
addressed by the management board of Deutsche Telkom as a 
whole (“Tax Compliance – Complying with all Tax Requirements 
No Matter What (‘Correct Tax Numbers Always and Everywhere’)”, 
it applies to all group companies of Deutsche Telekom, i.e. such 
German and non-German group companies that are indirectly or 
directly majority-owned by Deutsche Telekom AG.
The Group Tax approach is as follows:
	
Determination of the relevant facts, the business, economic, 
financial, legal and other motivations and aspects
	
Development of viable, practical, and robust solutions in  
cooperation with the other parties involved
	
Formulation of sound tax analysis
	
Documentation of the facts and the tax positions taken includ-
ing the respective analysis
	
Use of efficient processes to correctly comply with tax  
declaration obligations
	
Engagement in a close, trust-based working relationship with 
the tax authorities
	
If necessary, assertion of the own tax opinion with the finance 
courts
A great deal of emphasis is placed on the professional and per-
sonal qualifications of employees. Many Group Tax employees are 
qualified as tax advisors and/or lawyers, as well as having addi-
tional relevant qualifications such as studies abroad or other aca-
demic titles; the majority of them have a degree in business stud-
ies or law. The regular training of employees is ensured by means 
of internal and external, regular and ad hoc seminars, meetings, 
conferences, and through other forms of knowledge sharing. 
Employees are involved in a wide range of relevant working groups 
and committees of industry associations to ensure that the latest 
topics and developments are addressed. Appropriate specializa-
tion and coverage of special issues ensure the necessary specialist 
knowledge. Development measures not addressing the expert 
qualifications, in particular regarding team building, include for 
example keynotes and workshops with respect to inter alia energy 
management, attitude, leadership as well as working environment, 
collaboration and communication.
To the extent necessary or appropriate, Group Tax makes use of the 
external tax expertise of legal and tax advisors worldwide. Budget 
restrictions practically do not exist in this respect in view of the 
financial relevance respectively the importance of compliance.

Nevertheless, the efficient application of resources is of course a 
major focus of Group Tax as well.
In the context of digitalization, special IT tools are increasingly 
being created for and by Group Tax to support the efficient docu-
mentation of tax-relevant facts and compliance with tax obliga-
tions as well as to create the best possible working environment 
for the tax authorities for tax audits. In addition to the so-called 
VAT Validation Tool, which already for many years is successfully 
ensuring the VAT compliance in the German part of the Group, this 
concerns in particular the TEO - tax everything online IT-solution, 
developed by Group Tax in collaboration with an IT consultancy 
firm specialising in tax IT-development and used within Deutsche 
Telekom Group as well as by several further groups of companies 
on a licence basis (“TEO User-Group”), which also furthers the pro-
fessional exchange. In addition to the Group’s tax reporting, TEO 
massively supports the project regarding the carrying out of a 
timely tax audit (“zeitnahe Betriebsprüfung”) agreed upon 
between Deutsche Telekom in Germany and the German tax 
administration, aiming at a tax audit and a final assessment 
regarding a relevant tax year already in the subsequent year.
The project of the timely tax audit enables a significant reduction 
of tax risks within the German part of Deutsche Telekom Group 
through leaving only one or two “open” tax years, which are still 
subject to tax audit (filing of all tax declarations as a rule in the first 
half of the subsequent year, commencement of the tax audit in the 
second half of such subsequent year, conclusion of the tax audit 
through the final audit meeting and issuance of the final tax 
assessments three to four quarters subsequently).
Accurately analysing the tax situation and providing support to 
ensure the tax efficiency of issues and projects requires a precise 
and profound knowledge of the business, economic, and financial 
issues as well as their legal and other aspects and relevant general 
conditions. We therefore also focus on ensuring a general close-
ness to the business units and to other relevant departments in the 
Group. To this end, special opportunities have been created in the 
Group Tax department in particular for short secondments and 
other opportunities for exchange (for example so-called “Tax Days 
Off” which are spent in another part of the Group), in addition to 
the other usual sources of networking and information.
Group Tax is involved in the decision-making process for all of the 
Group’s significant measures. In this context, the relevant facts are 
comprehensively determined and considered for the tax analysis. 
In the event of multiple suitable alternatives to achieve the same 
purpose, Group Tax will recommend the most tax-efficient option. 
Of course, tax aspects are not usually the deciding factor, rather 
the process weighs up all relevant aspects. To prepare for deci-
sions, Group Tax works efficiently with all other departments 
involved.
Tax analyses are carried out, for example, with respect to:
	
the development of new and amendment of existing business, 
production, and sales models, the development of new  
markets 
	
the acquisition and disposal of shares, business operations, 
entities, and groups of companies 
	
corporate restructurings and other restructuring measures, as 
well as changes in the relevant internal processes 
	
financings 
	
other relevant projects and transactions
Our responsible approach to tax
It is the aim of Group Tax to facilitate the business and value crea-
tion in the Group as much as possible, not to hinder it, and to make 
a constructive contribution to the formulation of solutions and 
approaches that are as robust and practicable as possible from a 
tax perspective through a deep knowledge of the Group’s business 
activities and processes. Group Tax is committed to creating value 
for the shareholders of Deutsche Telekom by means of sustainable 
tax efficiency and by contributing to the joint success of the 
Group. As such, the decisions and approaches taken by Group Tax 
also take into account the consequences for business activities 
and the Group’s internal processes as well as any other implica-
tions, for example, for the reputation, profile, or policies of the 
Group.
Group Tax endeavours to minimize disputes with the tax authori-
ties, and to limit such disputes to instances where its positions are 
supported by the law.
We seek to rule out or minimize in advance tax risks wherever pos-
sible and reasonable on a case-by-case basis by obtaining binding 
statements from the competent tax authorities. Also due to the 
already-mentioned project regarding the timely tax audit with the 
German tax administration, potential tax risks regarding the Ger-
man part of the Group are in any case as a rule limited to one to 
two open tax years (so-called “all in one year” tax audit process).
Group Tax addresses its collective responsibility for society as a 
whole also by supporting the law-making activity of the tax legisla-
tor. In particular, the intention is to point to practical taxation con-
sequences for businesses as well as to avoid systemic contradic-
tions in values within the state fiscal framework, in both cases 
based on the practical experience and expert knowledge of Group 
Tax and as a rule channelled through business associations, but 
also through scientific work.
Approach to transfer prices, publication of tax information and 
transparency as well as to tax structures and tax risks
Transfer pricing
For transfer pricing matters, the Deutsche Telekom Group has a 
Transfer Pricing Guideline, which applies the current arm’s length 
principle. The Transfer Pricing Guideline is implemented on a 
groupwide basis and binding. It provides the employees of 
Deutsche Telekom with information regarding the tax require-
ments with respect to the setting of prices for intra-group supplies 
and gives respective instructions. We ensure through appropriate 
processes that the arm’s length principle is taken into account 
when agreeing the terms and conditions of intragroup relation-
ships. In this respect the implementation of the Transfer Pricing

Guideline is secured by transfer pricing experts of Group Tax 
through the carrying out of expert communication exchanges with 
and the monitoring of business units.
Publication of tax information and transparency
Deutsche Telekom implements comprehensive transparency, in 
particular towards the local tax administrations, but also towards 
the public.
The Deutsche Telekom Group is implementing the reporting obli-
gations arising in connection with the BEPS developments, includ-
ing country-by-country reporting. A project team was set up early 
on and a specific IT tool developed for this purpose. The respective 
information and documents are sent to the competent tax authori-
ties on time.
Our published annual reports as well as further publications and 
statements that are accessible to the general public contain exten-
sive data and other information regarding the tax framework and 
the tax circumstances of the Group, also with respect to our seg-
ments, and in this context also relevant country-related informa-
tion concerning some jurisdictions of particular relevance, includ-
ing respective derivations and explanations; in order to avoid repe-
tition here we would like to make full reference thereto.
In addition, various of our group companies are themselves organ-
ised as stock corporations, the shares of which are as such also 
publicly traded at a number of stock exchanges and which have 
outside shareholders not within Deutsche Telekom Group respec-
tively free float. Therefore, such group companies comply them-
selves also with comprehensive reporting requirements regarding 
tax according to the regulations applicable to them, including inter 
alia any capital markets regulations. Reference is made to such 
specific further publications.
In addition, Deutsche Telekom publishes further information with 
respect to taxes at Deutsche Telekom, for example country-by-
country reporting and additional explanations regarding tax rates, 
which can be accessed via the chapter on taxes of the CR report. 
This annually includes the so-called Total Tax Contribution of the 
major telecommunication companies of the Deutsche Telekom 
Group, which information has been assembled by Deutsche Tele-
kom for several years now in order to determine and make visible 
the contributions of the respective entrepreneurial activities to 
public financing and finances. The determination of the Total Tax 
Contribution shall be continued also in future years, potentially 
with a further extended scope.
In the course of the project of the timely tax audit the German tax 
administration furthermore receives comprehensive information 
packages in agreed format in advance, and therefore a particularly 
high degree of early transparency is achieved prior to and in the 
course of the timely tax audit. This also supports the alignment 
with the tax authorities, in particular the local tax audit, regarding 
present respectively future sets of facts with the aim to achieve 
further increased efficiency, specifically regarding the subsequent 
tax audit.
Approach to tax structures and tax risks
Due to the high importance of local telecommunication infrastruc-
ture as well as local permits for the carrying out of respective 
activities our core business is from the outset specifically local and 
as a rule also addressed by relevant tax laws and regulations. 
Therefore, the locally generated added value is as a rule also 
locally taxed. Deutsche Telekom Group has less of an international 
business model, but rather a multi-national one: The customers 
are served locally by local group companies with local infrastruc-
ture.
In accordance with our profile as an international telecommunica-
tions group, we have business activities in a large number of coun-
tries. Generally, we conduct local business activities through sub-
sidiaries in the respective country. As an international group, 
Deutsche Telekom aims to set our activities on an international 
footing and not to concentrate them entirely in Germany, so as to 
further good international cooperation and partnerships within the 
Group.
For example, in the Netherlands, which are, respectively were, a 
key location for the Deutsche Telekom Group, we conduct, respec-
tively conducted, substantial business activities through a number 
of subsidiaries. Among other things, T-Systems has a presence 
there, as in many other countries, through a Dutch subsidiary, 
which is responsible for local activities. For many years we were 
extensively involved in mobile communications there, through the 
subsidiary T-Mobile Netherlands, which had additionally taken over 
the activities of the Dutch Orange and Tele2 group. Due to the 
Netherlands being a market-standard jurisdiction for this, we 
already established a Group financing company as well as our 
international holding company there very many years ago.
From a tax perspective, inappropriate profit transfers are pre-
vented from the outset by applying the arm’s length principle. Fur-
thermore, the shift of the taxable basis out of Germany is impossi-
ble due to the applicability of the tax provisions regarding the Ger-
man controlled foreign company rules and other rules and 
regulations.
There is no artificial shifting of created value to low-tax countries.
We do not have any artificial special purpose entities without eco-
nomic substance in low-tax countries.
There is no use of jurisdictions without transparency or of so-called 
"tax havens" for tax avoidance.
We do not operate any aggressive tax structures without eco-
nomic substance exclusively for tax avoidance.
Group Tax engages in robust tax planning based on a comprehen-
sive analysis of the tax laws and regulations. Substantial risks due 
to tax uncertainties regarding the application of the law are, to the 
extent possible and sensible, addressed through binding rulings or 
similar pre-alignments with the tax administration. Due to the 
timely tax audit regarding the German part of the Group, tax risks 
in that jurisdiction are as a rule limited to only a few open tax

years. In addition, a Tax Risk Management Report is regularly setup 
in order to identify, evaluate and document tax risks as well as to 
point to steps for risk mitigation.
In accordance with the obligation to generate value for the 
Deutsche Telekom Group and its shareholders, Group Tax is also 
subject to efficient cost control.
Tax governance and control framework, risk management
Proper implementation of the detailed Tax Strategy is ensured by 
Group Tax. Responsible is the head of Group Tax who directly 
reports to the CFO of Deutsche Telekom.
Tax participates in the general governance and control framework 
as well as in the general risk management of Deutsche Telekom. 
This applies with respect to regular requests regarding risk report-
ing, regular risk documentation and evaluation, regular updates of 
important tax parameters, regular internal controls, regular internal 
revision audits, regular and comprehensive audit activities of 
external auditors, regular succession planning processes etc. The 
tax procedures, respective controls and the risk management are 
therefore comprehensively integrated into the respective infra-
structure of Deutsche Telekom, to which reference is hereby made. 
This applies also with respect to the AskMe- and TellMe-portals of 
Deutsche Telekom, the centralized points of contact of the Group 
for any questions regarding compliance and for any, also anony-
mous, reporting of (potential) compliance issues (so-called 
whistleblowing).
Group Tax is in constant and close exchange with all relevant busi-
ness units and departments of the Group in order to ensure the 
correct tax evaluation of the activities and to monitor the compli-
ance with tax rules and regulations. In this respect, a multitude of 
regular meetings and alignment processes is established. Group 
Tax also conducts on a case-by-case basis specific trainings and 
workshops regarding relevant tax topics within and outside Group 
Tax. Group tax moreover publishes relevant tax information in the 
intranet. Consecutive tax knowhow trainings within Group Tax shall 
result in the identification by all members of Group Tax of risks, 
chances and respective topics for further analysis, which are 
recorded in respective documentations. Processes to be carried 
out in regular intervals within Group Tax result in the recording of 
and dealing with potential tax risks, this through the application of 
IT-solutions specifically developed for such purpose.
In addition, within the framework of its Tax Compliance Manage-
ment System Group Tax comprehensively revises and controls its 
procedures and potential risks. This includes a description of all 
processes with responsibilities, risk assessments and measures for 
risk mitigation etc. Furthermore, regularly a Tax Risk Management 
Report is compiled, which identifies, evaluates and documents tax 
risks as well as addresses measures for risk mitigation.
Group Tax is furthermore represented in numerous associations 
and organizations addressing tax questions and therefore thus 
receives up-to-date information on relevant tax topics and partici-
pates in respective exchanges. A focus is laid on initiatives regard-
ing the advancing digitalization of tax and tax-relevant processes 
with the aim of further enhancing the respective procedures.
Inclusion of stakeholders and management of stakeholders’ tax 
concerns
Deutsche Telekom has established general processes regarding 
enquiries by stakeholders, in particular by shareholders respec-
tively investors, as well as all other interested parties and the pub-
lic. This includes enquiries relating to tax. Through such channels, 
all enquiries with a tax aspect reach Group Tax and are dealt with 
by Group Tax within a short period of time.
Group Tax attaches the utmost importance to a trust-based, trans-
parent cooperation of integrity with the competent tax authorities. 
Within the framework of the project regarding the timely audit the 
German tax authorities receive agreed information packages in 
advance using specifically developed IT tools for such purpose, 
which enable the tax authorities to carry out comprehensive audit 
activities. In the course of numerous regular as well as specific 
meetings and workshops a close exchange regarding a great num-
ber of issues and relevant questions takes place. Audit findings are 
dealt with by Group Tax within a short period of time.
In addition, Group Tax participates extensively in tax expert discus-
sions within the framework of a number of industry organizations 
and tax working groups of various institutions. Members of Group 
Tax contribute as speakers or panelists to expert seminars and 
conferences and thereby receive also extensive up-to-date infor-
mation regarding relevant topics. Furthermore, direct exchanges 
on relevant tax issues, with a focus on practicability, take place 
with tax authorities, including representatives of the highest tax 
administration bodies. These exchanges concern on the one hand 
potential consequences of possible tax law changes, the practica-
bility and the consistency with the tax legislator’s aims and pur-
poses, on the other hand tax expert contributions regarding the 
development of tax laws on the international level and respective 
practical consequences. One focus of Group Tax is to find possibili-
ties of a further digitalization of tax-relevant processes; in this 
respect Group Tax is involved with respective institutions.
Group Tax is award-winning
Group Tax won the renowned Juve Award for Best Inhouse Tax 
Team 2016 for its special efforts with regard to its good working 
relationship with the tax authorities and its efficient digitalization 
of tax processes, as well as its participation in the special project 
for a timely tax audit.
Social commitment: Pro-bono consulting
Deutsche Telekom welcomes and promotes the social engage-
ment of its employees. As such, it expressly supports Group Tax 
staff who want to contribute their expertise in the form of pro-
bono consultations for charitable purposes. The Corporate 
Responsibility unit provides them with help, where necessary, in 
finding suitable opportunities for such work. A framework policy 
from 2012 governs the exact approach for this kind of pro-bono 
work – e.g., the drafting of articles of association that satisfy pub-
lic benefit criteria for tax purposes – by individual Group Tax 
employees.

Research and development
As a future-oriented telecommunications business, we support 
and participate in ongoing research.
	
We collaborate, for instance, with various universities, with a 
view to supporting current research activities and promoting 
digital literacy. Here the focus is on the issues of innovation,  
talent acquisition, and training. In 2023, the Magenta Campus 
Team set out to build a network for all employees that are 
active in universities and who want to address young talent. 
The network is designed to promote ongoing knowledge shar-
ing between the academic community – i.e., students, aca-
demic staff, and professors – and Deutsche Telekom’s innova-
tion and technology units so they can learn from each other. 
We also aim to attract graduates as future Deutsche Telekom 
employees.
	
We are also involved in an internal research project known as 
Green NFT (non-fungible token). Using a blockchain system, we 
are investigating to what extent Deutsche Telekom’s upstream 
and downstream CO₂ emissions (Scope 3) can be measured 
reliably and tracked transparently across the suppliers’ value 
chain. As part of a pilot test in 2023 with one of our suppliers, 
this supplier manually entered into the system the emissions 
figures from their business activities. After a plausibility check 
of the data, they then received in return an NFT that contains 
an actual recording of all emissions figures – a sort of digital 
certificate. This method might allow us to trace emissions 
more effectively. In this pilot test the emissions are no longer 
recorded at company level, but assigned to the specific prod-
uct orders. This way we might receive more accurate data in 
the future. Another advantage of the Green NFT approach 
would be the prompt provisioning of emissions data, which we 
can receive the moment an order is issued – currently data is 
provided with up to a year’s delay.
	
More and more people are resorting to online video streaming 
services which, among other things, consume large amounts of 
energy. Deutsche Telekom is a partner of the “Green Stream-
ing” project funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic 
Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK). In May 2023 the company 
started looking into how this increasing media usage can be 
made more energy-efficient and more sustainable. As part of 
the project, we are analyzing all components along the stream-
ing process chain in respect of their energy efficiency. Using 
machine learning, a digital twin of the process chain is being 
developed. It helps define the optimum system parameters for 
more energy-efficient operation and environmentally friendlier 
use of streaming content. The relevance of the research project 
was confirmed in October 2023 with the Green Tech Innovation 
Award.
We invested a total of EUR 25 million in research and development 
in the Group in 2023.
For the third year in a row, Telekom Deutschland and T-Mobile US 
teamed up to run the T-Challenge in November 2022 – a competi-
tion aimed at start-ups, researchers, creatives, and developers. 
The focus was on the search for technologies for a human-cen-
tered internet (“Web3 In Telecommunication – Creating a Human-
centered Internet”). The participants’ remit is to develop innovative 
ideas, including in the areas of sustainability as well as network 
and infrastructure. Here they are supported by enterprises that 
help them turn their ideas into reality. In May 2023, the best 20 
teams selected from 282 submissions from 53 countries were 
invited to the prize-giving ceremony. Six selected projects 
received prize money of EUR 600 000 in total, along with the 
opportunity to have the solutions put on the market in Europe and 
the United States by Telekom Deutschland and T-Mobile US. The 
winners included the company Twinu that aims to drive forward 
the circular economy for cell phones with a block chain-based 
solution. We are currently preparing the fourth T-Challenge on the 
topic of “AI in Telecommunications.” Applications were accepted 
from November 2023 through January 2024.
We also promote young, innovative business ideas in our technol-
ogy incubator hubraum and allow start-ups to benefit from our 
experience, and provide financial assistance and access to exclu-
sive technologies. We bring young participating companies 
together with relevant business units within the Group, for the pur-
pose of testing innovative technologies and new business models 
and bringing them to the market. In 2023, hubraum collaborated 
with about 50 start-ups.
Startupnight is one of the largest annual events in Europe at which 
start-ups can network and present their ideas and business mod-
els to companies, investors, and potential customers. As an initia-
tive of Deutsche Telekom, it is promoted primarily by our technol-
ogy incubator. hubraum also offers a periodic event series: In the 
“meetups”, we meet every month with industry experts, start-ups, 
and investors to talk about an innovative, technology-related topic. 
In the framework of our TechBoost program, we support start-ups 
(especially in connection with financing issues), offer expert 
knowledge, and provide access to our technical resources and 
customers. Click here to find out more about current hubraum

Our approach to sustainable procurement
Our Group-wide procurement strategy and derived implementa-
tion guidelines take full account of the issue of sustainability. 
These guidelines affect the entire procurement process. The strat-
egy is put into action using internal and external performance indi-
cators and management tools.

The responsibility for ensuring sustainability in procurement 
lies with the Finance Board department and the Group’s pur-
chasing functions. Other departments and Corporate Respon-
sibility provide support on specific topics.

The issue of sustainability is taken into account throughout the 
procurement process. Right from the onboarding process, sup-
pliers must always adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct. 
This includes our ambitious CR targets and requirements.

As part of tenders, we also generally apply a 20 percent 
weighting to our suppliers’ environmental objectives, their car-
bon footprint and, in the case of individual product groups, 
other social sustainability criteria. Particular importance is 
attached to the carbon footprint of our suppliers and their 
commitment to achieving ambitious climate targets; after all, 
the reduction of CO₂ emissions in our supply chain (Scope 3) 
plays a key role in achieving our goal of being climate-neutral 
(net zero) by no later than 2040 along the entire value chain.

In close collaboration with the telecommunications company 
Orange we have developed, as part of our joint venture “BuyIn”, 
a set of common, product-specific criteria for IT and network/
hardware products as well as for passive products such as 
fiber-optic cables. Since the year under review, we have 
applied these criteria to tenders over EUR 10 million for IT/NT 
hardware products and fiber-optic cables/hardware products.

We monitor potential sustainability transgressions by our sup-
pliers through third-party providers. In the event of a relevant 
violation of our requirements, we initiate a corresponding risk 
process in accordance with the Supply Chain Due Diligence 
Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG). The informa-
tion is also used in the recurring risk analysis which we conduct 
with the involvement of the relevant Group units.

Our employees have received various sustainability information 
and training courses relating to the requirements of the Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act; in addition, our Global Procurement 
Policy provides an overview of which CR criteria must be con-
sidered at which point in the procurement process.

We ensure business partners and suppliers are up to the mark 
by offering workshops on specific topics.
Corruption and bribery may cause long-term economic losses, 
prevent fair competition and needs-based investment, destroy 
jobs, and accentuate poverty and inequality in the population. As 
part of the impact analysis of our materiality assessment process, 
we have also analyzed in detail our suppliers’ sustainability perfor-
mance. We identified a moderate risk here for the issues of corrup-
tion and bribery. We are therefore committed to promoting, 
among other things, the responsible procurement of minerals and 
do our utmost to substitute conflict materials. We also offer our 
suppliers e-learning courses on compliance.
Supplier Code of Conduct
Our Supplier Code of Conduct forms part of our General Terms and 
Conditions for Purchasing and must therefore be accepted by our 
suppliers. In line with our own Group Policies, ethical, social, and 
ecological principles as well as fundamental human rights are 
enshrined in the Code of Conduct:

Code of Conduct

Code of Human Rights
With our Supplier Code of Conduct, we have furthermore made a 
commitment to complying with the internationally recognized 
norms and standards such as the ones set forth by the Interna-
tional Labour Organization (ILO) and the Organisation for Eco-
nomic Co-operation and Development, the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, and the UN Global Compact:

Furthermore, it also includes requirements relating to additional 
relevant issues such as data protection, corruption, and artificial 
intelligence. For our strategically important and particularly risk-
prone suppliers, we have on-site audits conducted regularly by 
external auditors to verify compliance with the Supplier Code of 
Conduct. As of 2022, our Supplier Code of Conduct also meets the 
requirements set out in the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in 
Supply Chains (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG).
Global Procurement Policy
Our sustainability principles for procurement are set out in the 
Group’s Global Procurement Policy.
Procurement guidelines
The Procurement guidelines provide specific instructions for 
procurement in Germany and serve as recommendations for our 
national companies.
Other policies
The Group Policy on Avoiding Corruption, the Statement on 
Extractives, and the list of prohibited materials are binding for 
our suppliers, too.
Implementation in the company
Our strategic decision to integrate sustainability into procurement 
is derived from our CR strategy and is anchored in the procure-
ment processes used throughout our Group. The responsibility for 
ensuring sustainability in procurement lies with the Finance Board 
department and the Group’s purchasing functions. Other depart-
ments and Corporate Responsibility provide support on specific 
topics.

Supplier compliance
With our Supplier Code of Conduct, we place our suppliers under 
an obligation to uphold the principles and values anchored in our 
Code of Conduct and in the Code of Human Rights. As of 2020, 
suppliers of solutions involving artificial intelligence (AI) must also 
comply with the requirements of our AI guidelines. Deutsche 
Telekom suppliers are also under the obligation to do everything 
necessary to prevent active and passive forms of corruption. We 
expect our suppliers to impose the same requirements on their 
subcontractors too.
The Supplier Code of Conduct forms part of our General Terms 
and Conditions for Purchasing, but does not, of course, supersede 
the laws and regulations of countries in which our suppliers oper-
ate. Rather, it is designed to facilitate compliance with these laws 
and regulations and ensure that legal requirements are imple-
mented faithfully and effectively. Since 2014, we have offered 
online compliance training for our suppliers.
When selecting business partners, we conduct integrity checks. In 
addition to suppliers, and development and joint venture partners, 
this applies in particular to certain groups of consultants whose 
use may be associated with compliance risks.
ESG KPI “Procurement Volume Without CR Risk” 
The ESG KPI “Procurement Volume without CR Risk” – for which 
the target is 95 percent by 2025 – measures the procurement vol-
ume from direct business partners for whom, in the period under 
review, checks by an established external service provider turned 
up no negative media reports. It also includes suppliers for whom 
such reports were identified and who took suitable action to cor-
rect the issues involved. The procurement volume so assessed for 
risks accounted for a 99.98 percent share of the total relevant vol-
ume in 2023 (previous year: 99.6 percent). This ESG KPI, along 
with the ESG KPI “Procurement Volume Verified as Non-Critical”, is 
calculated with respect to the reviewed Group-wide procurement 
volume shown in the Group’s standardized procurement-report 
system (not including the category “Network Capacity” and not 
including T Mobile US).

Supply chain management
To be able to enter into a business relationship with us, strategic 
suppliers have to register on our supplier portal and undergo a 
qualification process. The data provided gives us comprehensive 
information on our suppliers, including on their CO₂ sustainability 
goals. Suppliers themselves also receive detailed information via 
the mandatory Supplier Code of Conduct on Deutsche Telekom’s 
fundamental principles and values - also regarding corporate 
responsibility and sustainability. In the year under review, we 
updated the Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) to allow us to meet 
the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act 
more effectively. In another effort in this context, we require our 
suppliers to guarantee compliance with the SCoC along their 
entire supply chain. As part of our adapting to new circumstances, 
we have also adopted the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights and also stipulated that our suppliers must provide 
complaint management.
When selecting suppliers, our procurement organization focuses 
on ensuring that we cooperate with efficient, reliable suppliers 
that work with sustainability in mind. This will allow us to safe-
guard our capacity to innovate and competitiveness over the long 
term. When selecting suppliers, we include sustainability criteria in 
the decision. CO₂ emissions are generally weighted with 20 per-
cent as part of tenders.
As part of supplier management, there are various processes that 
aim to minimize the risks in the supply chain and to increase its 
sustainable further development. We set out our minimum 
requirements for our suppliers in the SCoC to ensure compliance 
with the requirements along the value chain. With strategic pro-
curement processes, suppliers are registered on our supplier por-
tal. The supplier qualification then begins where suppliers are vet-
ted in relation to various criteria.
We also use the following Group-wide ESG KPIs as additional 
monitoring and control tools:

ESG KPI “Procurement Volume without CR Risk”

ESG KPI “Procurement Volume Verified as Non-Critical” 

ESG KPI “CDP Supply Chain Program”
To improve sustainability performance in our supply chain, we 
implement a specially designed development program in close 
cooperation with selected suppliers. In 2020, the program was 
transferred to the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC). We also hold regu-
lar workshops with selected suppliers on relevant sustainability 
topics. The topics covered by the workshops included emissions 
management, avoiding hazardous substances and using alterna-
tive materials in products, extending the product life span, reduc-
ing electrical scrap and launching take-back programs, as well as 
designing for greater sustainability and innovation.
We also provide our suppliers with an external training video, 
which can be accessed freely via the Deutsche Telekom website.
The main objective of our sustainable supply chain management is 
to minimize potential risks while generating long-term economic 
benefit for all parties involved.

German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act risk process
Our corporate procurement organization conducts annual risk 
analyses of direct suppliers with all companies affected by the 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. Suppliers also undergo 
ad-hoc analyses where there is well-founded knowledge of trans-
gressions. These two measures help identify and mitigate risks and 
transgressions. If a supplier cannot meet the sustainability require-
ments anchored in our Supplier Code of Conduct to our satisfac-
tion or there are specific transgressions, we ask the supplier to pro-
vide an explanation. We also look to talk to the supplier concerned 
and set out our requirements for suitable measures in these dis-
cussions.
If the discussions held on various levels and the derived measures 
do not lead to the shortcomings being remedied, the responsible 
decision-makers consult with each other to reach agreement 
about how to proceed with the supplier. In the worst case, this 
could lead to the business relationship with the supplier being 
terminated.

Everyone who identifies irregularities in our supply chain regarding 
compliance with laws, internal guidelines, and standards of con-
duct, can report these – and can do so anonymously if they wish – 
using our TellMe portal. We also receive information on possible 
irregularities via the audits as part of the cross-industry Joint 
Alliance for CSR (JAC) or the media.
Receipt of violations through recurrent risk analyses or via 
reporting channels
The corporate procurement organization conducts annual risk 
analyses for direct suppliers connected with the system. An ad hoc 
analysis is also conducted where violations are substantiated, i.e., 
considering evidence that gives credence to a potential breach of 
human rights or environmental obligations. These analyses identify 
high-risk suppliers.
We acquire substantiated knowledge through the following 
sources: the TellMe whistleblower portal, information in the media 
(including via external data providers), civil society reports, the 
Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC), or reports from employees. Identified 
transgressions against objects of protection under the Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act are then transferred to the expert com-
mittee. This committee comprises representatives from the Sus-
tainability and Compliance functions and is coordinated by the 
corporate procurement organization.
Documentation of the risk event
The person reporting the transgression uses a document created 
specifically for this purpose to prepare details of the incident for 
the members of the expert committee. The corporate procure-
ment organization coordinates the provisioning of information by 
the person reporting the transgression and presents this informa-
tion to the expert committee at regular meetings.
Determination of the risk’s relevance
The expert committee produces a recommendation or takes a 
decision regarding the relevance of risks presented by the respec-
tive violation reports. They stipulate what action to take next 
accordingly. Where necessary, decisions on preventive and  
remedial action are taken at this point.
Supplier’s statement
Depending on the decision, the expert committee commissions 
the unit to obtain a statement from the supplier using a supplied 
template. This includes a description of the incident and questions 
on mitigation measures and other aspects. The statement must be 
submitted within 14 days (or as decided earlier in the expert com-
mittee). If no response is received by then, a reminder is sent.
Derivation of measures based on the statement
The expert committee and the relevant functions discuss the sup-
plier’s statement and derive effective mitigation measures. The 
unit agrees the timetable for implementing the measures individu-
ally with the supplier and passes this information onto the expert 
committee that documents the measures. Either Deutsche 
Telekom stipulates the measures that the supplier must accept or, 
alternatively, the supplier can stipulate its own mitigation meas-
ures.
Confirmation and notification regarding successful implementa-
tion of measures
If the statement including confirmation of the mitigation measures 
proves sufficient, an implementation timetable is agreed and the 
implementation must be confirmed. The unit is responsible for fol-
lowing up on the remedial measures, including the involvement of 
the expert committee where any anomalies arise in subsequent 
months.
Insufficient measures and, where applicable, escalation to the 
LkSG Risk Board
If the statement including confirmation of the mitigation measures 
proves insufficient, the unit contacts the supplier again. If the feed-
back remains unsatisfactory, the expert committee escalates the 
case to the LkSG Risk Board.
Determination of the risk’s relevance and further action
The LkSG Risk Board produces a recommendation regarding the 
relevance of the risk presented by the transgression and the par-
ticular supplier. The unit then decides how to proceed in respect of 
the supplier, whether to continue or terminate the business rela-
tionship, for instance.
Final documentation of the incident
The unit informs all involved stakeholders about the final decision 
and the corporate procurement organization finalizes its documen-
tation of the incident.

Risk monitoring
In Procurement, we work with a comprehensive supplier risk moni-
toring scheme. We first conduct a risk assessment of all material 
groups at a predefined material group level and subject suppliers 
to comprehensive risk analysis. Specialized companies evaluate all 
suppliers with regard to financial, CR, and compliance risks.
The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act requirements have 
given rise to the following classifications of material groups for the 
year under review:
	
High-risk material groups: 32
	
Medium-risk material groups: 22
	
Low-risk material groups: 53
With selected strategic and high-risk suppliers, supplier assess-
ments are also conducted in addition to the risk analysis. For this 
purpose we use EcoVadis, the platform for ESG ratings for busi-
nesses. Where specific infringements of our sustainability require-
ments or an increased predisposition for risk are found, we also 
directly conduct audits on location. Our primary aim is to address 
deficits together with the supplier and take appropriate corrective 
action. Only if no solutions are possible do we have to cut ties with 
suppliers.
Supplier sustainability reviews (excl. T-Mobile US)
In 2023, we conducted a total of 150 supplier reviews – 137 of 
which were on-site reviews (social audits) and 13 mobile surveys. 
62 direct and 88 indirect suppliers were involved in the checks.
For the on-site reviews, we let the supplier know the approximate 
time of our visit in advance (“semi-announced audit”). This is nec-
essary to make sure that relevant contacts in key functions are pre-
sent for the audit. The mobile surveys give our suppliers’ employ-
ees the opportunity to provide anonymous information about the 
social and ecological situation at their company. The surveys are 
primarily used to gain an initial impression of the local working 
conditions in order to then initiate further measures as needed, 
such as specific on-site reviews (social audits).

Auditing procedures
We focus our audit activities on strategically important and par-
ticularly risky suppliers. They are routinely audited every two to 
three years. This group includes roughly 250 of our over 20 000 
active suppliers. Together, they cover around 80 percent of our 
procurement volume. These audits give us transparency about the 
risks in large parts of our supply chain. We also collaborate as part-
ners with selected suppliers to constantly improve their sustaina-
bility performance. Our previous Supplier Development Program, 
which we used to encourage the continued development of strate-
gically relevant suppliers in key sustainability issues such as envi-
ronmental protection, working hours regulations, and health and 
safety, was transitioned to the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) industry 
initiative in the reporting year. The program is currently being 
refined in the JAC.
We hosted the JAC Initiative General Assembly in the year under 
review where we participated in an industry dialog with other  
telecommunications companies. Issues discussed in the dialog 
included the further development of auditing requirements, 
improvements in transparency, and the effective identification of 
measures for telecommunications-specific industry risks. One out-
come of this dialog was the establishment of dedicated working 
groups, in which Deutsche Telekom AG will participate in 2024.
The majority of our audits are conducted within the scope of the 
JAC. The audits cover the following areas:
	
Labor standards
	
Social standards
	
Living standards
	
Environmental requirements
The JAC Guidelines require, among other things, that our suppli-
ers:
	
Pay a fair wage that enables employees to enjoy a decent 
standard of living;
	
Respect the right to freedom of association and collective bar-
gaining, and provide a healthy, safe working environment and
	
Do not exceed a 48-hour working week and a weekly maximum 
of twelve hours’ overtime, and grant at least one free day after 
six consecutive days of working.

participating in our program.

Compliance with all these requirements is reviewed regularly dur-

the features and quality of the working, sleeping, and cafeteria 
areas.
Deutsche Telekom does not require its suppliers to obtain external 
environmental or social certification. But if suppliers cannot show 
any environmental and social responsibility certificates, we do 
expect equivalent management systems to be used. Our auditing 
experience shows, however, that the majority of our relevant man-
ufacturing suppliers have an external certificate or equivalent 
management systems.
Verification of important social and ecological aspects as well as 
fundamental human rights during our audits is in line with interna-
tionally recognized guidelines and standards such as the ILO core 
labor standards, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enter-
prises.
Audit results
In the audit program, which has been established and is controlled 
at Group level, a total of 150 on-site audits were carried out in 
2023.
As in previous years, we concentrated our auditing activities on 
suppliers in Asia, Europe, Latin America, Oceania, and Africa.
Audited suppliers included manufacturers in the areas of IT hard-
ware, software and services as well as networks and devices.
All violations identified in the course of such audits enter into a 
correction and measures plan, and the timely implementation of 
measures is regularly monitored. In the audits carried out in the 
period under review, no serious transgressions in the areas of 
working conditions and other basic infringements of human rights 
– such as discrimination, forced labor, and child labor – were 
found. In addition, no cases of bribery or corruption, and no critical 
violations of general compliance rules, such as rules governing the 
right to intellectual property, were found.

Of the 150 suppliers we audited in 2023 (14 of which were in 
accordance with the validated audit processes of the Responsi-
ble Business Alliance), around 41 percent (62 audits) were 
direct suppliers and 59 percent (88 audits) were tier 2 and 3 
suppliers – that is, indirect suppliers.

The audits carried out in 2023 revealed a total of 890 violations 
of Deutsche Telekom’s supplier requirements. These findings 
break down as follows: 394 cases regarding occupational 
health and safety, 157 cases regarding working hours, 102 
cases regarding environmental protection, 53 cases regarding 
working conditions, 87 cases regarding wages and remunera-
tion, 58 cases regarding corporate ethics, 21 cases regarding 
freedom of association, eight cases regarding disciplinary 
measures, and 10 cases regarding discrimination. In addition, 
the violations included 120 transgressions that needed to be 
addressed on a priority basis and an additional 546 serious 
findings. A total of 365 violations were corrected in 2023, 
including several open improvement measures from previous 
years. Examples of critical violations in 2023 and improvement 
measures can be found in the table below. As in previous years, 
most violations (44 percent) were linked to occupational health 
and safety (2022: 42 percent), followed by violations linked to 
working hours at 18 percent (2022: 12 percent). At 11 percent, 
environmental violations constituted the third-biggest issue 
(2022: 19 percent).

Environment
A factory that experienced an incident involving 
pollutant emissions from a power generator failed to 
submit a control report because it had not carried out 
any controls.
The factory has identified the factors that led to the 
pollutant emissions, and it has commissioned an 
external company to check the system annually for 
emissions. In addition, a plant inspection was carried out 
to determine whether the plant has additional emission 
sources that also need to be checked annually.
complete
Business ethics
A supplier lacked procedures for assessing bribery 
risks throughout all the activities within its sphere of 
influence.
The risk and opportunity assessments for potential 
bribery cases are now reviewed every six months.
complete
A factory failed to conduct reviews of its system for 
managing compliance with proper business ethics.
The company introduced regular reviews of its system 
for business-ethics management, and it continually 
follows up on the results of such reviews.
complete
Forced labor
A supplier’s employment contracts with workers exposed 
to occupational health risks failed to address the areas of 
occupational health and safety, working conditions, and 
protection against occupational hazards.
The employment contracts were amended to include 
suitable provisions on the areas of occupational health 
and safety, working conditions, and protection against 
occupational hazards. The supplier’s procedures for 
managing occupational health and safety issues in the 
workplace were suitably revised, and extended to cover 
the areas of occupational risks and protective measures.
complete
Occupational 
health and safety
In its employee sleeping areas, a factory lacked 
illuminated emergency exit signs for its escape-route 
stairs.
Illuminated emergency exit signs for the escape-route 
stairs were installed in employee sleeping areas.
complete
In its plant area for storage and usage of corrosive 
chemicals, a supplier had installed neither an eye-
washing station nor an emergency shower.
Such equipment was installed for employees exposed to 
risks of eye and skin contact with chemicals.
complete
A factory had failed to affix safety labels on containers 
with hazardous chemicals. In addition, hazardous 
chemicals were not being stored in leakproof containers.
All hazardous chemicals were stored in leakproof 
containers, and all containers containing hazardous 
chemicals were marked with suitable safety labels.
complete
Working hours
A supplier’s factory granted its employees only 98 days 
of paid maternity leave and only 10 days of paternity 
leave. The laws of the country in which the supplier is 
located require that employees receive 178 days of 
maternity leave and 15 days of paternity leave, however.
The supplier’s provisions on leave for employees were 
suitably revised and the changes were communicated 
to the employees. In addition, the supplier developed 
a new employee handbook that covers the relevant 
country’s legal requirements.
complete
Wages & salaries
In review of a supplier’s records, and via a survey of 
its management, the supplier was found to have been 
delaying final salary payments for employees who had 
left the company, with the delays ranging from 4 to 30 
days after the employees’ employment relationships had 
ended.
A suitable system for final salary payments for 
employees who leave the company was put in place. 
The system is designed to ensure that such employees 
receive their final salary payments within three days 
after their employment relationships have ended.

CDP Supply Chain Program
Since as early as 2016, we have been disclosing our activities to 
bring on board suppliers as part of CDP’s supplier engagement 
rating. This rating assesses how well companies have been able to 
integrate the topic of climate protection into their supply chain. In 
2023, we made it onto the Climate Leader A List, as in the previous 
year. This has secured our place on the Supplier Engagement 
Leader Board. An important step in achieving this was calculating 
the supplier-specific emission intensities based on supplier 
responses to the CDP Supply Chain Program. This involved calcu-
lating the ratio between a supplier’s overall emissions (Scopes 1 
and 2 and Scope 3 for the upstream supply chain) and the suppli-
er’s overall sales.
The ESG KPI “CDP Supply Chain Program” indicates the degree to 
which our procurement volume from carbon-intensive suppliers is 
covered by the CDP Supply Chain Program. In 2023, around 51 
percent of the procurement volume was covered by the CDP Sup-
ply Chain Program.
Supplier relationships
The percentage of audited procurement volume increased slightly 
from 21.1 percent in the previous year to 22.3 percent in 2023. At 
the same time, the percentage of procurement volume covered by 
EcoVadis increased slightly to 43.6 percent.
Responsible procurement of raw materials
We require our suppliers to protect the environment and use 
resources responsibly. This requirement is enshrined both in our 
Code of Human Rights and in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which 
sets out requirements that must generally be accepted by all sup-
pliers.
In the case of relevant material/product groups, the use of hazard-
ous materials and conflict materials is checked and assessed as 
part of the supplier and product selection. In the case of critical 
suppliers in particular, we request disclosure of information about 
their activities (via EcoVadis and CDP) and we perform supplier 
audits in the form of social audits. In these audits, we check 
whether our suppliers use an environmental management system, 
including a waste management system, and review how they man-
age their energy and water consumption.
In addition, we always check whether there is a management sys-
tem in place to address the issue of conflict resources. When 
selecting suppliers and products, we review and evaluate, for 
example, the use of hazardous and conflict materials as well as 
rare-earth metals – especially in light of the OECD Due Diligence 
Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains.
In the period under review, we readjusted the requirements placed 
on our suppliers and tightened them up significantly, particularly 
in relation to environmentally responsible action, including against 
the background of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Liefer-
kettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG) that came into effect in the 
year under review. Since then, contributions to environmental pro-
tection and climate change, responsible waste management, and 
the handling of that only degrade very slowly in the environment, 
have been enshrined in our Supplier Code of Conduct along with a 
ban on manufacturing any products containing mercury.

Our approach to sustainable products and services
Our core business consists of operating and expanding our net-
works. Our networks provide the foundation for digital participa-
tion. Since 2021, 100 percent of the electricity for our networks 
throughout the Group has been obtained from renewable 
resources. Also, by providing innovative, network-based, and digi-
tal solutions, we support our customers in reducing their own CO₂ 
emissions and in contributing to climate protection.
We want to make our entire product range more and more sustain-
able. Furthermore, we take a holistic perspective on this issue, That 
is why we also factor in the aspect of a circular economy when 
developing customer offerings and devices – a product-life-cycle 
approach that extends to production, sustainable packaging, prod-
uct use, product refurbishing, and product recycling. This requires 
thoroughgoing measures along all stages of the value chain. Con-
sequently, we begin with procurement and strive to ensure that 
our suppliers comply with our ecological, social, and ethical sus-
tainability requirements.
For us, the social aspect is equally important as the environmental 
aspects of our products and services. For that reason we strive to 
provide digital participation for everyone. We believe this requires 
a triad of Access – technical access to fast networks as well as bar-
rier- and discrimination-free design, Affordability – rate plans and 
devices that factor in people’s different financial possibilities, and 
Ability – the ability and motivation to use digital media compe-
tently.
Our labels
We have developed our #GreenMagenta and #GoodMagenta 
labels as tools for informing our customers about sustainability 
benefits. The #GreenMagenta label highlights products, services, 
projects, measures, and initiatives that are especially noteworthy 
in the areas of climate action and responsible use of resources. 
#GoodMagenta is applied to projects, actions, and initiatives that 
make a positive contribution to overcoming social and societal 
challenges in the digital world. Awarding of the two labels is sub-
ject to strict rules of our own definition. In each case, the product 
or effort, etc., has to show proven sustainability benefits. For 
awards of the #GreenMagenta label, we carry out extensive 
impact assessments. In cases in which societal or ecological 
impacts emerge that are clearly adverse, the #GreenMagenta and 
#GoodMagenta labels may not be awarded, regardless of what-
ever benefits the product or effort provides. In 2023, the year 
under review, TÜV Rheinland validated the award process for the 
sustainability label, including impact measurement, and awarded a 
certificate.
In addition, we permit products to carry recognized third-party 
environmental labels when this is appropriate. For example, sev-
eral of our router and mesh devices received the TÜV Rheinland 
“Green Product” label (TÜV Rheinland is a leading international 
provider of technical services, including certification). We use the 
strict requirements of the independent labels to help us see how 
we can further improve our products.
In 2021, working in cooperation with other mobile network opera-
tors, we developed a sustainability ranking system for mobile 
phones – the Eco Rating. It enables customers to see at a glance 
which phones score well with regard to durability, reparability and 
recyclability, climate compatibility, and resources conservation. 
For more information, click here.
Packaging
We have also been making our product packaging more and more 
sustainable. Since mid-2022, and on a European-wide basis, all of 
our own new products are being sold in sustainable packaging for 
which we have developed suitable sustainability criteria. Packag-
ing for smartphones we source from our suppliers must also meet 
these criteria. We did not become aware of any violations of the 
packaging guideline by suppliers in the year under review. We ver-
ify compliance with the criteria by means of regular factory audits. 
When shipping technical equipment in Germany, we reduce pack-
age sizes with the help of special packaging machines. Increas-
ingly, we are relying, for example, on PaperFoam, a bio-based and 
biodegradable alternative to conventional packaging materials, as 
a means of protecting our products within the packaging.
All new Deutsche Telekom-branded products, such as the T Phone, 
are shipped in plastic-free packaging. Most of the paper used is 
already recycled, or comes from sustainable forestry (FSC®-
certified).
Responsible use of resources
Our efforts to use resources responsibly begin right with the earli-
est stages of production. In our Speedport Smart 4 router, for 
example, we limit the use of harmful substances (such as in elec-
tronic components) beyond the degree required by law. Further-
more, a total of 95 percent of the housing of the Speedport Smart 
4 consists of recycled plastic.
We introduced a MagentaTV Box in Hungary and North Macedonia 
in 2023 with a housing made of bio-based polycarbonate. Bio-
based polycarbonate is a more environmentally friendly plastic 
that is manufactured solely from renewable raw materials. The box 
has already acquired the #GreenMagenta label. In 2022, we began

making our SIM cards out of recycled plastic as another example. 
That change alone is saving some 63 metric tons of CO₂ per year. 
The SIM cards carry the #GreenMagenta label. At the same time, 
we are aiming to do away entirely with plastic SIM cards and use 
only eSIMs. Via various measures, including customer advising, we 
are gradually increasing use of eSIMs. This is saving additional 
resources.
At the end of products’ life cycles, we help to ensure that they are 
reused or properly recycled. In fact, we have been collecting and 
buying back used mobile devices in various countries for this pur-
pose since 2003. Since then, in Germany alone, we have helped to 
conserve resources by recycling, or providing for reuse, more than 
3.6 million used devices. In November 2022, we reorganized our 
smartphone-collection system in our shops. Now, when customers 
return an old smartphone that has little residual value, and we can-
not make them a purchase offer, they still receive a small consider-
ation for their trouble provided the device can still be switched on 
and used. This provides an incentive for phone returns. If a smart-
phone can be given a second life, anyone interested can use our 
“Handyankauf” (phone buyback) service. These devices are then 
professionally refurbished and remarketed. The buyback portfolio 
currently has over 1 700 used models in stock. Via the “ReUse 
MyMobile” portal, we sell products that are fully refurbished and 
completely free of any technical defects. Each such product 
comes with a fresh 24-month warranty. For more information take 
a look at the Germany segment and the Environment section.
To promote sustainability, we are also committed to ensuring that 
routers and media receivers are not simply disposed of after being 
replaced. With our “Rent instead of Buying” service, we conserve 
resources, reduce the volume of electronic waste, and thus avoid 
CO₂ emissions. Last year, we provided almost one million refur-
bished devices to our customers in Germany using the service.
Affordable 5G access and promoting digital participation: 
T Phone and T Tablet
Affordable access to 5G technologies is a key issue at Deutsche 
Telekom within the framework of access and affordability as 
aspects of digital participation. As of 2022, we are offering our 
new T Phone and T Phone Pro 5G smartphones in a total of nine 
European countries and in the USA, with a view to enabling the 
largest possible numbers of people to profit from our 5G-network 
build-out. The phones also went on sale in Germany in January 
2023. The T Tablet has been available in Germany and eight other 
European countries plus the USA since the year under review. With 
these relatively affordable products, we aim to provide more peo-
ple with access to the digital world and, in particular, also drive 
forward digitalization in education with the T Tablet.
Digital participation for seniors
As part of our efforts to ensure that everyone can take part in digi-
tal society, regardless of their age, we offer special equipment and 
products for seniors. The resources available for facilitating seniors’ 
use of digital technologies include big keyboards, uncluttered dis-
plays, with large fonts and icons, and emergency-call buttons.
Subsidized rates
In Germany and at several national companies, we offer various 
subsidized rates, to enable customers on low incomes and people 
with disabilities to make calls at reasonable prices.
Subsidized rate plans
Telekom Deutschland offers special rate plans to promote digital 
participation among different groups in society. What’s more, Ger-
man Red Cross employees and firefighters can get special rates 
for Telekom rate plans thanks to corresponding framework agree-
ments.
Digitalization in schools
For more than 20 years now, we have been offering free broad-
band lines up to 16 Mbit/s to all general and vocational schools in 
Germany as part of the Telekom@School initiative. In 2023, more 
than 17 000 schools were making use of our offer. In the reporting 
year, over 9 000 additional schools took advantage of our subsi-
dized Telekom@School prices to upgrade to bandwidths of up to 
1 000 Mbit/s. In the year under review we funded the Telekom@
School initiative with around 10 million euros.
Since 2020, school authorities may opt for a flat rate for education, 
which provides pupils with an unlimited data allowance for educa-
tional content, for a low monthly charge. In addition, school 
authorities can provide tablets or laptops to disadvantaged stu-
dents, also with the help of funds from the Federal Government’s 
Digital Pact for Schools campaign. This gives children and young 
people the opportunity, irrespective of their family background, to 
learn how to use digital media. We consolidate our commitment to 
schools in our Group-wide Digital Education and School program. 
In the year under review, there were more than 14 000 active SIM 
cards in the Education mobile rate plan, which is earmarked exclu-
sively for state-approved school authorities and educational estab-
lishments. The services included in the rate plans are envisaged for 
own use by the customer and by the authorized users (e.g., school 
students) on a mobile device. The funding for the Education 
mobile rate plan totaled around 11 million euros in the year under 
review.
Together with Microsoft, we have been supporting schools in Ger-
many with an extensive digital education package (only available 
in German) since 2021. The package includes laptops or tablet 
PCs and special educational licenses for Microsoft 365 software. 
A team of Deutsche Telekom experts – specially certified by 
Microsoft – provides the service and helps set up the devices. 
Schools can test the package free of charge and without obliga-
tion.
As part of tenders for equipping schools, we make sure that our 
software and hardware suppliers are committed to compliance 
with sustainability aspects and can present appropriate certifica-
tions.
With our Magenta Classroom product, we accompany schools and 
school authorities on their way toward digital education. Our IT 
service supports schools from needs assessment for technical

infrastructure, installation and operations management, and even 
training courses and support – on site and remote. Working 
together with selected schools, we developed standards that 
should ensure a positive everyday classroom experience for every-
one involved – whether on a smart board or tablet PC.
The mental health of children and young people must not be 
underestimated when it comes to increasing digital participation 
in the classroom – especially when young people are increasingly 
facing mental health issues. The “FeeLee” app attempts to combat 
this trend by putting students’ mental health front and center. By 
using the app, young people should be able to understand their 
own feelings and reinforce their mental resilience in a fun way. 
They are asked several times a day about their emotional state – 
with emojis available to help them answer. “FeeLee” looks at habits 
and can provide tips on how to change or adapt these. The free, 
ad-free app from Deutsche Telekom is aimed specifically at young 
people, healthcare professionals, and educational establishments.
In 2022, we published our first Education Report which outlined 
the challenges and opportunities associated with digitalization in 
German schools. We also demonstrated what contribution 
Deutsche Telekom and its partners were making in this area. A 
revised version of the report is due to be published in early 2024. 
More information on the topic of digital participation through 
media skills is available here.
Video conferencing solutions for the home office
We offer our business customers secure solutions that enable their 
employees to work from home efficiently. Our home office config-
urator helps small and medium-sized businesses, for example, to 
develop customized solutions for staff working from home. Like-
wise, our Digital Schutzpaket Business (digital business protection 
package) keeps sensitive customer data safe.
In addition, we offer videoconferencing solutions of various estab-
lished providers, including some solutions with added, proprietary 
functions of our own that support energy-efficient work from 
home offices.
Measuring progress
We use various key performance indicators to measure our pro-
gress with sustainable products and services:

We use the ESG KPI “Sustainable Revenue Share” to 
determine the proportion of revenue generated with products 
and services that are classified as more sustainable, based 
on a risk-benefit analysis. 

With our “Ecologically sustainable products” KPI, we show 
what share of our entire product range consists of sustainable 
products.

With our ESG KPIs “Mobile Device Take-Back” and "CPE Take-
Back", we measure the impact of our circular economy con-
cepts.

We use the ESG KPI “Enablement Factor” to calculate the posi-
tive CO₂ effects generated as our products are used by cus-
tomers.

With the "Sustainable product packaging" KPI, we show what 
share of Deutsche Telekom-branded products consists of prod-
ucts with sustainable packaging.

Continued analysis of our products’ sustainability benefits 
To date, there is no industry-wide established system that provides 
sustainability information about ICT products and services. Since 
2014 at Deutsche Telekom, we have been using an in-house analy-
sis method to assess the sustainability of our products. This 
includes, for example, examining the safety of the products, 
or how well they can be recycled.
We inform our customers about how our products are contributing 
to sustainability. The results of our analyses also allow us to posi-
tion ourselves as a responsible company with respect to the com-
petition. In the year under review, our analysis included a review of 
selected products in light of EU taxonomy criteria.
Correlation with SDGs
In the year under review, we reviewed – with support from internal 
experts – the sustainability benefits of a number of our products in 
light of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The degree of 
detail depended on the revenue generated with the product under 
review. If revenues were high, we considered the impact on all 
SDGs; where revenues were limited, we only took the impact on 
the most relevant SDG into account.
Results of the analysis
In the year under review (2023), we studied 39 product groups in 
detail, analyzing both their contribution to sustainability and their 
business potential (as of the end of 2023).
Sustainable products are a key factor in competition for us. We use 
the ESG KPI “Sustainable Revenue Share” to determine the propor-
tion of sales (excluding T-Mobile US) generated with products that 
make a contribution to sustainability. Revenues for individual prod-
uct clusters are partially determined using a percentage allocation 
based on assumptions. In 2023, this share amounted to almost 43 
percent (prior year: 42 percent).

We have recorded this indicator since 2014 using our own meth-
odology, which we adapted in 2022. As previously, a product can 
only be assigned to the sustainable product portfolio provided it is 
highly likely that the product does not entail any of the seven risks 
defined in our methodology. The risk analysis covers the following 
issues: pollution involved in the manufacturing of ICT products, 
avoidable non-recyclable electronic waste, unethical working con-
ditions, the use of conflict minerals during production, social 
exclusion, radiation and its impacts on health, and information 
security. Additionally, a product must offer at least one of five sus-
tainability benefits. Reduced energy consumption, a reduction in 
CO₂ emissions, efforts to achieve a circular economy, a reduction 
in time required, and enabling social participation are taken into 
consideration for this. Cost savings are still considered as addi-
tional information. However, a cost benefit does not constitute a 
sustainability benefit in and of itself. Revenues from the rental of 
devices in the fixed network were included for the first time this 
year, making up around 1 percentage point of the total value. It is 
difficult to differentiate between data and voice revenues when 
taking mobile broadband revenues into account, which is why this 
is based on assumptions. Owing to the fact that the EU Taxonomy 
does not cover the major part of our business model at present, we 
are also reporting this KPI in parallel for the reporting year.
Smart Innovation
Deutsche Telekom pursues the approach of human-centered tech-
nology. Technology must be beneficial to people and should not 
be seen as an end in itself. The aim of responsible technology 
development is therefore not only to optimize processes and 
increase economic efficiency. It is also to sustainably improve peo-
ple’s living conditions, to better address their needs, to extend 
their freedom to act, and to protect their autonomy, all on the basis 
of ethical principles. Technology progress such as the Internet of 
Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) offers numerous oppor-
tunities in this respect and also with regard to the environmental 
challenges. We see a human-centered approach and attitude 
when designing and using technology as a key prerequisite for the 
future success of our business.
Internet of Things
The IoT combines physical objects with the virtual world, with 
smart devices and machines connected to one another and to the 
internet. They use sensors to collect information on their immedi-
ate surroundings, to analyze and link that information, and to pro-
vide the data in a network. The data provides in-depth insights into 
possible inefficiencies in processes. 
IoT technology can help cut costs, increase profit – and also 
reduce the consumption of resources such as water, energy, and 
raw materials and so prevent CO₂ and waste.
Types and application of IoT
At Deutsche Telekom we are utilizing future-oriented and widely 
available technologies to make cities viable for the future and to 
develop solutions for social challenges. For this reason we offer our 
customers various network technologies: NB-IoT, LTE-M, and 
4G/5G. Depending on the IoT project and use case, customers 
can choose the right technology and, in turn, also optimize energy 
consumption (see below for details of network technologies and 
usage examples).
NB-IoT and LTE-M are available in all towns and cities in Germany. 
Deutsche Telekom now offers NB-IoT in 32 countries. LTE-M, which 
was rolled out in Germany in 2020, is now available in 24 coun-
tries. The 5G wireless standard was available through the end of 
2023 in over 95.9 percent of the population in Germany; in Europe 
the same figure was 67.2 percent. Find out more about our IoT 
network here.

The following subsection presents a few smart innovations and 
usage examples of the four wireless standards. The associated 
business models make an environmental and/or social contribu-
tion.
NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT):
	
NB-IoT is an energy-saving wireless standard that is best suited 
for small data volumes sent at long intervals. NB-IoT devices 
have a large operating range and long battery service lives. 
Consequently, this technology provides the basis for many 
innovative uses that are both cost- and energy-efficient. Par-
ticularly useful areas of application for NB-IoT include smart 
parking, smart waste management, smart air quality monitor-
ing, smart metering, as well as transport and logistics solu-
tions. We use NB-IoT to support, among other things, the net-
working of irrigation systems.
LTE-M:
	
The LTE-M standard offers sufficient bandwidth for medium 
volumes of data, low-cost hardware, and sufficient battery ser-
vice life for long use without access to a power supply. This 
makes it ideal, for instance, for e-health solutions where vital 
signs are sent to the cloud, or for monitoring cold chains in 
logistics.
4G/5G:
	
4G technology is suitable for IoT applications with high data 
requirements such as VR (virtual reality) glasses or video sur-
veillance. If fast response times are also needed, for instance 
with self-driving vehicles or for the use of video drones, 5G 
technology provides the better solution.
IoT supports various applications, such as smart metering that 
measures energy data using electronic meters that can be read 
remotely. Heat suppliers Danpower and enercity contracting are 
using automated reading and processing of meter data to optimize 
their heat generation and, in turn, to cut CO₂. The companies are 
using a solution from Deutsche Telekom to provide secure remote 
meter reading. The IoT solution not only meets the statutory 
requirements of the European Efficiency Directive. It also ensures 
regular consumption monitoring and optimization of energy con-
sumption.
Deutsche Telekom together with the company PSsystec has devel-
oped the “IoT Energymonitor” for more sustainable energy man-
agement. The energy measurement system can efficiently deter-
mine the consumption figures for electricity, gas, heat, and water 
of buildings thanks to wireless technologies. Data is provided 
securely using LTE-M and NB-IoT in the Telekom Cloud of Things 
platform by being transferred via a gateway over the mobile com-
munications network and is always available. Constantly measur-
ing and supplying data allows the energy consumption in build-
ings to be adapted rapidly, improving energy efficiency in the pro-
cess.
To combat pollution of the seas, the Dutch company RanMarine 
Technology has developed an autonomously floating drone for 
cleaning water. The drone swims purposefully around polluted 
waterways swallowing up waste. It uses Deutsche Telekom’s Pre-
cise Positioning system for pinpoint navigation. It enhances the 
accuracy of conventional GPS systems by using a global network 
of base stations that measures local interference of the signals 
from GPS satellites and sends this data to the cloud. From there, 
corrected position data is sent to the floating drone.  This means 
the drone does not need any breaks or detours and can find its 
way reliably to the charging and unloading station. Thanks to 
Deutsche Telekom’s Precise Positioning solution the drone moves 
along the defined course more efficiently. It requires fewer charg-
ing cycles and can collect more waste in the water in the same 
amount of time.
Heavy rainfall events are on the increase due to climate change. 
Together with software company Spekter, Deutsche Telekom 
offers an innovative heavy rain early warning system for towns and 
cities. IoT sensors measure precipitation and water levels and give 
an early warning when critical values are exceeded. The Deutsche 
Telekom wireless standard NB-IoT is used to network precipitation 
and water level gauges.
Artificial intelligence
 Artificial intelligence (AI) offers huge potential to allow more peo-
ple to participate in the digital world, to promote education and 
healthcare, and to make our everyday lives fundamentally easier. 
The development of new AI application scenarios, however, opens 
up new ethical challenges. The use of AI can, for instance, under-
mine the diversity of opinion, exacerbate inequalities, or spread 
prejudice. We are one of the first companies worldwide to have 
developed ethical AI guidelines as guardrails for the use of AI at 
Deutsche Telekom. Find out more here.
AI-based solutions are also conceivable for modern-day environ-
mental problems, such as for combating the climate crisis, main-
taining biodiversity, water security, or resilience against natural 
disasters. AI can help detect forest fires or floods early on and to 
initiate remedial measures in good time. It can also help develop 
and optimize production processes, for instance with saving 
important resources. Yet the use of AI also poses major challenges 
in an environmental context. As technologies become increasingly 
complex, energy consumption rises for training and using AI mod-
els. Likewise, as user numbers rise, so does energy demand. This 
raises issues of sustainable resource utilization – such as in rela-
tion to cooling water in data centers.
Our aim is to design AI to be as sustainable as possible right from 
the development stage and during usage. Since 2021, Deutsche 
Telekom has been sourcing all its energy as green electricity. At 
the same time, we aim to use AI specifically to enable and drive 
forward sustainable solutions. For example, we are currently test-
ing how many people are located near to certain mobile antennas 
at which times of the day. Based on the results, a demand-based 
algorithm can be used to automatically switch certain frequency 
bands on and off – and so help save energy. To achieve our 
AI-related goals, we are collaborating across units at Deutsche 
Telekom.

We are discussing the opportunities of technological develop-
ments and the associated challenges, looking at relevant solutions, 
beyond the confines of our Group. For instance, at this year’s Digi-
tal X or also as part of the “Grüne künstliche Intelligenz (Green arti-
ficial intelligence)” episode of the sustainability magazine show 
“Heute retten wir die Welt! Ein bisschen (Today we’re saving the 
world! A little bit; only available in German).” launched at Magen-
taTV in the year under review.
Accessible products and services
We want to make it easier for everyone to have access to the 
knowledge and information society. With that in mind, we offer 
barrier-free, non-discriminatory access to our digital and non-digi-
tal products and services.  To this end, we also offer people with 
disabilities access to specially tailored services and are also com-
mitted in our national companies to providing barrier-free access 
to our services. Further information is available in the respective 
segments.
Service for people with hearing difficulties
We set up a hotline (Deaf Hotline) in Germany for the deaf and 
hearing-impaired in 2003. In the year under review, this service 
was requested 4 500 times in Germany. Customers and consult-
ants can see each other using a video-based live chat application 
and can communicate with each other in sign language. Also, we 
offer a chat service in which specially trained staff advise deaf and 
hearing-impaired persons in simplified language.
For deaf customers and members of the German deaf association, 
Deutscher Gehörlosen-Bund e.V., we operate a special online dis-
tribution site. There, we offer a discounted mobile-communica-
tions and fixed-line portfolio that is tailored to the exact needs of 
hearing-impaired persons. Via the website, customers can either 
book desired rates directly or contact our Deaf Hotline.
Since 2018, hearing-impaired people in Germany have had access 
to a 24-hour emergency-call service with sign language interpret-
ers for emergency situations. The service is jointly financed by the 
mandatory social security contribution paid by Deutsche Telekom 
to Germany’s Bundesnetzagentur (Federal Network Agency).
Barrier-free program on the Special Olympics World Games 
2023
In summer 2023, Deutsche Telekom supported the Special Olym-
pics World Games Berlin as a premium partner. We provided tele-
communication services and broadcast the pre-event and live 
reporting from Berlin via our streaming service MagentaTV as part 
of the German Media Alliance. Deutsche Telekom was the only 
company from the eleven partners in the Media Alliance to provide 
the content on the summer games entirely barrier-free – on 
MagentaTV and on the eponymous YouTube channel with subtitles, 
audio description, and in German sign language.
Support through simple or simplified language
According to studies, 12 percent of people in Germany are not 
able to grasp complicated texts. For that reason, parts of our www.
telekom.com website, of the Teachtoday Academy and individual 
thematic pages under “Specials” are offered in this CR report in 
simple language.
“Schubkraft” (“Thrust”) program: funding options for sustain-
able digitalization
Through our “Schubkraft” program we are supporting businesses 
and municipalities to leverage the advantages of digitalization 
while also helping achieve climate targets in Germany.
Our program offers:
	
Access to funding options: We provide an overview of around 
3 000 government funding programs. By doing so, we would 
like to break down barriers and, with our expertise, help busi-
nesses and municipalities access financial resources for sus-
tainable and innovative projects. More information is available 
here (only available in German).
	
Digital support: Our free app “Meine Förderung” (“My Fund-
ing”), (available in the app stores for iOS and Google Play) 
informs businesses and interested parties about suitable fund-
ing options. Since its rollout, the app has already been down-
loaded over 6 000 times.
	
Personal advice: Our team of experts is on hand to provide 
individual advice. As part of direct conversations, we can 
address specific requirements and questions and suggest tai-
lor-made solutions.
Through “Schubkraft” we aim to ensure that digitalization in Ger-
many is not only structured from an economic, but also from a 
socially and environmentally responsible viewpoint. With this 
approach we would like to make a positive contribution for society, 
while promoting the competitiveness and innovativeness of our 
customers.
Germany segment: digitalization as facilitator for a sustaina-
ble future
Telekom Nachhaltigkeitsmanager
Digital solutions for sustainability management and reporting 
make it easier to fulfill upcoming reporting obligations. Since 
2022, the “Telekom Nachhaltigkeitsmanager (Telekom Sustainabil-
ity Manager)” (only available in German) has been offering the 
Germany segment a digital toolkit, which is being constantly 
extended to fulfill more and more new requirements. The central 
platform consolidates sustainability data, calculates emissions 
across all three scopes, and creates legally compliant sustainabil-
ity reports. Sustainability targets can be defined by recording the 
enterprise’s environmental impacts, and measures managed to 
reduce emissions.
“Digital X” – Technology at your fingertips
In September 2023, we again became an official cooperation 
partner for “Digital X” in Cologne – Europe’s leading digitalization 
initiative. On an area of two million square meters, it offered 
inspiration, new perspectives, and technology up close for visitors 
over two days. This year’s motto was “Be digital. Stay human.” 
“Sustainability & Responsibility” was one of the four megatrends 
alongside “Connected Business”, “Security” and the “Future of 
Work”. To focus the event on sustainability, we have targeted the 
areas of climate protection, resource efficiency, and the circular 
economy and, among other things, paid special attention to easy

accessibility of the event venues by public transport. 50 000 visi-
tors attended the event along with 250 speakers.
Systems Solutions segment: products and customer 
enablement
T-Systems has set itself the goal of becoming the leading provider 
for sustainable IT services and also making a major contribution in 
this role to reducing CO₂ emissions of Deutsche Telekom. To this 
end, the segment set up its own program in 2020, which not only 
looks at its own processes, but also examines the products on offer 
and the enablement of business customers. T‑Systems enables its 
customers and partners to increase their sustainability perfor-
mance by transparently structuring their own value chain, and 
offering leading digital sustainability solutions and consulting.
Enablement of customers
T‑Systems continually determines the environmental impact of its 
products and services and makes this transparent to customers. To 
do so, the company uses various technologies and tools developed 
in-house such as the “susTain Calculator”. This tool allows prospec-
tive new customers to calculate what CO₂ emissions they can save 
by switching to the IT infrastructure and the services of T‑Systems. 
To determine the carbon footprint of solutions, T‑Systems uses an 
impact measurement approach in accordance with the Group-
wide Impact Measurement Blueprint, that also includes social and 
economic factors and looks at the entire value chain. An important 
factor in impact measurement consists of the positive carbon-
footprint impacts our customers realize through the use of 
T‑Systems’ ICT solutions. To constantly improve the methodology, 
T‑Systems collaborated in the year under review with Telekom 
Deutschland and Group Corporate Responsibility to develop a tool 
for calculating the carbon footprint of products.
More sustainable products and solutions
T‑Systems’ goal is to continually increase the number of more sus-
tainable products and digital solutions in its portfolio. The seg-
ment offers industry-specific and cross-industry solutions.
Together with the technology consulting provider Detecon, 
T‑Systems supports business customers with developing digital 
sustainability strategies based on its “DigiTainability” approach. 
DigiTainability entails striking a balance between the following 
elements: The use of digital technologies to increase resource effi-
ciency, the reduction of negative environmental, economic, and 
social impacts, while also designing digital technologies to be 
more sustainable. The consulting lineup includes strategic consult-
ing for transformation, ESG transparency and reporting, sustaina-
ble supply chain management, green IT initiatives, and data intelli-
gence for sustainability.
With its solutions, T‑Systems helps its business customers to col-
lect, monitor, document, and improve all sustainability-related 
data for their organization and beyond. The T‑Systems’ products 
include the Syrah SDG Dashboard or the Supply Chain Transpar-
ency Suite, a solution designed to fulfill obligations under the 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspfli-
chtengesetz – LkSG). With Ambika, T‑Systems has also rolled out  
a cloud-based infrastructure management system for electric car 
charging stations.
T‑Systems also helps its customers implement digital solutions 
that are ideal for their specific sustainability requirements. T‑Sys-
tems provides solutions for the mobility and logistics sectors that 
facilitate the wide-ranging digitalization of airports, thereby help-
ing make workflows more efficient. For the public sector, T‑Sys-
tems offers a solution in the shape of PEGA that promotes the digi-
talization of government administrative processes and, among 
other things, saves paper and reduces travel. Examples of the 
impact that our solutions have can be found here.
Besides the focus on products and services that can make cus-
tomers more sustainable, T‑Systems is increasingly working on 
taking account of sustainability criteria right from the actual devel-
opment process. To minimize the carbon footprint of new and 
existing solutions, T‑Systems has developed nine principles for 
sustainable solution design and published these internally in the 
year under review. The Environmental Sustainability Design Princi-
ples should provide a guide for all T‑Systems’ employees that 
helps them design applications and solutions more efficiently from 
a carbon footprint and energy consumption viewpoint. T‑Systems 
also provides its employees with supporting web-based training 
courses to make the issue easier to understand. More information 
on environmental product design at Deutsche Telekom can be 
found here.
Cooperative partnership
Together with our customers we are working on accelerating the 
digital transformation and investing in new business models that 
focus on the decarbonization of society. With Co-Creation Advi-
sory, T‑Systems set up an initiative in 2023 to promote cross-
industry collaboration in the field of sustainability. Over 100  
T‑Systems’ customers took part in the accompanying three-part 
event series, the Co-Creation Advisory Board for Sustainability, and 
were actively involved in developing specific solutions. Together 
with them, we have developed nine new solutions for the area of  
sustainability in the year under review. The initiative will continue 
in 2024 under the name X-Creation and a close partnership with 
the United Nations Global Innovation Hub. Interested parties from 
business, the research sector, organizations, and the public admin-
istration will again gather in the Co-Creation and work together on 
ideas. 
T‑Systems remains in close contact with customers and suppliers 
to consistently reduce CO₂ emissions. Memoranda of understand-
ing were signed with key suppliers Lenovo, Cisco, and Fortinet to 
work jointly to address the topics of energy efficiency and climate 
neutrality. T‑Systems and the technology company Lenovo, which 
supplies components for the cloud solution Future Cloud Infra-
structure (FCI), are working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
in the supply chain, for instance.
Additionally, T‑Systems is an industry partner to legislators and the 
research sector. One example of this is our partnership with the 
Fraunhofer Institute, with whom we are developing innovative 
green technologies for cloud computing. Another example, this 
time at international level, is our partnership with the University 
of Granada, which sees us establishing a Chair of Innovations in 
Digital Sustainability to drive research activity in this area.

Our approach to infrastructure rollout
Having access to state-of-the-art information technologies is a 
precondition for economic performance and participation in a 
knowledge and information society. That is why we are continuing 
to rapidly expand our infrastructure and improve transmission 
speeds with new, secure technology.
Demand for faster data services with full-coverage availability is 
growing continuously. In 2023, we invested more than EUR 16 bil-
lion Group-wide, primarily in building and operating networks. 
Around EUR 4.6 billion of this figure was earmarked for the Ger-
many operating segment alone. This is in addition to the invest-
ments that we make in acquiring mobile spectrum. Hence, the 
majority of the Group’s investment volume in Germany is for the 
build-out of broadband networks. This build-out is based on the 
goals of our Europe-wide integrated network strategy, which we 
use to help achieve the EU Commission’s network build-out tar-
gets and the Federal Government’s Digital Agenda and broadband 
strategy. The strategy is founded on the two pillars of building out 
mobile and fixed networks, with the focus of the former being on 
5G coverage – the most powerful technology standard currently 
available.
Thanks to our investments, our customers are enjoying better net-
work coverage and fast mobile broadband service. In mobile com-
munications, we set ourselves apart from our competitors with the 
quality of our network that has been singled out for awards with 
independent network tests. Further information on our awards can 
be found here.
In the fixed network, we are focusing on rolling out our optical fiber 
to provide our customers with a reliable connection at gigabit 
speeds. With our FTTH (fiber to the home) expansion, we are 
installing fiber-optic connections directly in customers’ homes. 
Our aim is to close gaps in the network in rural areas and provide 
urban centers with the high bandwidth they require. We have 
almost completed our FTTC (fiber to the curb) build-out in the 
fixed network in Germany. We want to continue this rollout effi-
ciently and, to this end, are also participating in funding programs. 
In the coming years, we expect to provide FTTH to over 2.5 million 
households per year.
As well as the pure fiber-optic lines, we are also offering other 
innovative products: for example, our hybrid router, which com-
bines the transmission bandwidths of fixed-network and mobile 
communications, thus attaining higher transmission speeds – 
particularly in rural areas.
Germany segment: progress with network build-out
We continued to build out our network infrastructure in Germany 
throughout the reporting year. At the end of 2023, our 5G network 
covered 95.9 percent of the population, with over 80 000 anten-
nas transmitting 5G across Germany. Around 10 000 of these 
antennas use the fast 5G spectrum in the 3.6 GHz band. Our rigor-
ous focus on 5G will continue in 2024. In the year ahead, 5G stan-
dalone will also be made available for use by consumers. Our busi-
ness customers already use this technology with functions like 
network slicing, e.g., for live TV broadcasts of media, or in 5G cam-
pus networks for industry and research.
In the fixed network build-out, optical fiber continued to take 
center stage. By the end of 2023, we had made more than 2.5 mil-
lion more fiber-optic lines available in Germany. In other words, we 
achieved our build-out target for the year, bringing the total num-
ber of households and businesses with the option to subscribe to a 
fiber-optic line to around 8 million.
In the reporting year, Deutsche Telekom established its own civil 
engineering company to ensure further acceleration of the net-
work build-out. This move serves to address the pressing need for 
civil engineering capacities on the German market. The civil engi-
neering company Deutsche Telekom Tiefbau GmbH is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Telekom Deutschland and will focus on con-
necting homes.
In addition to its own build-out efforts, Deutsche Telekom also 
relies on partnerships as an important mainstay of the build-out. 
We have a total of around 40 partnerships in place on the joint 
construction, operation, or use of fiber-optic infrastructure. Along-
side collaborating with regional partners (among other places in 
several districts in the Stuttgart region, in Upper Franconia and the 
Upper Palatinate, in Bavarian Swabia, and in North Hesse), we have 
also agreed framework conditions with organizations including the 
central association of the German housing industry for our fiber-
optic build-out to properties managed by this sector. Furthermore, 
June 2023 marked the start of the implementation phase of the 
Saxon State Ministry of Education and Cultural Affairs’ broadband 
access initiative to connect schools across Saxony to our fiber-
optic network.

United States segment: progress with network build-out
As of the end of 2023, T-Mobile US’ 5G network covered around 
98 percent of the U.S. population, with over 300 million people 
benefiting from Ultra Capacity 5G (5G UC). T-Mobile US has thus 
hit its year-end target for 2023 for 5G UC coverage.
On September 12, 2023, T-Mobile US agreed with U.S. cable net-
work operator Comcast to acquire spectrum licenses in the 600 
MHz band in exchange for total cash consideration of between 
USD 1.2 billion and USD 3.3 billion. The transaction is expected to 
be closed in the first half of 2028.

Europe segment: progress with network build-out
In the countries of our Europe segment, too, we substantially 
intensified the network build-out in the reporting year. As of the 
end of 2023, our national companies covered on average 67.2 per-
cent of the population in our European footprint with 5G, repre-
senting a significant increase year-on-year.
We also made particularly good progress with the build-out of our 
fixed network in our European national companies in 2023. At the 
end of 2023, a total of around 9.1 million households, which 
means around 1 million additional households compared with the 
prior year, had access to our fiber-optic network offering gigabit 
speeds.
We continue to systematically execute on our strategy regarding 
the shared use of networks, and to this end, our national compa-
nies in Europe also agreed and finalized further partnerships on the 
fiber-optic build-out in the reporting year. Alpen Glasfaser, a coop-
eration between Magenta Telekom and Meridiam, started opera-
tions in Austria in March 2023. In Poland, T-Mobile Polska entered 
into an agreement with Vectra Group in the second half of 2023 on 
access to Vectra’s fiber-optic network, and announced it is estab-
lishing a cooperation with Polish Open Fiber that will give us 
access to their fiber-optic network.

Rollout of the new 5G mobile generation
With 5G, we are creating a highly reliable mobile network with 
extremely low latency and high data throughput. Over 80 000 
antennas are now operating at the 5G standard in Germany. As of 
the end of 2023, over 10 000 of these antennas in more than 800 
towns, cities, and communities were using the fast 5G spectrum in 
the 3.6 GHz band. By the end of 2023, 95.9 percent of the popula-
tion of Germany was already covered by our 5G network. By the 
end of 2025, 5G is set to cover 90 percent of Germany, reaching 
99 percent of the population. We additionally want to offer 5G 
standalone for consumers in 2024. Deutsche Telekom’s business 
customers already use this technology with features like network 
slicing, e.g., for live TV broadcasts or in 5G campus networks for 
industry and research. As of the end of 2023, our national compa-
nies covered on average 67.2 percent of the population in our 
European footprint with 5G. T-Mobile US’ 5G network covered 
around 98 percent of the U.S. population at the end of the report-
ing year, with over 300 million people benefiting from Ultra 
Capacity 5G.
Since 2022, Telekom Deutschland has been directing the 6G-Take-
Off research project, which is being funded by the German Federal 
Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). The project is aimed 
at developing a consistent 6G architecture for communications 
networks, consisting of satellite access stations, airborne infra-
structure platforms and satellites. A total of 22 industry and scien-
tific partners are collaborating in the effort. The first 6G networks 
are expected to become operational in 2030.

Continuing expansion of the fiber-optic network
Deutsche Telekom’s fiber-optic network is the largest in Europe, 
with a length of over 750 000 kilometers in Germany alone (as of 
December 2023). As global data traffic continues to grow rapidly, 
we are continuing to expand our fiber-optic network. To do this as 
quickly and efficiently as possible, we use planning software and 
modern deployment methods such as trenching. Via our build-out 
tracker (only available in German) for Germany, we provide clear 
reports on our progress.
To expand the fiber-optic network, we are using FTTC (fiber to the 
curb) technology with super vectoring and are building out FTTH 
(fiber to the home) as well.

Updating and stabilizing the network architecture
The fundamental aim is to operate our networks in the most stable 
and failure-free manner possible. Major events such as festivals 
and summit meetings place networks under particular strain. We 
make sure, however, that voice calls and data are still transmitted 
in the quality our customers have come to expect by temporarily 
setting up extra mobile masts or laying additional fiber-optic 
cables.
In emergency situations, it is especially important for networks to 
function properly, so that emergency calls can be made and 
responses organized. In emergencies, such as floods or large fires, 
in which network equipment is damaged to the point that mobile 
and fixed-line services cannot be quickly restored, our Disaster 
Recovery Management (DRM) (only available in German) comes 
into play. It operates mobile containers with communications 
equipment that can quickly stand in for disrupted cellular and 
fixed-line service.
In the interest of even faster network restoration following extreme 
events, Deutsche Telekom’s DRM team is working to provide a sat-
ellite-based mobile base station. Such a station would make it 
possible to establish a mobile network within just a few hours. This 
project is currently in its pilot phase in the lower Franconian city of 
Fuchsstadt. The first trials with the new system have been promis-
ing, and it seems as if it will indeed be possible in the future to 
restore service very quickly following extreme events.

Our approach to top service quality in Germany
At Deutsche Telekom we put people front and center, especially 
our customers and our employees. We examine our workflows 
from our customers’ perspective and invest in our employees’ 
expertise as well as in IT tools for them and our customers. Our aim 
is to handle customer inquiries quickly and fully right from the first 
contact and to be perceived as friendly and reliable as we do so. In 
the reporting year, our investments in the area of customer service 
and the associated customer satisfaction were rewarded: in 2023, 
we made it into the top 10 most valuable brands in the world in 
the "Brand Finance Global 500" study. We also remain the most 
valuable corporate brand in Europe.  The Brand-Z study by  
Kantar also confirmed that Deutsche Telekom is the most valuable 
German brand - partly due to the high level of trust customers 
place in our brand.
The following examples show how we implement our service offer-
ing in the Germany segment:
Very active service in 2023I
n 2023 in Germany, we had a total of 30 000 employees providing 
service to our 60 million mobile and fixed-network customers, 
making a total of 60 million personal contacts in the process. We 
solve around 70 percent of inquiries in the first customer contact. 
Also in the year under review, callers to our service hotline had to 
wait less than 90 seconds on average to speak with a service rep-
resentative. In the same year, the percentage of service technician 
appointments that failed to take place was 0.6 percent. Our good 
service is paying off: Since 2017, we have been able to cut the 
number of customer complaints in Germany by a total of 90 per-
cent.
Arranging appointments with Deutsche Telekom
The online appointment booking tool (only available in German) is 
an easy way for customers to book their consultations and service 
appointments. They can decide for themselves in which form they 
would like to receive advice. They can choose between a consulta-
tion in a Telekom Shop or at home. Deutsche Telekom engineer 
appointments can also be booked online. Customers can also use 
the tool to arrange an appointment for queries which can be 
resolved via phone call or video chat.
Customers using the “Mein Telekom Techniker” (My Telekom  
Engineer) app can see with a tap on their smartphone when they 
can expect our service engineers to arrive. They will also be sent a 
text message in advance, reminding them of the scheduled visit. 
This message includes a link to access virtually real-time updates 
on the engineer’s anticipated arrival time. If customers’ plans sud-
denly change, they can reschedule appointments with just a few 
taps on their phone. And once a job is underway, it is also possible 
to monitor the service engineer’s progress step by step. This can 
be helpful, for example, when excavation work is required.
Always available – even in the crisis
We also reacted swiftly after Russia began its war of aggression 
against Ukraine in early 2022: On top of their day-to-day work, our 
sales and service employees helped out with initiatives such as 
distributing free SIM cards to refugees at the Telekom Shops and 
central points of contact – sometimes even outside of their work-
ing hours. They were on hand to respond to any questions or issues 
from refugees. Employees have joined forces to coordinate various 
relief measures and are continuing this work together.
Customer service from the region for the region
We have established a total of 14 regional centers, known as 
“Regiocenters,” in major cities in Germany, with the last opening in 
April 2022. These centers’ service teams serve customers’ needs 
throughout their regions, including customers in both urban and 
rural areas. Each such center offers a full range of service expertise 
and products in the region, from back-office support and technical 
customer service to field service, shops, and equipment. Customer 
calls are automatically forwarded to the relevant Regiocenter, 
which will be able to directly handle all types of concerns – mobile 
network, fixed network, service disruption, or a field service 
request.
Promoting skills
We continuously provide our service employees with training on 
products and services. They can learn about and try out the latest 
solutions in specially equipped rooms at our service centers. We 
have also intensified our personal coaching by team leaders in 
everyday work. Knowledge databases and digital tools are ena-
bling our employees to address customers' concerns more and 
more quickly.
The high quality of our services has been independently verified  
by numerous successes in tests. For example, in 2023 the business 
magazine Focus Money once again honored us as a “Service King.” 
For its awards, Focus Money conducted a survey of almost 
300 000 people, asking which companies they thought gave them 
the best service. Awards such as these show that we are on the 
right track. You can find details of other awards for Sales & Service 
here.

Improving contact and process quality
We want to give all customers the best service experience. To 
meet that goal, several million responses from our customers are 
annually collected and analyzed by our quality management team. 
Customer satisfaction and resolving their request on first contact 
are our top priorities.
Our surveys are conducted either directly after a contact (for 
example, via the hotline, in a shop, on a field service call, or after an 
online inquiry by email or chat) or a completed process (for exam-
ple, after service provisioning).
If a customer tells us in a survey that their request has not yet been 
resolved, a callback offer is made to clarify the request once and 
for all. The results of customer surveys are also used for internal 
training of our customer advisors.
In the year under review, we managed to increase the Net Pro-
moter Score (NPS), which we use to measure customer satisfac-
tion, to 40 (23 in the prior year). The classification uses a scale of 
-100 to +100. We attribute the improvement to our “Green-to-
Magenta” transformation program and various measures designed 
to increase customer satisfaction: For instance to the increase in 
the first-call resolution rate from 56.1 percent in 2022 to 69 per-
cent in the year under review and to the reduction of the waiting 
times to an average 90 seconds at present. We have also driven 
forward the training of our employees and the Day-1 attitude that 
requires our employees to constantly examine processes and 
workflows for the need for optimization.
Measuring customer retention and endorsement
We use the TRI*M index to gauge customer retention and regularly 
participate in benchmarking. The recorded data is based on a cus-
tomer survey conducted in all markets and segments (excluding 
T-Mobile US). To measure the TRI*M value, customers are asked 
four standardized questions – for example, whether they would 
recommend Deutsche Telekom to others; their answers are com-
piled in a key performance indicator. The TRI*M value for the 
Deutsche Telekom Group is calculated as an overall value from  
the individual measurement results of the countries or segments.
At the end of the year under review, the indicator for the Group 
(excluding T-Mobile US) came in at 76.2 points versus an adjusted 
value of 75.0 points at the start of the year (both determined on a 
comparable basis). Following changes to the revenue shares con-
tributed by each country and in order to create an equivalent basis 
for comparing the Group’s expectations with actual figures, we 
recalculated the baseline figure for 2023 on the basis of the new 
structures these changes entailed. The new baseline thus diverges 
from the figure of 76.0 reported as of December 31, 2022. As a 
result, the index value improved, and we firmly achieved our Group 
aim of increasing it slightly. The Germany and T-Systems seg-
ments contributed to the very positive development in particular 
with significant improvements in customer loyalty. The EU  
segment also contributed to these results with an increase in  
customer loyalty.
At 72.4 points, the TRI*M index for Germany is significantly higher 
than in the previous year (71.6). It is also considerably higher than 
the comparable figures for the competition when it comes to both 
consumers and business customers. We also experienced a slight 
improvement in our EU business segment, from 70.4 to 70.6, while 
the TRI*M index for T-Systems actually increased to 95 from a 
baseline of 91 points. In sum, we once again reached our overall 
goal of a slight increase for the Group as a whole. Thanks to the 
figures achieved at Telekom Deutschland and T-Systems in par-
ticular, we are in a leading position compared with the competitor 
benchmark.  We expect to maintain these figures for 2024. Our 
aim for the EU segment is to achieve a slight improvement.
Customer satisfaction and loyalty scores are factored into both the 
long-term variable remuneration scheme for our board members 
and, to an extent, the performance assessments of our managers, 
meaning some of their variable salary components are linked to 
these ratings.

Our approach to consumer protection
Consumer protection is a multi-faceted topic at Deutsche 
Telekom. A core element is keeping our customers’ data safe and 
secure. Data protection and data security are therefore top priori-
ties for us.
Children and young people, in particular, need to be shielded from 
dangers online. That’s why protecting children and young people 
also plays a big part in what we do. We take youth protection 
aspects into consideration in our product and service design. 
When we develop services that are relevant in terms of youth pro-
tection in Germany, we consult our youth protection officer for 
suggestions of restrictions or changes. We have appointed a child 
safety officer (CSO) at each of our national companies within the 
EU who is responsible for issues pertaining to the protection of 
minors. The CSO acts as a central contact for stakeholders from 
the community in the respective country and plays a key internal 
role in coordinating issues related to youth protection. We thereby 
strengthen Deutsche Telekom’s lasting and transparent commit-
ment to protecting minors.
In addition, we strive to ensure that our networks are safe to use. 
We study the latest scientific research on mobile communications 
and health, and we provide our customers with transparent 
updates in this regard.
Our approach to protection of minors in the media
We want to protect children and young people when using digital 
media. We pursue a three-pillar strategy to do this:
	
We provide attractive, age-appropriate offers for children. We 
give parents and legal guardians the information they need in 
order to be able to protect their children against inappropriate 
content.
	
We participate in combating child abuse and its depiction to 
the extent that this is permitted in relation to the rules govern-
ing net neutrality and in the framework of European and 
national law.
	
We implement various measures to ensure that young people 
acquire media skills and can interact safely with online content.
We also collaborate closely with prosecuting authorities and NGOs 
as well as other partners from business, politics, and society to ban 
online content that is harmful to children and young people. We 
have anchored our commitment to protecting minors from unsuit-
able media content in Germany in relevant codes and introduced 
minimum standards. In 2007, we committed ourselves to fighting 
child pornography on the internet throughout the European Union. 
GSMA (an association representing the interests of mobile opera-
tors worldwide), of which we have been a member since 2008, 
pursues the same objectives at a global level.
To better coordinate our activities within the Group, we have been 
following binding general guidelines since 2013 for our activities 
to help protect minors against inappropriate media content, and 
have, in turn, set standards in our markets. In consideration of their 
particular cultural situation and business model, each international 
subsidiary in the European Union can further specify these meas-
ures and adopt additional measures to determine their own strate-
gic focal points.
Cooperation with organizations and programs for the protection 
of minors
Protecting minors from unsuitable media content poses a chal-
lenge that affects many industries. We therefore work together 
with different organizations for the protection of minors and par-
ticipate in coalitions that coordinate the involvement of companies 
and organizations from the internet and media sector.
We assumed a leading role through January 2023 with the “ICT 
Coalition for Children Online,” a project funded in cooperation with 
the EU Commission. With our involvement in the ICT Coalition, we 
pursued a comprehensive and cross-industry approach based on 
six principles that expressly included helping young people learn 
media skills. In January 2023, the work of the ICT Coalition was 
stopped as the EU Commission set new priorities for the protec-
tion of minors.
We also promote various initiatives and programs aimed at pro-
tecting children and young people in cyberspace. For example, we 
are a founding member of the association fragFINN, which pro-
vides a safe online surfing environment for children between the 
ages of six and twelve. The search engine on fragFINN.de and its 
associated browser app turn up websites that are suitable for chil-
dren and have been reviewed by media educators. We are also a 
member of JusProg e.V., a non-profit association that works to 
improve protection for children and young people online. Its 
youth-protection program JusProg, which is available for down-
load and use free of charge, filters out age-inappropriate online 
content.

Our approach to safe mobile communication
We want to make our mobile communications infrastructure and 
our products, as well as the processes on which they are based, as 
resource-efficient, secure, and safe for health as possible. In Ger-
many these activities are based in particular on voluntary commit-
ments by the mobile sector and a mobile communications agree-
ment with local authorities’ associations. External experts review 
compliance with these voluntary commitments every two years. In 
2022, the mobile network operators presented the latest mobile 
communications expert report (for 2020 and 2021; only available 
in German) to the German government, which was coordinated, 
written and published by the Deutsches Institut für Urbanistik 
(German Institute for Urban Studies). According to the report, the 
mobile build-out is progressing smoothly for the most part, with 
the few controversial issues down to isolated incidents. To provide 
a representative estimate, the report surveyed over 1 700 munici-
palities throughout Germany, with 90 percent of them reporting 
they had few or no controversial cases to decide. The next mobile 
communications expert report is slated for 2024.
In June 2023, we signed a new commitment with the German 
government, together with the three other network operators 
working in Germany. This commitment relates to information, 
communication, and health measures with the build-out of mobile 
communications networks and applies for five years, after which it 
is renewed for another year in each case unless the parties actively 
terminate the agreement. More details of the content of the com-
mitment can be obtained from the Federal Ministry for the Envi-
ronment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Pro-
tection (BMUV; only available in German).
As early as June 2020, together with the leading municipal associ-
ations and other German network operators, the existing agree-
ment on the exchange of information for the build-out of mobile 
networks (only available in German) that has been in place since 
2001 was revised and updated. This ensures that cities and munic-
ipalities are involved in the setting up of mobile-communication 
and small-cell networks to facilitate build-out that is as fast and 
conflict-free as possible.
Policy on Electromagnetic Fields
The Policy on Electromagnetic Fields (EMF), which we updated in 
the year under review, in force throughout the Group since 2004, 
plays a primary role: Our EMF Policy contains uniform minimum 
requirements for mobile communications and health that go far 
beyond the national legal requirements. Our policy provides our 
national companies with a mandatory framework that makes sure 
that the topic of mobile communications and health is addressed 
in a consistent, responsible way throughout the Group. The Euro-
pean national companies have accepted the EMF Policy and 
implemented most of the required measures.
Our EMF Policy stipulates the following principles and measures:
Transparency
We are committed to transparency and sincerity in mobile com-
munications, especially when it comes to questions concerning 
the network build-out and health and safety. We make all relevant 
information regarding our mobile communications equipment in 
Germany accessible to the public, e.g., in the site database oper-
ated by the German Bundesnetzagentur.
Information
We provide consumer information that is easy to understand and 
are committed to supplying fact-based, sound information – 
which is why we provide up-to-date brochures and information on 
the Group’s website for anyone who may be interested. We also 
provide our customers with information online on the SAR levels of 
their mobile devices. Additional details are also available in the 
shops and through our free environmental hotline.
Participation
We rely on close collaboration and constructive dialog with the 
cities and municipalities involved. For example, we inform local 
government of our build-out plans at an early stage, including 
them in considerations for new locations, and answer critical ques-
tions from residents. For us, fairness in the face of critical argu-
ments and readiness to subject our own position to renewed 
review are vital in order to succeed in achieving compromises.
Scientific facts
Over the past few decades, the effect of electromagnetic fields on 
health has been the subject of in-depth scientific research. 
Deutsche Telekom therefore continually monitors scientific 
research developments and bases its communications on new sci-
entific risk assessments from expert committees such as the Inter-
national Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 
(ICNIRP) and other recognized specialist organizations.
We conduct ongoing reviews of compliance with our EMF Policy. 
Our international working group, the “EMF Core Team”, uses the 
findings to improve individual aspects a to jointly develop solu-
tions.

Mobile communications and health (EMF)
Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are a prevalent part of our con-
nected world, even if we are not able to perceive them directly. 
Their effects on our health remain a topic of discussion. Deutsche 
Telekom, like all providers, must ensure that the statutory thresh-
old values are observed in mobile communications. In Germany, 
the threshold values are set by the German government and are 
based on the recommendations of the International Commission 
on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).
The effects of EMFs have been thoroughly researched over the 
past decades in numerous scientific studies. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) analyzes the findings of scientific research 
and most recently made a statement regarding the results in 
2014. In its statement, it concludes that the current threshold 
values for EMFs ensure that mobile communications technology 
can be used safely and that research should accompany further 
development of the technology. In 2020, after evaluating the latest 
scientific research, the ICNIRP once again confirmed the protec-
tion concept for EMFs, as they are used in mobile communications. 
According to ICNIRP, the threshold values ensure comprehensive 
protection for people and the environment. This also applies to 
frequency ranges used by 5G, because, like earlier network types, 
5G requires high safety standards. Safe operation of mobile com-
munications technology in Germany is therefore ensured.
Since 2020 the Informationszentrum Mobilfunk (Mobile Communi-
cations Information Center) together with the local authorities’ 
associations have published three information brochures on the 
issue of mobile communications (only available in German). The 
content is geared primarily to municipalities and local decision-
makers. In the year under review, the range of information (only 
available in German) was supplemented by videos, articles, and 
podcasts on socially relevant 5G applications, along with explana-
tory videos on the mobile build-out. The Information Center also 
published teaching material (only available in German) on the sub-
ject of technology, environment, and sustainability with mobile 
communications and continued to cooperate with the German 
government’s communications initiative “Germany talks about 5G” 
– including with implementing the community consultations with 
citizens and local politicians.
In cooperation with the three other 5G licensees in Germany, 
Telefónica Germany, Vodafone, and 1&1 Mobilfunk, we support 
Informationszentrum Mobilfunk. The portal provides objective, sci-
entifically sound information about basic issues relating to mobile 
communications, including controversial issues, in the areas of 
health and safety, technology and network build-out, the environ-
ment and sustainability, and politics and legal questions.

Our approach to data privacy
The highest standards of data privacy and data security are part of 
our brand identity. We have developed our active data privacy and 
compliance culture over many years.
The company’s Human Resources and Legal Affairs Board depart-
ment, headed by Board of Management member Birgit Bohle, has 
responsibility for the area of data privacy. The Technology and 
Innovation Board department, headed by Board of Management 
member Claudia Nemat, is responsible for the area of data secu-
rity.
Since 2009, the Group Board of Management has been advised by 
an independent Data Privacy Advisory Board comprising reputable 
experts from politics, science, business, and independent organi-
zations. The Advisory Board is also strengthened through the addi-
tion of new members from the ranks of the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Telekom AG.
Ensuring effective data privacy:
	
Global data privacy organization 
With the help of our globally operating data privacy organiza-
tion, we work constantly to maintain transparent, high data pri-
vacy standards in all of our companies. To achieve this, 
Deutsche Telekom’s data privacy must be highly organized on 
both a national and international level.
	
Policies on data privacy and information security 
To the extent legally possible, our Group companies conform  
to our Binding Corporate Rules Privacy (BCRP), which define 
common, high data privacy standards for our products and ser-
vices. The Group Security Policy includes significant informa-
tion security and data privacy-related principles followed 
within the Group, which are based on the international ISO 
27001 and ISO 27701 standards. The Policy ensures that ade-
quate, consistent security standards are maintained through-
out our entire Group.
	
Consistent transparency vis-à-vis the public 
At www.telekom.com/data-privacy-and-security we provide 
comprehensive information about our data privacy activities. 
We have also published an annual transparency report since 
2014. Moreover, in the Consumer protection section of this CR 
report we explain how we make our products and services safe 
for users.
	
Information on data handling 
We provide transparent information regarding which personal 
data is processed and for what purposes, as well as the length 
of time it will be stored. As a rule, personal data is not for-
warded to third parties. We sometimes use anonymized data 
for analyses, so we can continually improve the quality of our 
offering. These analyses help us spot certain trends better, for 
example, showing us where to improve network coverage.
	
Regular employee training courses 
Telecommunications companies are obliged to provide new 
employees, at the beginning of their employment relationships, 
with information on data privacy regulations. We go above and 
beyond these legal requirements. Every two years, we provide 
training in this area to all Group employees and place them 
under an obligation to uphold data privacy and telecommuni-
cations secrecy. The training courses for our employees also 
cover risks and procedures relating to data security and privacy 
protection.We have also introduced specific training in the cus-
tomer and human resources departments. This training 
includes online courses for independent learning, presenta-
tions on data privacy, and face-to-face courses on specific top-
ics such as data protection at call centers. This helps us ensure 
that all employees have in-depth understanding of the relevant 
data privacy policies.
	
Regular review and adaptation of measures 
We carry out a Group data privacy audit every two years, to 
measure and improve the general data privacy standards 
throughout the Group. For each such audit, we conduct an 
online survey of a total of 15 percent of our Group employees, 
chosen at random. The Group data privacy audit is supple-
mented by internal and external on-site checks.Group Privacy 
assesses the results and checks whether action needs to be 
taken in the respective units. Where necessary, the Global Data 
Privacy Officer calls for improvement measures and, to this 
end, holds personal meetings with the responsible directors, 
managers, and data privacy officers at the different depart-
ments. Group Privacy offers advice on the implementation of 
the measures and determines whether they are effective. We 
take any unusual audit results into consideration when plan-
ning the follow-up audit.
	
Certifications 
We have the security of our processes, management systems, 
products, and services certified by external, independent 
organizations such as TÜV, DEKRA, and auditing firms.

How we handle big data and artificial intelligence
When we process very large volumes of data, we need to take spe-
cial measures to protect citizens’ privacy, To this end, we created in 
2013 mandatory principles for handling big data. In parallel to the 
technological further development, we have since also updated 
our arrangements governing the processing of very large quanti-
ties of personal data – and in 2018 published guidelines on the 
data privacy-compliant design of artificial intelligence (AI). In addi-
tion, we apply a “Ten-point program for better online security” that 
defines specific measures to protect data and the network infra-
structure. We introduced the program in 2015. In this framework, 
we have developed a number of special protection products – 
including the “Telekom Mobile Protect Pro”, which looks for any 
risks in the mobile network that the smartphone is using.
Reviewing our products
Data privacy and security play an important role that starts during 
the development of our products and services. Our Privacy and 
Security Assessment (PSA) procedure allows us to review the 
security of our systems in each step of the development process. 
This procedure applies to newly developed systems as well as to 
existing systems that undergo changes in technology or in the way 
data is processed. We use a standardized procedure to document 
the data privacy and data security status of our products through-
out their entire life cycle.

Transparency report
Telecommunications companies are legally obliged to support 
security authorities in their efforts to uphold security. Companies’ 
obligations in this regard include permitting surveillance/monitor-
ing measures, and providing certain data, when they are ordered 
to do so by authorities.
Internationally, the legal framework for a transparency report in 
this area differs widely from country to country. In some countries, 
we are legally prohibited from providing any information about 
security measures, while in others authorities may directly conduct 
surveillance without any participation on the part of telecommuni-
cations companies. The support we provide for authorities in this 
area is always provided solely on the basis of an unambiguous, 
legally binding legal foundation in the relevant country. Details on 
the different situations in the relevant countries are available on 
our website.
We place great priority on transparency in this area. Since 2014, 
we have published an annual transparency report for Germany; 
since 2016, we have also published an international transparency 
report. In these reports, we reveal – to the extent legally permitted 
– the nature and extent of any information we had to disclose to 
security authorities.

Cybersecurity
Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH is among the world’s largest 
digital security providers. This company, the market leader in Ger-
many, Austria, and Switzerland, marshals the cybersecurity exper-
tise available throughout the entire Deutsche Telekom Group. For 
many years now, it has been successfully protecting our own infra-
structure – and offering our customers the same security solutions 
that protect the Deutsche Telekom Group worldwide. Also, 
Deutsche Telekom Security is working to continually improve 
cooperation in the area of protection against digital threats. To this 
end, it works with many different organizations and associations, 
often as an active member, in Germany and at the EU level. The 
organizations it collaborates with include the German Federal 
Office for Information Security (BSI), Germany’s Bundeskrimini-
alamt (Federal Criminal Police Office, BKA) and the European 
Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA).
In addition, the company collaborates with research institutes, 
industry partners, initiatives, standardization bodies, public institu-
tions, and other internet and telecommunications service provid-
ers worldwide. Together, we want to fight cybercrime and improve 
online security.
We also provide up-to-date information about all of our security 
and data protection activities on our Group website.

Our cybersecurity infrastructure
We are always working to develop new ways to defend against 
attacks. We launched a Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
in the mid-1990s, which is responsible internationally for manag-
ing security incidents for our information and network technolo-
gies. Since then, we have continued to expand our activities in 
relation to cyberdefense, and promote more information and infor-
mation sharing. Since 2020, our CERT has been officially certified 
according to the SIM3 standard (Security Incident Management 
Maturity Model). It is now one of only three German CSIRT (Com-
puter Security Incident Response Team) / CERT organizations that 
comply with this standard.
Cyber Defense Centers
At our Cyber Defense and Security Operations Centers (SOCs), we 
monitor the security situation 24/7, year-round, for ourselves and 
our customers. With the aid of artificial intelligence (AI), the SOCs 
analyze about a billion security-relevant data items, from some  
3 000 data sources, every day. Our security specialists detect 
attacks in real time, and immediately initiate the steps necessary 
to neutralize them or even ward them off completely. In 2023, we 
registered peaks of almost 50 million attacks per day against 
Deutsche Telekom’s “honeypot” systems – systems intentionally

designed to lure attackers. In addition, we actively combat botnets 
(interconnected computers infected with malware) in the 
Deutsche Telekom AG network. We are the only internet provider in 
Europe that safeguards its network in this way. This is how we pro-
tect our infrastructure, and hence also our customers’ data.
Threat Intelligence Team
When we register an attack, our Threat Intelligence team studies it 
to determine precisely how it has been perpetrated. To such ends, 
our Threat Intelligence team consults with, and shares findings 
with, researchers throughout the world. In this way, our team 
always stays abreast of the latest scientific findings – and well 
informed about the threats and perpetrators it faces. Even if we 
cannot always stay a step ahead of cybercriminals, we always try 
to ensure they are well aware of our presence.
In the same way, we also provide other companies with our meas-
ures to fight cyberattacks: More than 30 German DAX companies 
and SMEs employ our services for their own protection.
Protection of personal data
Protecting our customers’ data is one of our top priorities. On our 
Group website, under “Data protection and data security,” we pro-
vide regular – daily, in some cases – information about our com-
mitment in this area.
Although we take a wide range of preventive measures, we cannot 
completely prevent data breaches. In 2023, we recorded a total of 
154 data breaches in Germany. We investigated 32 of these 
breaches as a result of customer complaints, and three as a result 
of complaints of supervisory authorities. On account of an incident 
at a subsidiary, these breaches affected a total of 63,295 custom-
ers. In none of the cases did the breach amount to a critical viola-
tion.
We participate in various projects aimed at continually improving 
data privacy and data security. The following are just a few exam-
ples of our activities.
International cooperation for cybersecurity
We have been a member of the “Cyber Security Sharing & Analyt-
ics” (CSSA) association since 2014. The association provides a 
technical and organizational framework via which members’ 
experts can share sensitive information securely – and thereby 
interact with and support each other.
Knocking out botnets
Botnets are illicit networks of hijacked devices, created for various 
criminal purposes. The bigger a botnet is, the greater its cyberat-
tack impacts can be. To keep hackers from controlling hijacked 
devices within a botnet, Deutsche 
Telekom Security GmbH experts analyze the botnet’s structures 
and suppress communications with its controlling servers. Botnets 
have frequently hijacked devices of our customers. In over 670 
000 instances in 2023, we informed customers of botnet prob-
lems and helped them remove bots from their devices.
Uncovering stolen identities
Identity theft, hacked customer accounts, or malware on a smart-
phone: All these are not isolated events, but have now become a 
mass phenomenon – affecting all internet and mobile communi-
cation providers. To provide customers with the best possible 
protection, our fraud scouts (experts from the Deutsche Telekom 
security team) use a special application to search the entire world 
wide web for stolen identities, track down the sale of offered cus-
tomer accounts, and detect the latest malware. When they find 
such identities, we warn the relevant customers immediately and 
help them address the problem. If necessary, we block affected 
accounts. We also inform our customers in connection with other 
types of security incidents, such as “smishing” (sending of fraudu-
lent text messages (SMS)), malware infections of mobile devices, 
as well as viruses and spam. In 2023, we provided such warnings 
about 900 000 times. When our customers require personal assis-
tance, specially trained customer advisors are just an email 
(abuse@telekom.de) or phone call (0800 55 44 300) away.
Smart can also be safe and transparent
We not only want to comply with legal guidelines, we also want to 
actively ensure that our customers’ data is protected. To do so, we 
continue to enhance technical standards, and promote maximum 
transparency.
For example, with our “VoiceID” (“SprachID”) service, we do not 
save a customer’s voice file. Instead, we save a mathematical pat-
tern that is calculated from characteristics in the voice. The origi-
nal voice – and the customer behind it – cannot be identified via 
such a pattern. At the end of the reporting year, we suspended the 
service for the time being due to current developments in speech 
biometrics.
Strengthening trust in the cloud
Since 2021, T-Systems has been a member of the “EU Cloud Code 
of Conduct General Assembly” of SCOPE Europe, an association 
for the development of a common regulatory framework for the 
digital economy. With this membership, we express our commit-
ment to the “EU Cloud Code of Conduct,” the first cloud-services 
standard to be accepted by European data protection authorities. 
T-Systems now structures all of its cloud services accordingly. 
T-Systems and Google Cloud also signed a long-term cooperation 
agreement in 2021. The joint “T-Systems Sovereign Cloud pow-
ered by Google Cloud” combines since April 2022 the open-
source expertise of both providers, enabling customers to manage 
workloads in compliance with German and European regulatory 
requirements (GDPR and Schrems II). T-Systems continually moni-
tors compliance with all three aspects of digital sovereignty (data 
sovereignty, operational sovereignty and software sovereignty) so 
that enterprises from regulated industries can process their sensi-
tive data in the cloud in line with sovereignty requirements.

IT security & data protection 
A random sample of 50 000 Deutsche Telekom employees are sur-
veyed on the topics of data protection and data security aware-
ness every two years. The findings of the survey are used, for 
example, to determine the Security Awareness Index (SAI) and the 
Data Protection Award indicator. The indicators help us to review 
the effectiveness of our measures in the areas of IT security and 
data protection. The Data Protection Award indicator was last 
measured in 2022 and stood at 88 percent (excluding T-Mobile 
US). In 2023, security awareness index reached 80.6 (excluding 
T-Mobile US) of a maximum of 100 points (which is higher than 
for all other companies in the benchmark).
The Security Awareness Index measures our employees’ percep-
tion of IT security at Deutsche Telekom. The assessment is based 
on Deutsche Telekom employee answers on management aware-
ness of the topic, the security culture, the influence of security 
requirements on their own work, and their personal responsibility 
for and attitudes toward IT security. The index includes a scale 
from 0 to 100 – the higher the value, the higher IT security is rated 
at Deutsche Telekom.
T-Mobile US: data privacy and cybersecurity
T-Mobile US is committed to being a responsible steward of cus-
tomers’ personal data, and giving customers choices over how 
their information is collected and used. At T-Mobile US, data pri-
vacy focuses on five principles: trust, transparency, control, educa-
tion, and protection. The segment’s Privacy Center explains how 
customer data is used and how customers can manage it within 
the Privacy Dashboard. T-Mobile US provides annual data privacy 
training and year-round awareness programs so employees keep 
customer data confidential.
T-Mobile US continues make it even easier for customers to make 
choices about the use of their data with updated privacy tools and 
more choices. For example, the Privacy Center was updated to be 
mobile-friendly and simpler to navigate with a new Privacy Dash-
board. This provides customers the ability to choose how their 
data is used for analytics reporting, , and marketing, and highlights 
how customers can ask T-Mobile US about the personal data col-
lected.
Cybersecurity
T-Mobile US, like any other company, is not immune to criminal 
cyberattacks and is continuing to make substantial, multi-year 
investments in strengthening its cybersecurity program. As the 
cybersecurity landscape evolves, T-Mobile US continues to accel-
erate investments and upgrades to infrastructure in order to keep 
its network and digital systems safe. To further build on its robust 
cybersecurity oversight framework, T-Mobile US continues to 
improve its cybersecurity management, including cybersecurity 
technology, security protocols, monitoring and response opera-
tions, and compliance.
Through our interactive benchmarking tool, important facts and 
figures of our national companies can be analysed and compared.

Net value added
The increase in net value added, from EUR 64.9 billion to EUR 68.3 
billion, resulted primarily from significantly higher repayments to 
investors. Conversely, capital expenditures for intangible assets 
(primarily spectrum licenses) and our investments in the network 
build-out decreased in 2023. This decline in the year-on-year com-
parison resulted primarily from high capital investments for spec-
trum licenses in the United States and Europe operating seg-
ments, as well as high capital expenditures associated with our 
accelerated 5G network build-out and the integration of Sprint in 
the United States segment. Payments to employees also declined, 
due to factors such as a lower headcount in the United States, 
Germany, and Europe operating segments.
In contrast to the statement of income, the net value added only 
takes account of real payment flows. That means that deferred tax 
expenses and the accrual of provisions do not impact the net value 
added of the reporting period. Although these costs are deducted 
from net profit in the statement of income, they are not linked to 
any current payments to stakeholder   groups, as is the case with 
net value added. Outpayments in this respect are scheduled for 
the future and will only be accounted for in net value added in 
future years.

Revenue development
In 2023, Deutsche Telekom generated Group revenue of EUR 112 
billion. The decrease of around EUR 2.4 billion constitutes a year-
on-year drop of around 2 percent. The international share of Group 
revenue increased by 0.96 percentage points to 76.4 percent.

Revenue per employee
Revenue per employee increased by around 0.9 percent to EUR 
547 000 in 2023. In Germany, the revenues per employee 
increased by about 6 percent. This contrasted with a slight 
decrease by 0.8 percent internationally.
Personnel costs and personnel cost ratio
Personnel costs are defined as basic personnel costs (wages, s
alaries) plus ancillary personnel costs (social costs). This figure is 
adjusted for special factors in conjunction with staff restructuring 
measures (specific staff reduction instruments). The personnel 
cost ratio represents personnel costs as a proportion of revenue. 
The development of this ratio serves as a benchmark for company 
business. In the Group, the personnel cost ratio fell again this year. 
Following a record low last year, the ratio fell again this year by 
0.2 percentage points to 15.6 percent. This is primarily a result of 
the reduced headcount.
The disadvantage of the personnel cost ratio is that it ignores 
external personnel costs. Therefore the total workforce costs ratio 
is more meaningful for the management of personnel costs at 
Deutsche Telekom.
HR EBITDA (Ratio)
The “HR EBITDA” of Deutsche Telekom Group (excluding T-Mobile 
US) puts into ratio the calculated earnings per employee with the 
investments in training per employee.

Human Capital ROI
The “Human Capital Return on Invest (ROI)” illustrates the compa-
ny’s return on investment in human capital by building a ratio 
between revenue, OPEX and the internal workforce costs  (IWC).
Total Workforce Costs
Total Workforce Ratio
Total workforce management allows HR to be managed in a holis-
tic manner, enabling qualitative and quantitative personnel plan-
ning over the long term. The total workforce ratio describes the 
relationship between all personnel expenditure and revenue. This 
means: if the ratio has fallen in comparison with the previous year, 
either revenue has remained constant while total workforce costs 
have gone down, or revenue has increased with stable total work-
force costs.
Deutsche Telekom’s total workforce ratio improved again in 2023. 
The adjusted ratio for the Group as a whole dropped by 0.4 per-
centage points in 2023 compared with the previous year. While 
total revenue decreased by 2.1 percent (EUR 2.4 billion) in 2023, 
total workforce costs declined by around 3.9 percent year-on-year.

Climate strategy
We see ourselves as a responsible company and have made that a 
core element of our Group strategy. Our Corporate Responsibility 
strategy is derived from this. We identified four particular focal 
points where we aim to lead the way, two of which are related to 
the environment:

Our strict commitment to climate-neutral business practices

Our determined efforts to ensure our products and services are 
compatible with the principle of circularity
More information about our focus topics is available in the relevant 
section of the strategy chapter.
To support the Group’s climate strategy and achieve the Group’s 
ambitious targets, the national companies have developed and 
implemented their own climate change mitigation strategies, con-
cepts, and measures.
Our integrated climate strategy is based on four pillars: emissions 
from the value chain; renewable energy; energy efficiency; and 
enablement (positive climate change mitigation effects for our 
customers). We have defined objectives and/or key performance 
indicators for each of the four pillars.
Emissions from the value chain
We record all direct and indirect emissions using the globally rec-
ognized Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. As of 2021, all of the 
electricity we use comes from renewable energy. This has enabled 
us to reduce the emissions generated to zero (see “Renewable 
energy”). Additionally, we are modernizing our network to make it 
twice as energy efficient (see “Energy efficiency”). We are also tak-
ing measures to reduce emissions tied to the use of gas or oil. For 
example, we are transitioning to e-mobility and are carrying out 
facility-space consolidations. This has enabled us to significantly 
reduce emissions and contribute to our goal of climate neutrality 
by 2025 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
Indirect emissions from the upstream and downstream value chain 
(Scope 3 emissions) pose the greatest challenge. Our goal is to 
become entirely climate neutral by 2040 at the latest. We consult 
closely with our suppliers in order to reduce the emissions gener-
ated during production, and to have products manufactured that 
are energy-efficient in their utilization phases.
Renewable energy
Since 2021, we have been drawing all of our electricity from 
renewable sources, having converted the entire Deutsche Telekom 
network, throughout the spectrum from mobile communications 
to high-speed DSL, to use renewables-only power. We are scaling 
up our in-house generation activities and concluding power pur-
chase agreements (PPAs) with a view to reducing our reliance on 
the electricity grid. A PPA is a long-term electricity supply con-
tract. For us, this additionally means that the electricity supplied 
always comes from renewable sources. We aim to meet 50 per-
cent of our energy needs through PPAs by 2025. In Germany, PPAs 
already account for over 26 percent of the power we use. As of the 
end of 2023, 32.5 percent of the power used throughout the 
Group was obtained via PPAs. In 2020, we published a guide for 
the Deutsche Telekom Group, the purpose of which is to support 
our national companies in choosing the ideal solution for their indi-
vidual needs by providing information on the various options they 
have available for the purchase of green electricity.
Energy efficiency
The rapid growth in data traffic and the resultant need for network 
expansion must not also lead to a corresponding rise in energy 
consumption. This is why we have committed to doubling our 
energy efficiency in Germany and Europe by 2024, relative to 
2020 levels. This will involve producing more data while using a 
similar or far lower volume of energy. Two key means of reducing 
our energy consumption are network modernization and the 
phasing-out of old technologies.

One example of this has seen us migrate our entire network infra-
structure to IP technology. In addition, we are working to concen-
trate data traffic on a small number of data centers that are espe-
cially efficient. The PUE metric serves as one indicator for energy-
efficiency enhancements in our data centers. We determine this 
metric using the method recommended by the EN50600 standard 
for data centers. In order to measure our progress, we also use the 
key performance indicators (KPIs) “Energy Intensity” and “Carbon 
Intensity”.
Enablement: Helping our customers protect the climates
Many of our products and services provide sustainability advan-
tages. They can help reduce energy consumption and carbon 
emissions, improve healthcare and make logistics more efficient. 
In addition to our own carbon footprint, we also calculate the posi-
tive carbon effects facilitated for our customers through using our 
products and solutions. We assess both variables in relation to the 
Enablement Factor ESG KPI. This helps us evaluate our overall per-
formance in relation to climate protection.
By offering increasingly sustainable products and solutions and by 
reducing our own emissions, we aim to consistently keep the ena-
blement factor well above 1.0 in order to make a positive contribu-
tion to climate protection.

Our climate targets
We are helping to mitigate climate change, and contributing to 
compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Our current climate 
targets were adopted by the Board of Management in 2019 and 
have applied since 2020. Our ambitions were raised again in 2021. 
In March 2023, we replaced our previous science-based target on 
our journey towards climate neutrality with more ambitious interim 
and final goals, which have now been confirmed by the Science 
Based Target initiative (SBTi). Energy consumption and CO₂ emis-
sions have been a factor in the Board of Management’s remunera-
tion since 2021. Achieving these KPIs has also been a factor in the 
remuneration of executives in Germany and Europe and employ-
ees not covered by collective agreements in Germany since 2022.
Our climate goals are:

We achieved 100 percent electricity from renewable energy 
sources across the Group (Scope 2, market-based method) 
at the end of 2021.

We are aiming to reach climate neutrality across the Company 
by the end of 2025 (Scope 1 and 2). As we cannot avoid all 
emissions, we intend to offset around 5 percent of the remain-
ing emissions through compensatory measures.

As a new interim goal on our journey towards climate neutrality 
along the entire value chain, we have committed to reducing 
CO₂ emissions across Scopes 1–3 by 55 percent in absolute 
terms by 2030 compared with 2020. This interim goal is con-
siderably more ambitious than our previous goal, which was to 
reduce Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent per customer (com-
pared with 2017) by 2030. As a result of our systematic efforts 
to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, the majority 
(over 98%) of our carbon footprint now occurs through the pro-
duction and use of our products. We maintain a close dialog 
with our suppliers in order to reduce the emissions generated 
during production and to ensure the products manufactured 
consume less energy during the utilization phase.

We want to reach net zero by 2040 across all three scopes 
along the entire value chain. We want to cut emissions by at 
least 90 percent, so that we only need to offset up to 10 per-
cent. This goal is also in line with the targets set out by the 
European Green Digital Coalition, of which Deutsche Telekom 
is a founding member.
As a general principle, where there are CO₂ emissions that we can-
not avoid by using renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, 
or agreeing climate goals with suppliers, for example, we will off-
set these using compensatory measures that mean they are 
removed from the atmosphere in the long term, such as through 
natural sinks in which natural ecosystems absorb greenhouse 
gases from the atmosphere. We have set ourselves the quality 
requirement for offsetting that we only use high- quality removal 
projects in accordance with Oxford category IV and V, i.e., the 
removal of carbon through short- and long-term storage.
We developed our Group-wide climate goals in line with the cur-
rent scientific and political conditions. For the current targets, the 
SBTi once again confirmed in the reporting year that our climate 
protection goals contribute to compliance with the Paris Agree-
ment even under its stricter new guidelines. We developed a Cli-
mate Target Transition Plan in 2023 that we will detail further in 
2024 in accordance with the future requirements of the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The plan enables us to 
manage and monitor the success of our reduction measures inter-
nally. It also helps us to inform our stakeholders about our journey 
towards net zero emissions. The SBTi also gave a positive assess-
ment of the targets set by our subsidiaries in the United States and 
Hungary. The national companies are taking different steps to 
achieve these targets. These include power purchase agreements 
(PPAs) for procuring electricity from specific sustainable sources, 
such as wind and solar power. At the end of 2023, we were obtain-
ing 32.5 percent of our electricity through these PPAs (prior year: 
27.7%). By 2025, we intend to increase this percentage in Europe 
to 50 percent of our power consumption. Our aim is to actively 
support the sustainable production of electricity from renewal 
energies

Impact assessment for our materiality analysis
Greenhouse gas emissions are associated with a detrimental 
impact on humans and the environment. For this reason, we have 
identified climate change mitigation as a key topic throughout the 
value chain in the impact assessment conducted as part of our 
materiality analysis. Analysis of the criteria “probability of occur-
rence” and “severity” has revealed that significant greenhouse  
gas emissions could be generated in the upstream value chain in 
particular (during raw material extraction and supplier activities), 
as well as in the downstream value chain, which comprises the  
utilization, disposal and recycling of products.

Climate Target Transition Plan: our journey towards net zero
In the reporting year we started developing a Climate Target Tran-
sition Plan. The plan will also enable us to manage and monitor the 
success of our reduction measures internally. The transition plan 
shown here is an initial, simplified illustration that we use it to 
inform our stakeholders about our journey towards net zero emis-
sions.
The Transition Plan is based on greenhouse gas calculations from 
previous years, as well as our short-, medium- and long-term cli-
mate targets. These targets include achieving climate neutrality by 
2025 (Scopes 1 and 2), as part of which around 5 percent of una-
voidable remaining emissions will be offset through high-quality 
neutralization projects (removal projects). We are also aiming for a 
reduction in total emissions by 55 percent in absolute terms by 
2030 compared to 2020, and achieving net zero emissions by 
2040. By this time, we will have reduced at least 90 percent of 
emissions in absolute terms and offset the remainder through 
high-quality neutralization projects (removal). The climate transi-
tion plan that we want to deploy to put our climate goals into prac-
tice particularly focuses on core levers such as the power con-
sumption of our networks, fuel consumption in our fleet, thermal 
energy consumption in buildings, reducing emissions in supplier 
production processes, and increasing product efficiency in the  
utilization phase.
Practical measures to reducing emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 
include:
	
Continued procurement of electricity from renewable sources, 
with a focus on expanding power purchase agreements (PPAs) 
and our own generation
	
Energy efficiency measures by usinge more efficient and 
decommissioning obsolete technologies
	
Space reduction and modernization in buildings
	
Electrification and reduction of our vehicle fleet
	
Progressive electrification of heating with heat pumps.
In line with our sustainable procurement strategy a Group-wide 
task force is currently managing an initiative aimed at reducing 
emissions at supplier and product level. This task force plays a  
key role in coordinating efforts across all segments and ensures a 
consistent approach is taken to reducing emissions.
Other measures in a Scope 3 context include:
	
extended product life
	
Improving the energy efficiency of devices sold
	
Increasing the proportion of renewable energy used by  
suppliers and customers
	
sustainable procurement of materials and packaging
In this context, we intend to expand financial planning for imple-
menting the envisaged emission reduction measures. The energy 
data and the Scope 1 and 2 emissions were integrated into the 
financial planning processes in 2022, with specific investment 
funding allocated to the reduction measures. Beginning in 2024, 
we will also integrate Scope 3 emissions into this predictive plan-
ning process. The details of the Climate Target Transition Plan will 
be fleshed out in close cooperation with the various segments and 
departments within Deutsche Telekom. The transition plan is 
based on current information, knowledge and indications and is 
regularly reviewed, developed and updated.
Our approach to measuring our progress with climate change 
mitigation
We calculate our emissions for our climate targets along the entire 
value chain, taking account of our own energy consumption 
(Scopes 1 and 2) and that of our upstream and downstream activi-
ties along our value chain (Scope 3), based on the method of the 
internationally recognized Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. We 
have broken down all our CO₂e emissions in detail here.
Indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities along 
our value chain make up the majority of our total emissions. By 
recording them, we lay the foundation for reducing emissions in 
our value chains through targeted measures together with our  
suppliers and customers.
The emissions data enter into various KPIs that we use to measure 
our contribution to climate change mitigation and make our pro-
gress transparent. The Carbon Intensity and Energy Intensity KPIs 
are used to analyze the relationship between our CO₂e emissions 
or energy use and the transmitted data volume. Using data volume 
as a reference parameter makes it possible to create a direct link 
to the performance of our networks. We draw on the additional 
Enablement Factor and Renewable Energies KPIs to make our  
climate change mitigation activities more transparent and easier 
to manage.
The Board of Management is informed each year in detail by the 
Group Corporate Responsibility (GCR) unit about the status of the 
programs we have implemented to achieve our climate targets.

Climate target achievement 
At the end of the year, our progress toward our targets was as had 
been forecast.
Electricity from 100 percent renewable energies
Since 2021, 100 percent of the electricity we use, Group-wide, has 
been sourced from renewable energies (Scope 2).
Climate neutrality by 2025 (Scopes 1 and 2)
Our targets call for us to achieve climate neutrality in the company 
by late 2025 (Scopes 1 and 2). We intend to offset around 5 per-
cent of the remaining emissions through compensatory measures.
In the year under review, we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 95 percent with respect to their 2017 levels.
Climate neutrality by 2040
We want to be climate neutral (net zero) in all three Scopes by 
2040 at the latest, so that we no longer have any carbon footprint 
at all. To date, we have achieved 23 percent of this ambitious tar-
get. To allow us to better monitor our progress, in 2023 we 
replaced our interim target of reducing Scope 3 emissions by 
25 percent per customer (compared with 2017) by 2030 with a 
more ambitious interim target: by 2030, we want to have achieved 
an absolute reduction of 55 percent in Scope 1 to 3 emissions 
(compared with 2020).

Orientation to the TCFD’s recommendations
The “Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)” 
was established at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Con-
ference in Paris. Its aim is to develop voluntary, consistent climate-
related financial risk disclosures. In 2017, the TCFD published spe-
cific recommendations for putting these disclosures into practice, 
recommendations that companies can use as a guideline to inform 
investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders about the risks 
climate change presents for their business model. The final stand-
ard of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) was published concurrently with the recommendations for 
the climate sector in 2023. It concerns nature-related opportuni-
ties and risks. You can find details on Deutsche Telekom’s biodiver-
sity work here.
We welcome the aims tied to the TCFD, and we are moving for-
ward with TCFD-based reporting relative to those aims. As is 
already becoming increasingly clear, the physical risks posed by 
climate change include extreme weather events. In addition, tran-
sitional risks, such as the trend in carbon prices, are increasingly 
affecting political debate in this context. This directly influences 
our operations and our stakeholders. The risks applying to the 
continuation of our operations are analyzed, and those risks are 
operationally managed by our business units. In addition, we eval-
uate internally how reporting on climate-related financial risks and 
opportunities can be aligned with the TCFD’s recommendations. 
Ideally, such alignment would build on existing approaches for 
strategy, controlling, and risk management.

a) Describe the supervision of the 
Board of Management relative to 
climate-related opportunities and 
risks.
	 Since sustainability and climate change are important issues for Deutsche Telekom, efforts to address these issues 
are managed at the top level of the company. Our CEO, along with the other members of the Deutsche Telekom 
Board of Management, has responsibility for addressing climate-related issues throughout the entire Group. This ext-
ends to our climate strategy, our climate targets, and our climate-related opportunities and risks.
	 The Deutsche Telekom Board of Management is informed annually concerning the current status of the company’s 
climate target achievement and regarding other company-related climate issues. Climate indicators (ESG KPI img 
“Energy Intensity,” ESG KPI “Carbon Intensity”) also form part of the quarterly report submitted to the Board of 
Management. As of January 1, 2022, the CEO has this responsibility.
	 In addition, Deutsche Telekom’s risk management team reports to the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee regar-
ding ESG risks and opportunities on a quarterly basis. When unforeseen risks occur outside of the regular-reporting 
framework, they are flagged on an ad hoc basis, and reported to the company’s Board of Management and Supervi-
sory Board. The key risks for the Deutsche Telekom Group are reported in our annual report.

a) Describe the climate-related 
opportunities and risks that the 
organization has identified for the 
short, medium and long terms.
	 The central climate-related risks include the possible failure of the network infrastructure, as a result of damage to 
the secondary infrastructure (such as through power failures) or failures of cooling systems. Another risk consists of 
possible network damage or failure as a result of network-infrastructure damage resulting from extreme weather 
events or changes in climate conditions. While these risks can result in short, medium and long-term damage, 
climate-related physical hazards are expected to increase in the future.
	 The primary transitional risks mentioned include carbon prices and regulation of products and services – for 
example, via increased energy-efficiency requirements. In addition, there is a risk of negative stakeholder img 
feedback and reputational damage. For the most part, the time horizon for these risks is seen as medium-term to 
long-term.
	 With regard to opportunities, we have identified our increasing use of energy-efficient technologies, and growing 
demand for climate-friendly products and services, as significant climate-related opportunities.

	 CDP questionnaire, C.3 Risks and Opportunities 
b) Describe the impacts of climate-
related opportunities and risks on the 
organization’s business operations, 
strategy and financial planning.
	 Climate-related opportunities and risks have affected our business operations in many different ways. Energy 
efficiency, for example, is of great importance for Deutsche Telekom, since the network’s energy consumption 
strongly affects operational costs. It is also important in light of the Group’s strategic approach to climate change 
mitigation and of the growing concerns and expectations of our stakeholders. Consequently, we are now aiming to 
at least keep our annual energy consumption stable, despite the anticipated increase in data consumption. In 
Germany and Europe, we have set ourselves the target of doubling the energy efficiency of our networks by 2024 
(compared with 2020) and thus reducing energy consumption further. Cutting energy consumption and reducing 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions img have each been declared as remuneration-related targets, with a 50-percent 
weighting in each case.
	 For this reason, we have launched a number of programs for improving energy efficiency at our locations and in our 
operations. We have studied our value chain in order to identify potential for enhancing resource efficiency and 
reducing CO2 emissions. We have also identified central action areas for future measures that are expected to make 
our company’s operations more sustainable overall. The measures include, for example, labeling of products that are 
especially sustainable.

	 Climate strategy
	 CDP questionnaire, C.3.3 and 3.4 Business Strategy
c) Describe the resilience of the 
organization’s strategy, taking account 
of various climate-related scenarios, 
including a scenario with 2°C or less of 
warming.
	 We updated and expanded our physical climate risk assessment in 2023, analyzing physical climate risks at selected 
Deutsche Telekom locations in Germany and internationally. These locations included mobile and fixed-network 
sites and data centers whose functionality gives them a significant influence over our business operations. Thus, 
more than 2 500 locations were analyzed in light of different climate scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC): a business-as-usual scenario (RCP 4.5/SSP2-4.5), with a global temperature increase of 
more than two degrees, and a four-degree scenario (RCP 8.5/SSP5-8.5). The RCP-2.6/SSP1-2.6 scenario, which 
entails a temperate increase of less than two degrees, was also available. Further details are provided here in the CR 
report.
	 Currently, we are extending our scenario analysis to additional international locations, with a view to a full 
assessment of our organization’s long-term resilience. In a first step in this effort, we brought several of the largest 
national companies into the process: the OTE Group in Greece, Magyar Telekom in Hungary, and Hrvatski Telekom in 
Croatia. With the help of comprehensive materiality assessments, the companies’ key locations in this context were 
identified and analyzed in terms of the physical risks they face. The same physical risks and climate scenarios are 
applied in all cases throughout the Group.
	 In addition, the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE Scenario), which is a 
1.5-degree scenario, was applied with regard to transitory opportunities and risks. That scenario considers political, 
social and technological changes that the transition to a low-carbon economy would bring and that would lead to 
various risks and opportunities for our company. The Net Zero Scenario has thus supplanted the Sustainable 
Development Scenario (SDS) in this role.

a) Describe the organization’s 
processes for identifying and 
evaluating climate-related risks.
	 In 2023, we updated our climate risk analysis once again: within the framework of various workshops with experts 
from the areas of technology, procurement, and strategy and risk management, we defined the main climate-related 
opportunities and risks and began weighting them. In the process, we considered the consequences, for our business 
operations, that could result from the physical impacts of progressing climate change. In addition, we analyzed the 
impacts resulting from political, technological, and social developments tied to the transition toward a low-carbon 
economy that has been initiated. Further details are provided here in the CR report.
	 The process for identifying the opportunities and risks tied to climate change comprises the following:
	 Screening of media and NGO publications
	 Actively supporting the work of various industry associations that are studying the issue of climate change, such 
as GeSI, econsense, Stiftung 2°, ICC, GSMA, and ETNO
	 Initiating and participating in stakeholder dialogs on the issue of climate change
	 Analyzing responses to the CDP img supply-chain program
	 Analyzing relevant inquiries of rating agencies, such as S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA), 
CDP, Sustainalytics, etc. 
	 The process for evaluating the opportunities and risks tied to climate change comprises the following:
	 Identifying and quantifying the important trends
	 Calculating the impacts on operations
	 Analyzing the impacts on the value chain • We financially quantified our transitory risks in 2022 in order to verify 
the qualitative materiality analysis from the workshops. The quantification for a number of risks was already pub-
lished in the CDP questionnaire 2022. The resulting financial impacts will then be taken into account in the 
company’s planning. Management instruments for taking account of climate change mitigation in investment 
decisions are regularly reviewed for feasibility and benefit (instruments such as an internal carbon price, for 
example).
b) Describe the organization’s 
processes for addressing the climate-
related risks.
	 On an expert-knowledge basis, opportunities and risks are evaluated in terms of their potential financial impacts (on 
EBITDA-AL) and of the probability of their occurrence. Where opportunities and risks cannot be quantified, their 
potential impacts can be reported in qualitative terms. Once risks and opportunities have been identified, they are 
analyzed and evaluated, in detail, in terms of the probability of their occurrence and their potential financial impacts. 
This can be done with the help of a scenario analysis, for example. Then we decide what concrete measures need to 
be taken in order to reduce the risks or exploit the opportunities. As a next step, in each case the relevant risk owner 
implements the measures, and monitors and evaluates their effectiveness. As necessary, the above steps are 
repeated and adjusted in light of the latest pertinent developments and decisions.

	 CDP questionnaire, C2.2 Risks and Opportunities – Description of processes
c) Describe how the processes 
for identification, evaluation, and 
management of climate-related risks 
are integrated within the organization’s 
risk management.
	 Our processes for identification and evaluation of climate-related risks are completely integrated within company-
wide, multidisciplinary processes for risk identification, evaluation, and management. On a quarterly basis, risks and 
opportunities (with impacts of over EUR 100 million on EBITDA) are identified via a Group-wide risk management 
process (RMP) that has been developed, and is managed, by the Group Risk Governance department. The RMP 
provides methods and systems for identification and evaluation of risks and opportunities. The responsibility for 
reporting on Group risks and opportunities is divided among the relevant business units; consequently, GCR is 
responsible for climate risks. Further information on the risk process is available in our annual report.
The risk area also works closely with GCR to identify material climate-related opportunities and risks, and participates 
in internal workshops.

Progress in implementation of the TCFD recommendations
In 2020, we carried out a gap analysis to determine the extent to 
which our measures already conform to the TCFD recommenda-
tions (see here). During the year under review, we supplemented 
the gap analysis and, operating within the framework of the EU 
Taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD, ESRS E1), incorporated other requirements into the corpo-
rate climate risk analysis.
In 2023, we again updated our climate risk analysis: within the 
framework of various workshops with experts from the areas of 
technology, procurement, and strategy and risk management, we 
defined the main climate-related opportunities and risks and 
began weighting them. In the process, we considered the conse-
quences, for our business operations, that could result from the 
physical impacts of progressing climate change. In addition, we 
analyzed the potential impacts resulting from political, technologi-
cal, and social developments tied to the transition toward a low-
carbon economy that has been initiated. The analysis also involves 
a financial quantification of transitory risks.
The important climate-related risks include possible network-infra-
structure failures as a result of damage to secondary infrastructure 
(involving power failures, for example) or failures of cooling sys-
tems. Another risk consists of possible network damage or failure 
as a result of network-infrastructure damage due to extreme 
weather events or changes in climate conditions.
The important climate-related opportunities we have identified 
include the increasing use of energy-efficient technologies (in net-
work operations, for example), and growing demand for climate-
friendly products and services.
In a next step, we analyzed selected Deutsche Telekom locations in 
Germany, Hungary, and Croatia with regard to their physical cli-
mate risks. These locations included mobile and fixed-network 
sites and data centers whose functionality gives them a significant 
influence over our business operations. We analyzed over 2 500 
locations in total, using the Climate Change Edition of reinsurance 
company Munich Re’s Location Risk Intelligence software. The 
analysis covers nine indexes (see graphic). We considered the risks 
for the various locations in light of two climate scenarios of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): a business-
as-usual scenario (RCP 4.5/SSP2-4.5), with a global temperature 
increase of more two degrees, and a four-degree scenario (RCP 
8.5/SSP5-8.5). In addition to studying the climate scenarios, we 
looked at risks in various time frames: currently, for the years 2030, 
2040, 2050 and for 2100.
The following graphic shows a simplified excerpt of the results: the 
risks for the year 2050, in keeping with the four-degree scenario:
The scenario analysis shows that only minor physical risks apply 
for the majority of the company’s locations in Germany. We antici-
pate moderate risks, due, for instance, to heat, for our Croatian and 
Hungarian locations. We are prepared for the impacts of physical 
risks, such as changes in precipitation patterns and extreme 
weather variability. As shown by examples such as the fierce forest 
fires in Greece 2023, and the disastrous floods of July 2021, 
extreme weather events are already capable of causing local dam-
age to our telecommunications infrastructure. Consequently, our 
risk management is based on multiple pillars – we structure 
Deutsche Telekom’s telecommunications networks with built-in 
resiliency. For example, we use ring structures to ensure that fail-
ures of individual network components do not affect the services 
we provide for our customers. For most of our critical locations, 
we use uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems incorporating 
batteries and mobile and stationary diesel generators. Such 
systems can normally provide emergency power for several hours 
in the event of power failures. Our crisis management also helps 
with rapid recovery in the event of disruptions. The risks of dam-
age to buildings and to Deutsche Telekom’s network infrastructure 
are covered by insurance policies. Further information is available 
in the chapters “Addressing climate risks” and “Risk and opportu-
nity management”.
The analysis has been extended to other countries and we are 
currently working on a full-scale international roll-out.

The continuing refinement of our risk management, in keeping 
with the TCFD requirements, is also important from a regulatory 
perspective, especially in light of the EU Taxonomy guidelines. The 
criteria for the environmental goal “Climate change adaptation” 
require – as does the TCFD – companies to study physical climate 
risks and to be aware of the potential impacts on their business 
activities. With our TCFD process, we have laid the foundation for 
the climate risk analysis that is needed to fulfill the taxonomy crite-
ria. More information on the implementation and the results of the 
taxonomy-aligned climate risk analysis can be found in the “EU

Addressing climate risks
In the context of our integrated climate strategy, we determine cli-
mate-related risks and opportunities for us as a company and for 
our stakeholders. Our Board of Management is informed quarterly 
about current climate risks in a Group Risk Report. You will find 
more information on risk management in the “Risk and opportunity 
management” section of our annual report.
Physical risks
Extreme weather conditions as a consequence of climate change 
will have a negative impact on our business processes and will 
inevitably lead to incidents or even network outages. Among the 
effects of such breakdowns is their massive impact on the man-
agement of rescue operations, for example, sometimes even ren-
dering such emergency efforts entirely impossible. In order to be 
able to react appropriately in these cases, we have defined the 
necessary responsibilities, processes, and measures in our internal 
“Group Policy on Continuity and Situation Management.” Addition-
ally, the policy outlines how to handle emergency and crisis situa-
tions like floods.
We also take possible consequences of climate change into 
account when planning our future business activities. For example, 
our network infrastructure is set up to be better protected from 
storm conditions, changes in temperature, and high winds and 
keep mobile supply infrastructure on hand for emergencies.
Financial risks
Climate change also carries financial risks, whether from levies on 
CO₂ emissions or through an increase in energy costs. Our contri-
bution to the mitigation of these risks includes measuring our own 
energy efficiency and developing measures for improvement. To 
prevent infrastructure failure due to extreme weather events, addi-
tional investment in a more robust infrastructure might be neces-
sary.
Prevention
We also help our customers reduce their own carbon footprint, 
thus helping to mitigate climate change, by providing them with 
innovative solutions. Examples include projects in the area of 
sustainable urban development and mobility, and also a real-time 
solution for agriculture (precise positioning). It can be used, for 
instance, to correct GPS data that is often too inaccurate for 
agricultural purposes and transmit precise location data in real 
time – using 5G mobile technology. Our low-threshold, compara-
tively inexpensive solution helps farmers deploy their machinery 
with greater precision, to reduce emissions, dose fertilizer and 
seeds more accurately, and increase their yields. That way we can 
also make an indirect contribution to achieving the second sus-
tainable development goal (SDG) of “zero hunger.”
We also help our customers deal with the adverse effects of cli-
mate change (adaptation). In the event of an imminent catastro-
phe, our infrastructure can be used, for example, to send alerts via 
early warning apps. Climate change adaptation is part of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation, which we discuss here.

The mission of T-Mobile US is to be the best in the world at con-
necting customers to their world by enabling them to stay digitally 
connected with the help of its products and services. At the same 
time, the company recognizes that providing connectivity to its 
customers also has an impact on the environment. By taking bold 
steps to reduce its environmental footprint, T-Mobile US can help 
create a more sustainable future for everyone. Mobilizing network, 
people, and partnerships to support a thriving planet is a key focus 
area of the ESG approach adopted by T-Mobile US.
A science-based approach to net-zero
In 2023, T-Mobile US announced its commitment to achieve net-
zero emissions across its entire carbon footprint by 2040. This 
makes it the first in the US telecommunications industry to set a 
science-based commitment to become net-zero. The target has 
been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) using 
its Net-Zero Standard and includes near-term and long-term com-
mitments to bring about a 55 percent reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 
3 emissions by 2030 and a 90 percent reduction by 2040, from a 
2020 base year.
The Climate Pledge
Knowing that collaboration is key to tackling climate change, 
T-Mobile US also signed onto The Climate Pledge, a cross-sector 
community of companies and organizations working together to 
solve the challenges of cutting global carbon emissions for a sus-
tainable future. The Climate Pledge was co-founded by Amazon 
and Global Optimism in 2019 to establish a collective commit-
ment to achieve net-zero emissions ten years ahead of The Paris 
Agreement. Organizations signing up also agree to measure and 
report greenhouse gas emission on a regular basis.
Climate risk and oversight
The network resilience strategy pursued by T-Mobile US evaluates 
technology disruptions and climate-related impacts to mitigate 
risk. We track progress on network resiliency and evaluate our net-
work sites for vulnerabilities to environmental change.

ESG KPI “Carbon Intensity” DT Group
This year sees us reporting our carbon intensity on the basis of two 
different indicators: data volume and revenue. Both KPIs take into 
account total CO₂e emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) for all energy 
sources – electricity, fuel, gas and district heating.
We began to report our CO₂e emissions in proportion to our man-
aged data volumes in 2016 in the form of the ESG KPI “Carbon 
Intensity” – data volume. Using data volume as a reference param-
eter makes it possible to create a direct link to the performance of 
our networks. The data volume is composed of the transmitted IP 
data volumes (including Voice over IP, Internet, IP-TV).
Our ambition in this connection: reduce the KPI
There has been a significant reduction in carbon intensity, relative 
to data volume, since 2021.
In preparation for future reporting in accordance with the CSRD, 
this year we are not only reporting carbon intensity relative to data 
volume, but also carbon intensity relative to revenue. This allows 
us to measure our progress in reducing our CO₂e emissions within 
the context of our economic performance.
To enable better comparison between this indicator and the ratio 
of carbon intensity to data volume, we slightly modified the calcu-
lation methodology for the Group’s values in 2023. Starting in 
2023, we now include the CO₂e emissions (Scope 1 and 2) of all 
segments, including those outside our fixed-network and mobile 
business segments (such as cloud business).

Total CO2e emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) in the DT Group
We present our Scope 1 to 3 greenhouse gas emissions uniformly 
so that they can be compared with each other. To that end, emis-
sions are converted into metric kilotons of CO₂ equivalents (CO₂e). 
In addition to CO₂, we also consider CH4 and N2O, and are working 
on integrating HFCs (refrigerants) into the calculation as well. Bio-
genic CO₂ emissions were not recorded separately for the year 
2023, as they only occur to a small extent. We break down the 
emissions that occur along our value chain; this gives us an over-
view of where in the value chain the majority of them occur.
By making a complete transition to electricity from renewable 
energies in 2021, we were able to considerably reduce our Scope 
2 emissions. In 2023, market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
throughout the Group amounted to around 217 000 metric tons of 
CO₂e, or about 6.9 percent lower than in the previous year.

In 2023, Scope 3 emissions decreased in comparison with the pre-
vious year – from 11.8 million metric tons to around 10.5 million 
metric tons of CO₂e. This reduction partly resulted from methodol-
ogy adjustments for upstream activities in particular. Most of the 
Scope 3 emissions resulted from the manufacture of products and 
components (in particular devices and network technology), and 
from the use of our products and services (for example, sold or 
rented fixed-line and mobile phones, routers, and media receivers) 
by our customers. Some 2 million metric tons of CO₂e are addition-
ally generated during the utilization phase of our solutions by 
devices that our customers purchase from third parties and not 
from Deutsche Telekom. As we have only a negligible influence on 
these devices and hence on their energy consumption and emis-
sions, we have reported these emissions separately since 2022. 
Since 2022, emissions caused by visits to Telekom Shops by our 
customers have also been included for Germany and Europe.
Currently, we are studying various factors that will influence the 
quantities of our future emissions (Scopes 1 to 3). For example, our 
suppliers’ climate-protection efforts are having a positive impact. 
In addition, lower power mix factors, and improved energy effi-
ciency in the devices used in connection with our products and 
services, can be expected to lower emissions. The fall in emissions 
from our employees commuting to and from work also has a small 
positive impact. On the other hand, it is possible that higher num-
bers of (new) devices used in connection with our products and 
services will increase emissions.

Total CO₂e emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) in segments
In addition to discussing the emissions of the Group as a whole, 
we provide separate information on Scope 1 to 3 emissions for the 
segments. We present our Scope 1 to 3 greenhouse gas emissions 
in a consistent manner, so that they can be compared with each 
other. To that end, emissions are converted into metric kilotons of 
CO₂ equivalents (CO₂e). In addition to CO₂, we also consider CH4 
and N2O, and are working on integrating HFCs (refrigerants) into 
the calculation as well. Biogenic CO₂ emissions were not recorded 
separately for the year 2022, as they only occur to a small extent. 
We also break down emissions along our value chain. This gives us 
an overview of where most of the emissions are produced in the 
chain.
In all segments, most of these emissions occurred in the upstream 
value chain, as well as in our customers’ use of our products and 
services. In those emissions, we also include emissions resulting 
from the use of our services by our customers’ own devices, such 
as laptops or tablet computers.
Further details about all segments are provided here in the bench-
marking tool.
Germany segment
In 2023, market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the Germany 
segment amounted to around 85 000 metric tons of CO₂e. The 
Scope 3 emissions were 2.1 million metric tons of CO₂e, thereby

4-year trend: total CO2e emissions (Scopes 1 to 2) in the DT 
Group
Our CO₂ emissions are largely driven by fleet fuels, fossil fuels and 
district heating. The table below contains detailed information 
about the Group numbers for the Scope 2 emissions resulting from 
our electricity consumption. We differentiate between the market-
based and location-based methods, thereby adhering to the GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Market-based and location-based 
emissions are displayed in CO₂ equivalents. This conversion was 
undertaken to facilitate transparent comparison between Scope 1 
to 3 emissions and to align consistently with the requirements of 
the Science Based Targets initiative to which the new goal is also 
oriented.
The market-based approach is the main method used in our 
reporting. This method is used to calculate emissions with a spe-
cific emissions factor (provider factor) per DT company. This factor 
depends on a company’s actual energy procurement (electricity 
mix); procuring renewable energy (direct purchase, certificates) 
reduces emissions.a)
In contrast to the market-based method, with the location-based 
method the emissions factors for the respective country (the 
country mix factor) of the International Energy Agency (IEA) are 
used across the board. A company’s actual energy procurement 
(electricity mix), including the procurement of renewable energy 
that goes beyond the country mix, is therefore not taken into 
account.
Change compared to 2020: The Scope 2 emissions calculated 
according to the market-based method are about 99 percent 
lower than in 2020. The marked difference between the 2023 and 
2020 figures is a result of the Group-wide use of green electricity, 
PPAs, and guarantees of origin. Since 2021, we have been sourc-
ing 100 percent of the electricity we use, throughout the Group, 
from renewable energy sources. By reaching this milestone, we 
have achieved one of our climate targets.

4-year trend: total CO₂e emissions (Scope 3) in the DT Group
The majority of our total emissions can be classified as Scope 3 
emissions. Scope 3 emissions are all emissions from upstream or 
downstream value chains that are produced in supply chains, 
through business travel, through employee commuting (upstream) 
or through customers’ use of products and services (downstream). 
They are determined in accordance with the globally accepted 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.
In order to reduce our Scope 3 emissions, we are placing increas-
ing priority on climate-protection criteria in our supply chains. This 
commitment is reflected in our CDP Supplier Engagement Rating, 
for which we have been repeatedly awarded the top grade of “A” in 
recent years. The rating for the year under review had not yet been 
announced at the time of the publication of this report. Our ESG 
KPI “CDP Supply Chain Program” indicates the degree to which 
our procurement volume from carbon-intensive suppliers is cov-
ered by the CDP Supply Chain Program. We are also leveraging the 
benefits of blockchain technology and the NFT approach as part of 
a research project that aims to create a decentralized application 
for making visible the impact of product manufacture and trans-
port by suppliers on Scope 3 emissions. A blockchain infrastruc-
ture is being established for collecting data on CO₂ emissions 
along the supplier value chain. A unique NFT is being created for 
the data collected and will be handed over to suppliers in the form 
of a certificate of participation listing all relevant values. We also 
began talks with our key suppliers on implementing our climate 
change mitigation requirements by means of a Supply Chain Emis-
sion Reductions task force.
The graphic presents our Scope 3 emissions from 2020 to 2023, 
broken down by emission source. In 2023, upstream emissions 
accounted for about 73 percent of our Scope 3 emissions, while 
downstream emissions accounted for about 26 percent. The basic 
data used to calculate Scope 3 emissions are reported in the 
benchmarking tool. More information about determination of 
Scope 3 emissions throughout the value chain is available here.

CO2 compensation KPI
Our efforts to prevent greenhouse gases include relying on renew-
able energies, and reducing our energy consumption through 
more energy-efficient technologies. So far, however, this has not 
allowed us to prevent all CO₂ emissions, which is why we offset 
those emissions by investing in certified climate change mitigation 
projects (including events in Germany).
Our Event Policy specifies the ways in which we offset emissions 
generated by events. In 2023, we offset over 17 000 metric tons 
of CO₂ through various measures. 15 000 metric tons of CO₂ were 
offset through renewable energy projects. We offset a further 1 
400 metric tons of CO₂ through carbon removal projects. The pro-
jects are designed to remove carbon from the atmosphere and 
store it on a permanent basis.
We are aiming to reach climate neutrality by the end of 2025. We 
plan to achieve this goal by investing in measures for capturing 
CO₂ emissions and have defined the cornerstones of our strategy. 
We only consider projects that capture and store CO₂ permanently 
or for the long term and satisfy the Oxford categories IV and V at a 
minimum. In this context, we conducted an extensive market study 
and will pursue a mixture of nature-based removals (through refor-
estation, for example) and tech-based removals (such as techno-
logical solutions for carbon disposal), with the aim of successively 
increasing the technology-oriented share. We also consider the 
failure of potential projects and their interaction with other require-
ments (such as local communities) in our planning, to ensure our 
objective of long-term capture.

Our approach to more renewable energy
We had set ourselves the following goal for the end of 2021: for 
the Group as a whole to meet 100 percent of its electricity require-
ments with renewable energy sources. And we have achieved this 
goal. As a result, we now meet more than 90 percent of our total 
energy requirements with renewable energy sources. To under-
score this commitment, we have joined the global RE100 initiative, 
which aims to advance the purchase of electricity from renewable 
sources.
In this context, we are sourcing more green electricity directly, 
acquiring corresponding guarantees of origin, or concluding spe-
cial power purchase agreements (PPAs). As of the end of 2023, 
32.5 percent of the power used throughout the Group was 
obtained via PPAs. In Germany and Europe the figure was 30 per-
cent. We aim to increase this figure to 50 percent by 2025 in Ger-
many and Europe. Whenever possible and practicable, we invest in 
our own power plants, such as cogeneration plants or photovoltaic 
systems.
As of the end of 2023, we operated over 308 photovoltaic systems 
in Germany, for our own electricity requirements, with a total gen-
erating capacity of about 6.01 MWp (Megawatt-peak).  In 2023, 
we pressed ahead with the construction of further PV systems. In 
2024, we plan to commission a three-digit number of PV systems.
We use the ESG KPI “Renewable Energy” to measure our progress. 
In addition, we have also introduced parameters throughout the 
Group that are used to assess electricity procurement at all of our 
national companies in terms of sustainability.
Since 2019, we have been testing a climate-neutral power supply 
for cellular base stations in which we use fuel cells instead of die-
sel generators. Fuel cells are economical, silent, low-maintenance 
and, most importantly, thanks to the use of bio-methanol, carbon 
neutral.
ESG KPI “Renewable Energy”
The ESG KPI “Renewable Energy” is calculated as the share of 
renewable energy in the Group’s total electricity consumption. 
Since 2021, we have been sourcing 100 percent of the electricity 
we use, throughout the Group, from renewable energy sources. By 
reaching this milestone, we have achieved one of our climate tar-
gets.
We are working to reduce our energy consumption overall, by 
improving our energy efficiency and implementing energy-saving 
measures. Further information can be found here.
Although we meet our power requirements wherever possible via 
PPAs, our own power generation, and direct purchases, capacity 
limitations require us to also depend on sources for which guaran-
tees of origin (GOs) come into play. GOs are an important element 
in our efforts to meet 100 percent of our electricity requirements 
via renewable energy sources and thereby achieve our climate tar-
get in this area.

Germany segment: renewable energy
The Germany segment aims to expand and operate its networks 
on a responsible, environmentally friendly and sustainable basis. 
To this end, like all other Group departments, it is meeting its 
energy needs entirely using renewable sources.
Purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources
Power purchase agreements (PPAs) for green energy are a key 
instrument in Germany’s energy transition. Deutsche Telekom sub-
sidiary Power & Air Solutions (PASM), which supplies Telekom 
Deutschland with energy, is steadily increasing the proportion of 
energy it purchases under these PPAs. Some 495 GWh of energy 
were purchased via PPAs in 2023.
During the year under review, Vattenfall began work to construct 
Germany’s largest agrivoltaic installation in Mecklenburg–Western 
Pomerania. The energy supplier plans to establish a combination 
of solar panels and agricultural activity over an area of 93 hectares. 
Telekom Deutschland intends to purchase all of the solar energy 
produced there once it has been completed. The 79 MW installa-
tion has the potential to supply energy to some 2 500 cellular base 
stations.
The partnership between PASM and energy utility EnBW promises 
to deliver clean energy from the North Sea. Deutsche Telekom has 
signed a new PPA that will see it receive 400 GWh of wind energy 
per year in future from the “He Dreiht” (Dutch for “He turns”) wind 
park, one of EnBW’S largest offshore wind parks in Europe. Con-
struction is due to begin in May 2024.
Energy from photovoltaic systems
Deutsche Telekom continued to fit photovoltaic systems to more 
of its roof surfaces and open spaces in 2023. The addition of new 
buildings in the year under review means that the Group’s photo-
voltaic capacity has increased in many locations. These properties 
will also be fitted with photovoltaic panels in coming years. For the 
sake of efficiency, PASM works with energy start-ups such as 
ENVIRIA and Emondo, among others.
Building our own power storage systems 
Power storage plays a key role in the generation of green energy, 
which is weather-dependent. For this reason, PASM began to build 
large storage systems in 2022. These systems store surplus 
renewable energy for subsequent use as required. Construction 
work commenced on some of the storage solutions in 2022 and 
was continued at four Deutsche Telekom sites in Germany in the 
year under review. Once this work is complete, the company will 
have a total storage capacity of 300 MWh. With these efforts, 
Telekom Deutschland is leading the way in the telecommunica-
tions industry.

Our approach to energy-efficient networks
We operate our own fixed-line and mobile networks in Europe and 
the United States. The majority of our energy requirements come 
from operating this network infrastructure. We are continuously 
increasing the capacity and performance of our networks to han-
dle growing amounts of data and improve the speed and quality of 
data transmission. We are also aiming to stabilize our energy con-
sumption and increase our energy efficiency by 2024, in spite of 
growing data traffic and our network expansion. In a Group-wide 
technology-innovation project, we are studying and developing 
new ways of making our network operations even more energy-
efficient and sustainable. In the process, we are looking especially 
carefully at the areas of energy transport, energy availability, and 
energy efficiency. For example, we plan to optimize energy con-
sumption in our mobile and fixed-network operations, and to 
develop innovative solutions for generating and storing renewable 
energy for use at cellular base stations.
In 2020, we published an energy guideline applicable throughout 
the Group. It helps our national companies implement our Climate 
Strategy. The guideline compiles selected measures and proposed 
solutions for better energy efficiency, including operational 
energy-saving functions, optimized energy management, decom-
missioning of legacy systems, and/or the use of more energy-effi-
cient technologies.
We are pursuing various approaches to stabilize our energy con-
sumption and increase energy efficiency:
	
We are updating our network infrastructure and investing on an 
ongoing basis in new and more efficient network technologies 
to this end. Legacy technology is being replaced as part of this 
process.
	
We have established specifications and requirements that 
firmly anchor energy efficiency within the architecture and 
design phase when selecting new technologies. This applies, 
for instance, to the lighting, monitoring and, above all, cooling 
of our plants.
	
We are expanding our use of photovoltaic systems at Deutsche 
Telekom locations. In the process, we are emphasizing use of 
power storage systems and intelligent load management. 
Power & Air Solutions is testing innovative technologies such as 
fuel cells; energy generation from waste heat, via gas turbines; 
and ice-storage systems for support of mechanical cooling 
systems.
	
We are working with a telecommunications supplier in the 
renewable energy sector to enhance the sustainability and effi-
ciency of the energy generation activities at our cellular base 
stations. Making integrated use of solar energy at these sta-
tions allows us to optimize energy consumption, as confirmed 
by initial tests. The first successful lab tests have also laid the 
foundation for using zero-emission fuel cells to supply climate-
neutral energy to the cellular base stations. We are still in the 
pilot phase here.
	
Also, in the framework of our energy management in Germany, 
we are working to reduce the energy requirements of our build-
ings. We continuously monitor consumption values and use 
this data to identify potential for improving efficiency. The 
energy management practices of our internal energy service 
provider Power & Air Solutions have also been ISO 50001 certi-
fied since 2013.
Impact assessment for our materiality analysis
In the impact assessment for our materiality analysis, we have 
identified energy-intensive processes along our value chain. The 
use of fossil-fuel energy in the upstream and downstream value 
chain is still widespread, making a particularly large contribution 
to global warming and placing pressures on humans and the envi-
ronment. The disposal of electronic waste can also pose further 
problems for the environment and human health. At the same 
time, providing infrastructure for optimizing energy efficiency is a 
proven way of reducing the energy consumption of other indus-
tries and individuals.
In order to address these risks, we involve our suppliers in our envi-
ronmental initiatives as part of our supplier management process.

Germany segment: energy consumption and efficiency
The Germany segment is working to successively increase energy 
efficiency and minimize energy consumption. Total energy con-
sumption stood at 2.3 TWh in the year under review.
Increasing energy efficiency
The Germany segment has once again implemented several 
measures during the year under review to increase energy effi-
ciency. One key aspect of these efforts was the use of power sav-
ing features to minimize energy consumption in mobile operations. 
The process for dismantling outdated Synchronous Digital Hierar-
chy (SDH) platforms was accelerated. These measures supple-
ment initiatives that have already been implemented, such as dis-
mantlement of the obsolete Public Switched Telephone Network 
(PSTN) to make way for the more advanced Integrated Services 
Digital Network (ISDN), and optimization of technical infrastruc-
ture, including modernization of rectifiers.
Energy-saving ideas from employees
During the year under review, Telekom Deutschland encouraged 
its employees to submit energy-saving ideas at MagentaG – the 
quarterly town hall meeting providing updates on activities within 
the segment. A total of 130 ideas were submitted, including prac-
tical proposals such as switching off PCs rather than putting them 
into standby mode, or installing motion sensors for reducing the 
electricity consumption of lighting.
United States segment: energy management
The approach adopted by T-Mobile US to sustainable energy man-
agement includes investing in energy efficiency measures to con-
serve energy where possible and purchasing renewable energy to 
account for the electricity consumed. Mobilizing its resources, 
people, and partnerships to support a thriving planet is one of the 
four pillars of the ESG approach at T-Mobile US.
As customers’ data consumption continues to grow, T-Mobile’s aim 
is to power its network more efficiently and avoid a corresponding 
increase in its energy consumption. To track this, the segment set 
a bold goal of reducing its energy consumption by 95 percent per 
petabyte of data traffic by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.
T-Mobile US is committed to minimizing the environmental impact 
from its energy use. In early 2018, the segment joined RE100, a 
global corporate renewable energy initiative, and set out to source 
all of its electricity from renewable energy by 2021 — another US 
wireless first. T-Mobile US has achieved this goal on schedule 
since 20211 , and remains committed to maintaining this position 
while exploring new renewable energy projects to further diversify 
its portfolio.
Innovating for resilience
Investing in renewable energy at scale helps the segment to diver-
sify its energy portfolio, reduce the potential of price fluctuations 
in the future, and promote the adoption of more sustainable 
energy sources. At the end of 2023, the renewable energy profile 
operated by T-Mobile US included eight large wind and solar farm 
projects through Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs) 
across the country and Puget Sound Energy’s Green Direct pro-
gram. T-Mobile US has also continued to expand our portfolio of 
long-term community solar agreements across the US. Supporting 
these projects enables the company to use its electricity purchas-
ing power for good, bolstering their financial viability and sending 
clean energy to local utility grids.
T-Mobile US also has shorter-term Retail Renewable Agreements 
with the remaining portion of its portfolio matched with unbun-
dled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs).
The company has three on-site solar energy projects in develop-
ment with the first one due to become operational in 2024.
Smarter buildings
Renovations at several of the company’s corporate offices and 
Customer Experience Centers provided an opportunity for 
T-Mobile US to create greener buildings by switching to LED and 
motion-activated lights, as well as touchless faucets in bathrooms.
1  For T-Mobile’s 100% renewable electricity commitment, T-Mobile matches its 
own annual electrical usage with renewable energy from a portfolio of sources 
including: virtual power purchase agreements, a "Green Direct" program, 
renewable retail agreements, community solar agreements, and unbundled 
REC purchases.
Europe segment: energy efficiency
We improved our energy efficiency by around 20 percent in the 
Europe segment during the year under review, with data volume 
growing faster than the consumption of energy used to provide 
services. This has been made possible by investments in modern 
technology, as well as the deactivation of legacy network technol-
ogies.
Our networks account for around 70 percent of our total energy 
requirements in the Europe segment, approximately 50 percent for 
mobile and 20 percent for fixed network. The expansion of these 
networks has led to an increase in our energy demand, which the 
national companies have offset by implementing modernization, 
modification, and other savings measures in mobile and fixed-net-
work operations.
For example, the Greek OTE Group has successfully tested an AI-
based tool, which has delivered savings in the mobile network. 
Some 15 GWh of savings were achieved in 2023. Energy savings 
were also made in the mobile sector as a result of deactivating the 
3G networks in North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Slovakia. Addi-
tionally, a network partnership concluded with O2 in Slovakia in 
2023 is enabling significant reductions in energy consumption in 
the mobile network.
The switch from copper to fiber-optic cables in the fixed network is 
helping to achieve faster and more efficient data transmission and 
thus to reduce energy consumption. We have made progress on 
this front in many countries.
We also cut our energy consumption by making more efficient use 
of office buildings. This involved consolidating our locations by 
subletting and selling vacant space. Air-conditioning units and 
heating systems were run in economy mode at the remaining loca-
tions. Additionally, we introduced AI- and other software-based 
savings measures. The Hungarian national company successfully

tested an AI-based application at its headquarters during the year 
under review. This application uses sensors to detect when 
employees enter the building and adjusts the heating or air-condi-
tioning accordingly. This software enabled Magyar Telekom to 
optimize the use of its building in 2023, delivering some 1.78 GWh 
in energy savings. One of the OTE Group’s buildings in Attica, 
Greece was also certified “good” under the Building Research 
Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) 
during the year under review; prior to this, it had been renovated 
in accordance with international environmental and energy stand-
ards.
System Solutions segment: energy efficiency throughout the 
value chain 
As part of Deutsche Telekom, the System Solutions segment has 
also committed itself to the Group-wide climate targets. The seg-
ment set up its own program to this end in 2020, with a focus on 
two areas: its own processes on the one hand and its product 
offering and business customer enablement on the other.
Data center energy efficiency
T-Systems is gradually making its data centers more energy-effi-
cient, with the aid of innovative technologies and artificial intelli-
gence. As an operator, T-Systems is careful to use energy-efficient 
server and storage hardware. As part of its Data Center Next pro-
gram, launched in 2019, it is making use of efficiency-enhancing 
measures, such as selective cooling of individual areas, and oper-
ating temperature increases within possible ranges – always in 
conformance with defined thresholds. Testing is being carried out 
with regard to gradually raising the operating temperature at data 
centers, with a one degree increase corresponding to an energy 
efficiency gain of approximately 1 percent.  Software features 
which allow unused hardware to be switched off entirely without 
affecting currently running applications will be used for further 
optimizations. The medium- to long-term goal is to refine the 
cloud applications to meet energy efficiency requirements (green 
coding). T-Systems continue to work on optimizing energy effi-
ciency in all data centers. Since launching the Data Center Next 
program, we have already reduced energy consumption in our 
data centers by over 37 percent.
T-Systems has participated in the EU Code of Conduct on Data 
Centre Energy Efficiency (EU DC CoC) since 2014. EU DC CoC is 
voluntary in nature and aims to motivate operators and owners of 
data centers to reduce energy consumption and hence their nega-
tive impact on the environment, the economy, and energy supply 
security. The initiative refers to this type of involvement as “partici-
pation.” The related European Commission page provides trans-
parent, detailed information about the participation of individual 
data centers. T-Systems also joined the Climate Neutral Data Cen-
tre Pact (CNDCP) in 2021. With this move, it has committed to 
making all of its own data centers, and the externally operated 
data centers within its sphere, climate neutral by 2030 at the lat-
est. T-Systems were certified as an official member by the CNDCP 
in 2023, following an audit of the following five areas: energy effi-
ciency, renewable energy use, water efficiency, circular economy 
for electronics, and circular economy for heat. T-Systems’ data 
centers around the world have been running on 100 percent 
renewable energy since 2021. To this end, renewable energy is 
sourced directly wherever it is available. Where this is not possible 
electricity requirements are covered by concluding power pur-
chase agreements (PPAs), generating our own energy, or purchas-
ing guarantees of origin. You can find more information on renewa-
ble energy at Deutsche Telekom here.
The European Commission presented the T-Systems data center in 
Biere with the European Code of Conduct Award in 2023. The 
award recognized the data center for its PUE score, best practices 
and energy-efficiency methods, among other things. With a PUE 
of 1.3, the data center in Biere is one of the most energy-efficient 
in Europe.
At the end of 2023, T-Systems operated a total of 16 FMO (Future 
Mode of Operation) twin-core data centers in Europe at eight sites 
– eight for internal and eight for external processing – in addition 
to four local customer-specific data centers. Seven of the eight 
internal European FMO twin-core data centers, plus one external 
FMO twin-core data center, have been included in the EU Code of 
Conduct list since 2023. By taking part in the “EU Code of Con-
duct”, T-Systems meets an important criterion for achieving taxon-
omy alignment under the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities 
(EU Taxonomy). More information about the commitment within 
the framework of the EU Taxonomy is available here.
Raising awareness among employees
The company’s employees, at all of its production sites and in all 
countries in which it is located, are being made more aware of the 
need to think and act with sustainability in mind ( for instance, by 
promoting alternative mobility solutions, participating in “cam-
paign days” focused on sustainability, participating in sustainabil-
ity-oriented workshops, and providing information about ways to 
reduce power and resource consumption). The susTain Roadshow 
was held for the first time during the year under review, with 120 
colleagues in four German cities using the opportunity to find out 
about T-Systems’ sustainability activities. There were presenta-
tions as well as opportunities for attendees get involved.

These activities were supplemented by an open call to raise 
awareness of sustainability issues among employees around the 
world as well. 377 participants dialed in to learn more and engage 
in dialog. We also ran formal dialog events and smaller learning 
units with our international subsidiaries in which we provided 
information on sustainability and support for implementing the 
measures locally.
T-Systems supports relevant employee initiatives, such as the 
Green Pioneers in Germany. Moreover, Sustainability is an integral 
part of the onboarding program for all new T-Systems employees. 
An employee training course was developed in 2022 to train up 
staff members as sustainability ambassadors. Over 600 employ-
ees have already completed the course. In the year under review, 
T-Systems and Deutsche Telekom began to develop a digital 
Deutsche Telekom Sustainability Campus for all employees, which 
will comprise three competence levels. The first module is set to 
be made available during the first six months of 2024.
Expanding the green fleet
In January 2023, Deutsche Telekom issued an internal directive in 
Germany to only order company cars with electric drive systems 
going forward. This requirement has been applicable internation-
ally for the Systems Solutions segment since 2022. T-Systems had 
a total of 1 959 company cars in its fleet at the end of 2023, 382 
of which were electric vehicles. At this same time, most of our 
Meet & Connect Hubs had been fitted with charging stations. 
Meet & Connect Hubs are the central locations of T-Systems and 
are designed to offer the ideal environment for working in teams. 
They provide collaboration rooms and innovative spaces that 
cover a whole range of requirements and uses.
More sustainable buildings
T-Systems was able to reduce its building capacity in Germany by 
more than half during the year under review, which also reduced 
heating and district heating. T-Systems also plans to offset CO₂ 
emissions through the use of neutralization technologies such as 
vertical farming, with a pilot project set to launch at its data center 
site in Biere in 2024.
ESG KPI “Energy Intensity” DT Group 
This year sees us reporting our energy intensity on the basis of two 
different indicators: data volume and revenue. Both KPI figures 
take into account total energy consumption for all energy sources 
– electricity, fuel, gas, and district heating.
We began to report our energy consumption in proportion to our 
managed data volumes in 2016 in the form of the ESG KPI “Energy 
Consumption” – data volume. Using data volume as a reference 
parameter makes it possible to create a direct link to the perfor-
mance of our networks. The data volume is composed of the trans-
mitted IP data volumes (including Voice over IP, Internet, IP-TV).
Our ambition in this connection: reduce the KPI
 Data assured by Deloitte. Data is partly based on estimates, 
assumptions and projections. 
There has been a steady reduction in energy intensity, relative to 
data volume.
In preparation for future reporting in accordance with the CSRD, 
we are this year reporting not only energy intensity in proportion to 
data volume, but also energy intensity in proportion to revenue. 
This allows us to measure our progress in reducing our energy 
consumption within the context of our economic performance.
To enable better comparison between this indicator and the ratio 
of energy intensity to data volume, we slightly modified the calcu-
lation methodology for the Group’s values in 2023. Starting in 
2023, we now include the energy consumption of all segments, 
including those outside our fixed-network and mobile business 
segments (such as cloud business).

“PUE” ESG KPI: lower carbon emissions in data centers
We are continually improving the energy efficiency of our data 
centers through a range of measures. The Power Usage Effective-
ness (PUE) metric serves as one indicator for energy-efficiency 
enhancements in our data centers. We determine this metric using 
the method recommended by the standard EN 50600 for data 
centers, which has to take the total energy consumed by data 
centers into account – and not only that used to operate the serv-
ers. The PUE factor is calculated using the ratio between the total 
electrical energy consumed by the data center and the amount of 
electrical energy consumed by IT.
In 2023, the average global PUE score for our T-Systems data 
centers was 1.53. For our data centers in Germany, we reduced 
the PUE from 1.85 in 2008 to 1.52 in 2023; this value is signifi-
cantly below the average for all data centers in Germany, which is 
around 1.70. Our most-efficient high-availability data center has a 
PUE of 1.24. This will allow us to compensate, in part, for increases 
in IT systems’ energy requirements as a result of growing volumes 
of data. Energy consumption is also reduced relative to the 
increasing processing power of the IT systems as a result of the 
positive effect on energy efficiency and, by extension, the PUE 
score. The energy needs of our T-Systems data centers are met 
entirely using renewable sources.

Enablement factor: customers reducing CO₂ emissions
ICT solutions enable customers to save on resources, and thus 
reduce their emissions, through efficiency gains and demateriali-
zation. At the same time, customer savings must not be canceled 
out by an increase in emissions generated through the provision of 
digital services. The enablement factor is calculated to give us an 
overview of this ratio and thus our overall contribution to climate 
change mitigation – be that positive or negative. The enablement 
factor shows the savings potential for our customers in relation to 
our own carbon footprint. An enablement factor of 2, for example, 
means that customers save twice as much CO₂ when using our 
digital solutions as Deutsche Telekom consumes in total for those 
solutions. Our solutions thus make a positive overall contribution 
to reducing emissions and climate change mitigation.
Since 2014, we have been drawing on data to study the potential 
savings that various products can achieve on the user side; we car-
ried out 15 such assessments in 2023. Since 2021, we have been 
recording the emission reductions from the installation of efficient 
wall charging stations for electric cars, known as wallboxes. The 
largest savings potential (in Germany) is found in virtual working, 
that is, in the use of our broadband infrastructure and web- and 
video-conferencing solutions to enable employees to work from 
home. Other major savings potential lies with cloud computing, 
which allows for better utilization of capacity thanks to a modern, 
energy-efficient, shared IT infrastructure that runs on green elec-
tricity. More powerful servers, more energy-efficient data centers, 
and higher infrastructure capacity utilization can thus cut energy 
consumption and the associated emissions for our customers by 
up to 80 percent.
In addition, we are currently supporting the European Green Digi-
tal Coalition (EGDC) in its work to develop an industry standard for 
calculating emissions savings from ICT products. This standard is 
designed to increase transparency and credibility and lead to 
improved comparability when calculating savings.

ESG KPI “Enablement Factor” DT Group in Germany 
We use the ESG KPI “Enablement factor” to calculate the positive 
CO₂ effects facilitated for our customers through using our prod-
ucts and shows them in relation to the emissions we generate in 
delivering these products. This allows us to measure our overall 
performance in terms of climate change mitigation. According to 
this figure, the positive CO₂ effects facilitated for our customers in 
Germany were 378 percent higher in 2023 than our own CO₂ 
emissions (enablement factor of 4.78 to 1). The year-on-year 
increase (enablement factor of 3.8 to 1) is due primarily to the 
reduction in our Scope 3 emissions. The enabled emissions sav-
ings remained at almost the same level as the previous year, 
despite the loss of savings from smart logistics and a significant 
decline in savings from video conferences.
Our products and solutions generated positive CO₂ effects for our 
customers amounting to 16.9 million metric tons in the year under 
review.

Our approach to circular economy
Consumption of natural resources continues to increase globally. 
According to the German Environment Agency (UBA), the use of 
non-renewable raw materials in particular is associated with signif-
icant intervention in ecosystems and the water balance, and gives 
rise to waste and pollution.
Our goal is to make our product portfolio increasingly sustainable. 
In this connection, we are taking a holistic approach to conserving 
resources and are working to ensure that resources are used 
responsibly throughout our entire value chain. We aim to make 
products and materials as durable as possible and to ensure they 
are always recycled at the end of their lifetimes. Recycling prod-
ucts and materials and using them for longer not only saves on 
resources, but also reduces energy use and emissions, thus con-
tributing to climate change mitigation. By 2030, we intend to 
ensure that almost all of the products we bring into circulation can 
be returned to the circular ecosystem. This also applies to the net-
work technology we use. Additionally, we work to ensure that the 
products and services we use at the workstations in our office 
facilities, in our Telekom Shops and in our data centers are com-
patible with the circular economy. Office supplies and materials for 
marketing are one example of such products.
Our approach in this area is holistic, covering the areas “Resource 
efficiency in operations,” “Green products and services” and 
“Waste prevention and recycling” (see graphic).
Resource efficiency in operations
Our efforts to enhance resource efficiency in operations focus on 
our IT infrastructure, our sustainable buildings, and our work-
places. They also include the switch to fully electric company cars 
and service vehicles, along with additional measures for promoting 
sustainable mobility.
Waste prevention and recycling
We are committed to the reuse and proper recycling of electronic 
devices. The zero waste approach and the associated ‘waste pyra-
mid’ concept provide the key frame of reference for us in this 
regard. This is why, for example, we offer products (our routers, for 
instance) for rental and accept returned used devices (such as cell 
phones). Wherever possible, we refurbish returned devices for 
resale and reuse, i.e., put them back into circulation. In some of our 
flagship stores in Europe, we offer what we call repair bars, where 
we repair or replace displays, rechargeable batteries, and back 
covers of devices from several manufacturers. Products that can-
not be reused are properly recycled as part of our waste manage-
ment process. For recycling of copper cables, we have adopted a 
special guideline that is binding throughout the Group. Such 
cables are being partially replaced over the course of our fiber-
optic rollout.
Green products & services
We are constantly enhancing our range of sustainable offerings – 
throughout a spectrum from environmentally friendly products 
and services to our green shops. In addition, we strongly encour-
age our suppliers to use resources responsibly and to reuse mate-
rials wherever possible. This includes reducing the amount of plas-
tic, paper and packaging they utilize, and using recycled materials.
The basis: a certified management system
With our health, safety, and environmental management system 
(HSE), we have made a commitment to continually improving our 
performance in these areas. In 2021, it was successfully recerti-
fied, until the end of 2024, in accordance with the international 
standards ISO 45001 on occupational health and safety, ISO 
14001 on environmental management, and ISO 9001 on quality 
management. Surveillance audits were carried out in 2022 and 
2023 for this purpose. Our Group environmental policy, which was 
amended and adopted by the CR Board during the year under 
review, summarizes all of the current voluntary ecological commit-
ments in effect throughout the Group. The amendments were 
made in response to the growing relevance of topics such as the 
circular economy, biodiversity, and water scarcity, and include 
updates to the EMF Policy.
European targets
Our European national companies have set themselves the target 
of being fully circular around devices by 2030 within the frame-
work of our EU strategy for resource efficiency. This means intro-
ducing appropriate measures to ensure that their device portfolio 
is fully circular by the end of the decade. This also includes striving 
to ensure throughout Europe that no electronic waste produced by

Deutsche Telekom’s national companies, and no returned devices, 
such as smartphones, routers, or laptops, wind up in landfills – and 
that such waste and devices (where not refurbishable) are properly 
disposed of or recycled as they would be in Germany (target: “Zero 
Waste for ICT to Landfill”). This target was achieved by the end of 
2022.
Sustainable packaging
As of mid-2022, all Deutsche-Telekom-branded products launched 
on the market have been packaged sustainably throughout 
Europe, in keeping with our Sustainability Packaging Guideline. 
Packaging for smartphones that we purchase from our suppliers 
must also meet these criteria. In the 2023 reporting year, we were 
not aware of any violations of the packaging guidelines by suppli-
ers in this context. We monitor compliance with the criteria by 
means of regular factory audits.
Measurement of progress
We are continually working to improve our performance indicators 
to be able to review our Group-wide progress. In 2021, we devel-
oped a comprehensive new set of performance indicators. This has 
enabled us to set clear-cut goals and to report transparently on 
progress. The ESG KPI “Mobile Device Take-Back” existed prior to 
the overhaul of our set of performance indicators, and we have 
also been keeping records since 2021 of the numbers of items of 
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) we have collected, for 
instance. We measure progress toward copper cable recycling 
with the KPI “Copper Cable Recycling.”
Impact assessment for our materiality analysis
Most resources for the manufacturing and use of our products and 
network infrastructure are consumed in both upstream and down-
stream stages of the value chain – with our suppliers and custom-
ers. It was here that a negative impact risk was identified as part of 
the impact assessment for our materiality analysis. Consumption 
of natural resources continues to increase globally, negatively 
affecting biodiversity and climate change, and giving rise to waste 
and pollution. We intend to counteract this with our ambitious cir-
cularity target and resulting initiatives.

Resource efficiency at the workplace
We also contribute to resource efficiency at the workplace by 
endeavoring to use as many green office supplies as possible. In 
2023, over 80 percent of all of our catalog-based office supplies in 
Germany were sustainable. We also took the following measures in 
Germany:
	
Our “IT Remarketing” project: Used IT hardware is refurbished 
so that it can be reused.
	
Our partner, the charitable organization “AfB gemeinnützige 
GmbH”, which offers jobs for people with disabilities, receives 
some of our used IT hardware (e.g., laptops) for reconditioning 
and reselling.
	
In our catalog of office supplies, over 80 percent of products 
are classified as sustainable, meaning they have been awarded 
a label recommended by the German Environment Agency 
(UBA). This is an increase of 15 percent from the previous year. 
The labels in question include the EU Ecolabel, the Fairtrade 
seal, the Organic Farming seal, the Blue Angel eco-label, and 
the FSC® and PEFC environmental labels. Office supplies are 
delivered largely in accordance with the carbon neutrality cer-
tificate. On our “You and Me UNITED” social network, we also 
offer our employees a platform where they can exchange used 
office supplies instead of ordering new supplies.
	
Since 2018, we have worked with a paper wholesaler to pur-
chase only environmentally certified paper that has been 
awarded the Blue Angel certificate. Additionally, we are looking 
to work with a range of projects and initiatives to further 
reduce our paper consumption.
	
To meet the requirements of the Minamata Convention and 
curb mercury emissions, we are working to modernize the 
media technology used in our company.
Less food waste in cafeterias
Since 2020, we have been offering our employees discounted 
items in the cafeterias after 4 p.m. at two locations in Germany. 
Employees can purchase food that would otherwise have to be 
thrown away, such as baked goods, salads, and muesli, at half 
price.
In addition, our staff have had the option, since 2021, of getting 
their midday meal as a takeaway lunch in reusable containers 
(“REBOWL”). We also joined forces with Sodexo, the company run-
ning our cafeterias in Germany, to introduce the RECUP returnable 
cup at many Deutsche Telekom sites in Germany in 2018.
Resource efficiency in the network and IT infrastructure
We are currently carrying out projects in this area in various seg-
ments. The common goal: we want to achieve our climate change 
mitigation targets, meet circularity requirements, and introduce a 
holistic total cost of ownership (TCO) approach for our network 
and IT infrastructure.

Germany segment: contribution to achieving a circular 
economy 
The Germany segment uses resources prudently, the goal being to 
avoid creating waste wherever possible, extend the usage lifetime 
of products, and recycle valuable materials as fully as possible. The 
segment is pursuing a range of approaches in this context to moti-
vate customers to use their devices for longer. We also take care to 
handle electronic waste properly and avoid producing waste that 
would need to be disposed of in landfill.
Reuse and recycling of electronic products
The Germany segment is committed to the reuse and proper recy-
cling of the electronic products used by our customers.
It refurbished almost one million customer devices (such as rout-
ers and TV set-top boxes) for reuse in 2023.
Of these refurbished items, the segment sold or rented out around 
460 000 fixed-network devices, and offered its customers some 
450 000 devices as a replacement.
We only recycle products that we are unable to reuse, ensuring 
that they are processed properly. This amounted to approximately 
600 000 devices in 2023.
Second life for used smartphones 
Our “Handyankauf” (phone buybacks) scheme in Germany allows 
customers to give their smartphones a second lease of life by sell-
ing them to our partner Assurant for refurbishment. There are cur-
rently over 1 700 models in our buy-back portfolio. We also offer 
refurbished smartphones in perfect working order with a 
24-month warranty via our “ReUse MyMobile” service. Refurbish-
ing smartphones in this way allows us to increase their usage life-
time and reduce the annual carbon footprint of the Germany seg-
ment and its customers. Our “Handyankauf” and “ReUse MyMo-
bile” programs have both been awarded the #GreenMagenta label.
The Germany segment is working with circular-tech specialist Fox-
way to collect used cell phones and smartphones via the cell-
phone collection center. Each device is examined to check 
whether it can still be refurbished, with the reuse rate standing at 
between 10 and 15 percent. Only devices that no longer have any 
market value are harvested for raw materials and upcycled in Ger-
many, with gold, silver, platinum, and palladium being recovered 
from them. The shared take-back system uses secure, state-of-
the-art solutions for the collection and transport of used devices 
as well as data deletion. The system has been certified by the Ger-
man eco-label Blue Angel. The proceeds from marketing and recy-
cling are used to support projects in nature conservation and envi-
ronmental protection, as well as social projects organized by the 
partners of the cell-phone collection center.

United States segment: minimizing waste
T-Mobile US is committed to diverting as much waste from land-
fills as possible through recycling, composting, avoidance, and 
digitization across the business. An important part of these efforts 
is educating employees on what recycling and disposal options 
are available to them across facilities.
E-waste
As a telecommunications company, managing electronic waste – 
or e-waste – responsibly across our network is a priority. Every 
piece of network equipment that keeps us connected contains 
precious metals, glass, or other raw materials. This is why T-Mobile 
US aims to recover electronic equipment and products by repair-
ing, reusing, recycling or reselling whenever possible.
T-Mobile US continues to assess its network equipment to see 
what can be repaired and reused elsewhere across the business to 
reduce costs and environmental impact.
Device Reuse and Recycling Program
For end-of-life treatment of consumer devices, T-Mobile US ena-
bles responsible device recycling for customers through its Device 
Reuse and Recycling Program. This program facilitates collection, 
upcycling and recycling of smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, 
hotspots, or IoT items at T-Mobile US stores for free.
For device trade-ins, T-Mobile US provides a trade-in estimator 
tool that gives customers an immediate offer on eligible devices. 
Any device that cannot be repaired for reuse is recycled with part-
ners that are certified to the R2 standard which provides a com-
mon set of processes, safety measures and documentation 
requirements. R2 is rigorously and independently audited, empha-
sizing quality, safety and transparency, including any devices 
exported for refurbishment and recycling.
T-Mobile US continues to responsibly manage its e-waste through 
its repair, reuse, and recycling programs.

Europe segment: resource efficiency for mobile and fixed-net-
work devices
The Europe segment set specific targets in 2021 within the frame-
work of our EU strategy for resource efficiency. The countries con-
cerned committed to ensuring that no returned devices, whether 
mobile or fixed-network, wind up in landfills as electronic waste, 
and that such waste and devices are properly recycled as they 
would be in Germany (target: “Zero Waste for ICT to Landfill”). This 
target was achieved by the end of 2022.
Rental models are the main option offered by all European national 
companies when it comes to fixed-network devices. These models 
allow devices to be reused when they are replaced or to be prop-
erly recycled. Our formerly mobile-only companies in Poland have 
been offering a rental model for fixed-network devices since the 
third quarter of 2023.

Many of us have discarded or defective cell phones gathering dust 
in a drawer somewhere. We intend to contribute to saving 
resources and preventing waste by allowing our customers to 
return these devices. Obsolete or defective phones will be properly 
recycled, with valuable resources being extracted in the process. 
We launched the Good Cause initiative in 2022 to underscore to 
our customers the importance and necessity of saving resources. 
All of our national companies from the segment were involved in 
the initiative. We intend to collect one million discarded devices by 
the end of 2024 to refurbish them for reuse or to put the valuable 
resources they contain back into circulation.
All national companies take back used cell phones, primarily at 
their stores, but also via other channels, such as the targeted take-
back campaigns that ran in Poland and Croatia in summer 2023. 
The ongoing take-back process in Croatia and North Macedonia 
even carries the #GreenMagenta label. Up until now, most of the 
national companies have only offered a limited number of refur-
bished smartphones. Before putting these devices back into circu-
lation, we check whether they are suitable for refurbishment and 
refurbish those that are. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, our cus-
tomers, initially in Croatia and Poland, have been able to purchase 
used smartphones that are in good condition as part of a trade-in 
scheme. The Hungarian national company has been working with 
the firm Recommerce since 2023 to offer a large number of refur-
bished mobile devices. Refurbished cell phones in Austria have 
been awarded the #GreenMagenta label. Other countries in the 
Europe segment are planning to launch a similar program in 2024.
For every phone collected, the national companies make a dona-
tion to local projects as part of the Good Cause initiative. These 
projects work in areas such as marine conservation, forest conser-
vation, or ICT solutions to tackle climate change. Alternatively, 
national companies may support NGOs operating locally with their 
projects or initiate projects of their own.
We outline selected projects of the European national companies 
below.
Many of our national companies conducted clean-up campaigns 
during the year under review with the aim of raising public aware-
ness of the problem of marine pollution and at the same time 
encouraging people to collect electronic waste themselves. For 
instance, the OTE Group in Greece worked with NGO Enaleia to 
support the “COSMOTE BLUE” project in summer 2023. The goal 
was to clear the beaches and seas of plastic waste in the Thermaic 
Gulf, Halkidiki, the Argo-Saronic Gulf, and Crete, involving local 
fishing communities in the endeavor. Our national company in 
Montenegro organized a similar event for International Coastal 
Cleanup Day. Held in mid-September each year, it is the country’s 
largest voluntary initiative, bringing participants together to clean 
up coasts and riverbanks. Slovak Telekom worked with NGO BROZ 
in Slovakia to restore and protect wetlands in the Donau-Auen 
National Park that had been damaged by human activity.
There were also a number of forest conservation and reforestation 
initiatives for promoting sustainable agriculture, pond cultures, 
and forestry, along with the production of regional produce. 
Magenta Telekom in Austria, for example, has been working with 
NGO Gut Ottenstein since 2022 to support a project around the 
Ottenstein Reservoir, where extensive damage from storms, bark 
beetle infestations and the like necessitates the planting of new 
trees.
The national company in North Macedonia joined forces with the 
Scout Association of Macedonia to run a reforestation program in 
regions of forest that had suffered severe fire damage.
In Hungary, our national company is assisting the WWF with using 
an environmentally friendly, low-cost monitoring system to main-
tain five newly created wetland areas. The system aids the supply 
water to these areas, which will most likely be at risk in future from 
rising mean temperatures and more irregular rainfall patterns 
resulting from climate change.
T-Mobile Czech Republic is supporting the “Clever Landscape” 
project, a long-term endeavor of the Czech University of Life Sci-
ences in Prague. The project is being conducted in an area meas-
uring over 1 700 hectares as part of the “Smart Forest Landscape 
Jevany” initiative. The goal is to identify and introduce the most 
effective measures for mitigating the impact of water scarcity and 
changes in precipitation patterns resulting from climate change. 
We are leveraging our IoT technologies and data transmission 
capabilities on the 5G network to help develop an adapted land-
scape that should withstand the effects of climate change for 
years to come.

Take Back Mobile Devices ESG KPI (including cell phones)
We report the ESG KPI “Mobile Device Take-Back” based on the 
reference value “number of mobile devices in circulation.” This 
makes it possible to show the ratio of collected devices to the 
number of devices sold. When the devices are used for longer peri-
ods of time, the environment benefits and, as a result, this has a 
positive impact on the KPI.
Our ambition in this connection: increase the KPI

In 2023, over 8 million cell phones were collected throughout the 
Group. The corresponding KPI for the Group-wide value is thus 
25.5 percent. The aim of the scheme for collection of used mobile 
devices is to give the devices a second life and, where that is not 
feasible, to properly recycle them, in order to recover the valuable 
raw materials they contain. This has conserved resources, and it 
has helped to improve the life cycle assessments for mobile 
devices overall.
The quantities of collected devices are reported in kilograms or in 
numbers of items. When using kilograms, we apply a Group-wide 
conversion factor of 7.25 items per kilogram, except where a dif-
ferent conversion factor is typically used in the country concerned. 
The mobile devices in circulation include smartphones, simple 
phones, tablets, and cordless phones. In the interest of data qual-
ity, numbers of items are reported by Procurement.

Take Back CPEs ESG KPI (including fixed-line)
In keeping with our circularity strategy, we also promote refurbish-
ment and proper recycling of Customer Premises Equipment 
(CPE). The CPE category includes modems, routers, repeaters, and 
TV receivers. The aim of the scheme for collection of such devices 
is to give the devices a second life and, where that is not feasible, 
to properly recycle them, in order to recover the valuable raw 
materials they contain.
We have recorded the ESG KPI “CPE Take-Back” and the numbers 
of refurbished CPE items involved since 2021. In 2023, more than 
4 million CPE items were collected across the Group, and 36 per-
cent of that quantity were refurbished.
We are aiming to further improve the collection and refurbishment 
processes, and to achieve 100 percent sustainable management 
of collected CPE items. This would mean that all CPE items col-
lected in Germany or by European national companies would 
either be refurbished, stored for future refurbishment, or recycled. 
Work on implementing relevant measures has already begun.

Waste management and recycling
We are careful with resources – and likewise with waste. Waste 
management throughout our entire Group is organized consist-
ently in line with the International Waste Management Framework. 
On the basis of this framework, our national companies define their 
own measurable targets and monitor progress toward those tar-
gets. This enables them to flexibly comply with general conditions 
specific to each country and company.
The impact assessment in our materiality analysis identified a neg-
ative impact resulting from the generation of waste at office loca-
tions, network build-out work and our data center operations. We 
strive to avoid creating waste wherever possible and to recycle as 
much as possible of the waste we do produce. We are pursuing a 
range of approaches in this context to ensure that we manage 
electronic waste in a controlled manner and avoid it ending up in 
landfills, where waste that is not properly disposed of poses a risk 
of contamination to soil and watercourses. For example, the waste 
pyramid provides us with a methodological framework for avoid-
ing creating waste in the first place and for carefully and properly 
handling any waste that really cannot be avoided. The pyramid is 
broken down into hierarchical levels that must be followed: pre-
vention, reuse, recycling, utilization (to generate electricity, for 
example), and disposal. Our focus in this context is not limited to 
the waste generated by Deutsche Telekom directly; we also take 
account of the devices that are required to use our telecommuni-
cations services and that are sold to our customers through our 
channels. Further information on the circular economy can be 
found here. In 2021, our European national companies defined the 
following common aim: to ensure, by 2024, that no electronic 
waste they produce, and no returned devices, such as smart-
phones, routers, and laptops, wind up in landfills – and that such 
waste and devices are properly disposed of or recycled as they 
would be in Germany. We achieved this goal by the end of 2022 
and are planning to roll out implementation to T-Mobile US and 
T-Systems in future. Additionally, we are constantly working to 
refine our Group-wide set of performance indicators for waste 
management, and we now also collect data on recycling of tech-
nology and hazardous waste as well as monitoring quantities of 
waste produced.

Waste production (including e-waste)
As part of our waste management program, we transparently track 
our waste production. In 2021, we added a performance indicator 
for technology waste to our set of KPIs. As a result, we are now 
able, for the first time, to differentiate between electronic waste 
(e-waste), cable waste, and other technology waste. We have not 
defined Group-wide targets for the reduction of hazardous and 
non-hazardous waste. The national companies are guided by our 
International Waste Management Framework adopted in 2013; 
they use it as a basis for developing or revising their own waste 
management strategies. They are also setting their own targets, 
giving top priority to reducing hazardous waste such as lead bat-
teries.
Group-wide waste increased by 5 percent compared with 2022. 
A major factor in this rise is the 5G mobile network build-out work 
currently underway, the associated dismantlement of older 3G 
technology, and the fiber-optic build-out in the fixed network. We 
provide detailed information on the figures for each individual 
company in our interactive benchmarking tool.

Paper-free and low-paper work
Running a large company like Deutsche Telekom involves high 
paper consumption. For several years now, we have gradually been 
reducing our paper consumption. With our Paperless Office pro-
ject, we aim to completely eliminate paper use by 2025.
Print on demand has many advantages. For example, quick refer-
ence guides can be printed as needed depending on orders and 
don’t need to be preprinted, transported, and stored. Changes to 
information sheets for our customers can be made on short notice, 
eliminating large quantities of outdated documents that need to 
be destroyed. In 2021, we expanded this project, and print on 
demand is now available for printing quick reference guides for all 
the rate plans we offer in Germany (MagentaZuhause, MagentaTV, 
business-customer and hybrid plans). We also reviewed whether 
there are other materials suitable for print on demand – such as 
those containing brochures and SIM cards. The process is not yet 
suitable for all of the materials we work with. This applies to the 
SIM cards for our hybrid plans, for example. Since March 2021, 
print-on-demand instructions have been marked with our #Green-
Magenta label.

In 2023, we implemented various measures in Germany with a 
view to minimizing our consumption still further. We have already 
cut paper consumption by 85 percent in various paperless stores 
throughout Europe, not least by opting not to offer printed bro-
chures and flyers in our shops.

Germany segment: contribution to waste prevention, 
recycling, and resource conservation
Recovered copper cables
Copper cables were the main component of telephone lines for 
decades. They are now being replaced as part of the fiber-optic 
build-out. In 2023, the Germany segment removed over 1 579 
metric tons of copper cable from cable ducts. Certified waste dis-
posal facilities process the cables in accordance with environmen-
tal standards, and up to 90 percent of the material is then recy-
cled.
Reducing paper use through digitalization
The German segment intends to save on resources by continuing 
to reduce the volume of paper documents, such as bills, flyers, and 
other types of documents used for customer communication, and 
is working to digitalize these documents wherever possible.
In 2023, for instance, Telekom Deutschland conducted campaigns 
in the business and consumer segments to motivate customers to 
switch from paper to online billing. Through customers transition-
ing to online billing, the segment eliminated some five million 
paper bills in the year under review (as of August 2023).
In the business customer segment of Telekom Deutschland, we 
increased our online-bill percentages for fixed-network services to 
73.69 percent and mobile services to 65.28 percent. In the con-
sumer segment of Telekom Deutschland, we were able to maintain 
our high online-bill percentages: 88.82 percent for fixed-network 
services and 95.24 percent for mobile services.
The Germany segment is also digitalizing the process of signing 
our contracts by hand by converting to digital signatures. With the 
help of DocuSign, the segment offers the option of signing docu-
ments digitally and in compliance with the law. 72 percent of 
Telekom Deutschland’s business partners were already using 
digital signatures in 2023.
The Germany segment also made a contribution to digitalizing 
mandatory contractual communications, such as bills and order 
confirmations, that are otherwise sent in the mail. The volume of 
dispatched letters was reduced by 14.6 percent compared with 
the previous year, saving more than 180 metric tons of paper in 
2023.

Sustainable product packaging
As of mid-2022, all Deutsche-Telekom-branded products launched 
on the German and European markets have been packaged sus-
tainably. For this conversion, we have developed appropriate sus-
tainability criteria, and enshrined them in a packaging guideline. 
Wherever possible, we use recyclable and biodegradable materi-
als, recycled paper, and non-toxic labels and printing (e.g., using 
soy ink). In addition, we use absolutely no single-use plastic in our 
packaging. This packaging guideline is part of our Standard Design 
Specifications, which apply throughout the Group (with the excep-
tion of T-Mobile US), and which also include sustainability require-
ments for product components and design. All product manufac-
turers must meet these criteria when developing Deutsche 
Telekom devices.
For our product packaging we use materials such as PaperFoam, a 
biobased and biodegradable alternative to conventional packag-
ing materials. PaperFoam is non-toxic, compostable, and it 
reduces the carbon footprint by up to 85 percent compared with 
other materials. As of 2021, the packaging of the Speedport Smart 
4 router sold in Germany is made of this material, for instance. In 
addition, 95 percent of the router’s housing consists of recycled 
plastic.
As of mid-2022, all Deutsche-Telekom-branded products launched 
on the market have been packaged sustainably throughout 
Europe, in keeping with our Sustainability Packaging Guideline. 
Packaging for smartphones that we purchase from our suppliers 
must also meet these criteria. In the 2023 reporting year, we were 
not aware of any violations of the packaging guidelines by suppli-
ers in this context. We monitor compliance with the criteria by 
means of regular factory audits.
Since 2021, we have reported Group-wide figures on sustainably 
packaged devices, differentiating between our own sustainably 
packaged fixed-network devices and sustainably packaged mobile 
devices (e.g., mobile routers, smartphones, and tablets). The year-
on-year increase is mainly due to the consistent application of the 
packaging directive for all of our newly launched products and an 
improvement in the survey methodology.

We also want to make logistics more sustainable. To that end, we 
plan to optimize parcel packaging, for example. In particular, we 
plan to discontinue use of plastic in such packaging. Since 2021, 
we have been saving around 4 700 kilograms of plastic per year by 
dispensing with wrapping plastic in technical logistics in Germany 
alone. We are also working to optimize paper and cardboard con-
sumption in our shipping logistics. In 2020, we began using a 
cardboard shredder. This has enabled us to reduce our use of 
paper as fill material by 50 metric tons of paper per year. To make 
even greater use of optimization potential in this area, we are in 
discussion with the national companies outside of Germany and 
are working with them to develop relevant innovative concepts.

More sustainable Deutsche Telekom buildings
We want to make our buildings in Germany as sustainable as pos-
sible. To that end, we are implementing various measures to 
reduce their CO₂ emissions, improve their energy balance, opti-
mize waste separation, and facilitate longer use of their furniture.
Reducing vacancy is one of the most effective ways to increase 
sustainability, since lower vacancy levels can lead to significant 
CO₂-emissions and energy savings. We are currently examining our 
future office-space requirements, and developing plans that will 
enable us to use our office space in the best possible way. In the 
process, we are testing new, more-flexible space/office concepts. 
The overall aim is to optimize space utilization in our buildings. 
Also, we are reducing our unused office space – for example, by 
subletting it. Such efforts are enabling us to prevent vacancies and 
save energy.
Over 106 592 square meters of building space in Germany were 
certified to LEED or BREEAM standards in 2023. Additionally, 
approximately one million square meters of office space meet the 
criteria of a sustainable building standard, despite not being certi-
fied.
Energy efficiency
In order to minimize the energy requirements of our buildings in 
Germany, we are carrying out a range of measures, including the 
following:

To identify anomalies in energy consumption, we use specific 
indicators such as “kilowatt hours per square meter” to com-
pare similar facilities. In addition, we analyze the course of 
energy consumption (load profile) of individual buildings. On 
the basis of the findings from such analysis, we initiate meas-
ures to prevent peak loads and optimize energy use, with the 
aim of reducing total energy requirements.

We use communication measures to raise awareness of energy 
consumption among our employees and motivate them to be 
energy-conscious in the workplace.

We pay attention to energy efficiency during construction and 
renovation work on a building’s exterior.
The Deutsche Telekom subsidiary Power & Air Solutions (PASM) 
procures energy for the Deutsche Telekom Group companies in 
Germany. Its energy management system is certified as per the 
ISO 50001 international standard. In addition, our office buildings 
undergo an energy audit pursuant to DIN standard 16247 every 
four years.
Heating and hot water
We regularly assess the need for repairs at our properties in Ger-
many and conduct cost-effectiveness analyses to further reduce 
our energy consumption for heating and hot water. Measures 
include:

Energy optimization of heating systems (e.g., by replacing old 
burner technologies)

Updating heat generators and related hydraulic components 
(such as pumps and valves)

Using waste heat (e.g., by using heat recovery systems)

Using combined heat and power (e.g., from cogeneration 
plants or district heating)

Reducing supply losses when heating water (e.g., by switching 
to local hot water supply)
Electricity
Building services account for the biggest share of electricity con-
sumption in office buildings (e.g., pumps, ventilation and cooling 
systems, building automation systems, elevators, and lighting). To 
reduce electricity consumption, we are focusing on the following 
measures in Germany:

Using LED lighting and motion sensors

Turning off light sources (advertising pylons) at night


We are also adding additional charging stations for electric 
cars to our parking areas in order to promote electromobility.
Internet of Things (IoT) and innovations
In Germany, we are optimizing our facility management with the 
help of sensor technologies. This includes the following measures:

Using sensor technology to actively control indoor tempera-
tures in buildings in real time

Using predictive maintenance in elevator maintenance and 
repair

Using predictive weather-dependent building technology 
controls

Using thermal and fluidic building simulation to increase the 
efficiency of buildings and their building services

Using sensors to collect building usage data. We utilize this 
data to optimize the energy consumption and cost-effective-
ness of our shops across the board.
Sustainable Deutsche Telekom buildings outside Germany
Internationally, we are also implementing measures to reduce 
energy consumption, such as optimizing the energy efficiency of 
major sites and switching off advertising pylons at night. We car-
ried out simulation tests in 2022 to identify energy-saving poten-
tial in technical buildings. The results showed that technical equip-
ment can be designed with lower capacity in these cases, making 
it possible to improve power distribution readings. As a result, 
adjustments have been made to the internal planning process and 
the reading process has been digitalized. We also carry out cam-
paigns to raise awareness among our employees of the need to 
save energy.
In Greece, three buildings of the OTE Group received LEED Gold 
(Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification: the 
Kerameikos office building; the COSMOTE TV Services building; 
and the Group’s Solonos office building in central Athens, which 
was renovated in 2020. All three were certified to the Gold level 
under the U.S. Green Building Council’s (USGBC) international 
LEED certification scheme for green and sustainable buildings. 
The Agia Paraskevi building in Greece was also certified under 
the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment 
Method (BREEAM).
Over 192 219 square meters of our building space outside Ger-
many were certified to LEED or a comparable standard in 2023.

Water consumption
As a service provider, almost all of the water we use is consumed 
within the scope of our office activities. Similarly, water consump-
tion only plays a minor role along our supply chain. For that reason, 
water is not a main focal area in our CR management activities. 
Nevertheless, our environmental guideline does call for reducing 
our water consumption. We measure our annual consumption by 
means of our water consumption indicator.
In the year under review, there was a slight, 20 percent decrease in 
Group-wide water consumption.
We provide detailed information on the figures for each individual 
company in our interactive benchmarking tool.
Protecting biodiversity
The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity describes 
biodiversity as the diversity of all living organisms, habitats and 
ecosystems on land, in freshwater, in the oceans and in the air. This 
interpretation allows for many topics to be categorized under the 
heading of biodiversity. Topics such as climate change mitigation, 
waste, and water that we address at Deutsche Telekom have an 
indirect influence on biodiversity. In order to review our activities 
specifically in terms of their direct influence and impact on this 
topic, we conducted an analysis in 2023 of our impact on biodiver-
sity and our dependence on ecosystem services all the way along 
our value chain. This analysis was based on the parameters of the 
ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks, and 
Exposure) tool, which is designed to aid understanding and evalua-
tion of natural capital risks. Like our materiality analysis, it con-
firmed that biodiversity is not directly relevant to us as a topic. 
Indeed, we did not identify any significant direct impact in our own 
business operations. Similarly, we did not find ourselves to be 
heavily reliant on water resources (groundwater, surface water, 
water quality) in our own operations, and there were no significant 
issues around our operations in water-stressed regions.

However, our business activities can also impact biodiversity in 
other areas of our value chain – particularly with our suppliers at 
the start of the chain. This is why our suppliers must also comply 
with our environmental principles. We verify this regularly during 
our on-site social audits. And we have formulated it as a require-
ment in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
We also drew up a statement in 2022 specifying how we contrib-
ute to conserving biodiversity and protecting forests from clear-
ance activities. This statement sets out the measures we are 
implementing to this end along our value chain. This includes our 
approach to sustainable purchasing, our climate strategy, and our 
practice of taking aspects of biodiversity into account in our net-
work build-out work.
Moreover, we have taken on the role of nature sponsor during the 
period under review and are working as part of the Magenta Blos-
som project to help conserve and promote biodiversity. Flowering 
islands, as they are known, have been set up on an area over 40 
hectares in size to provide a home for bees, insects, and butter-
flies. Some 22 million wildflowers and herbs have grown in 
amongst 3.25 million sugar beets. This co-existence of agriculture 
and new habitats promotes biodiversity and improves soil quality.
We also cooperate with environmental and nature conservation 
organizations. Proceeds from our various cell-phone collection 
campaigns in Germany have so far benefited the following organi-
zations, among others: Pro Wildlife e.V.; Frankfurt Zoological Soci-
ety (projects for the protection of gorillas); and Hellabrunn Zoo, 
Munich (species protection projects).
The safety of the electromagnetic fields used in mobile communi-
cations is a publicly discussed issue. In 2023, the possible impacts 
of such fields on animals and plants continued to be debated. The 
Federal Office for Radiation Protection has determined that there 
is no scientific evidence that high-frequency fields below the legal 
limits endanger plant and animal life.
In the fight against climate change, we support international refor-
estation projects. Trees store CO₂, produce oxygen, regulate the 
water balance, provide a habitat for countless species, and thereby 
promote biodiversity. Many of our employees are actively involved 
in the Trillion Tree Campaign initiative, through efforts such as 
organizing tree-sponsorship donations or tree-planting campaigns. 
Thanks to this, the number of planted seedlings shown in our inter-
active tree counter keeps growing. We have now grouped the vari-
ous ongoing projects throughout the Group in our Magenta Forest 
campaign. One and all are welcome to participate in this campaign 
– by having trees planted, via an online site; making donations; or 
joining with others to plant trees in their local areas and have them 
registered, along with their geodata. In addition, we have asked our 
employees to use the Ecosia search engine for their internet 
searches wherever possible. Use of Ecosia contributes to global 
afforestation, and to our Magenta Forest: with the income it gener-
ates from search engine advertising, Ecosia plants trees in over 30 
countries, in cooperation with local organizations. In 2023, our 
Ecosia searches financed over 56 839 tree plantings. Our Green 
Pioneers ambassador program and our HR team took the initiative 
to set up the Magenta Pocket Forests, which sees our employees 
plant mini forests using the special Miyawaki method. Three of 
these small forests were planted at different locations in Germany 
during the year under review, comprising 1 000 trees in total, with 
more to follow. Together with the trees we planted ourselves as 
well as donated trees, our Magenta Forest grew by over 15 115 
trees in the year under review.
Information and communications technology (ICT) solutions form 
part of our portfolio of products and solutions that we use to drive 
pollution reduction efforts. For example, ICT solutions help to 
enhance transparency concerning water consumption and water 
management systems and to track animals as part of endangered 
species conservation efforts.
Land use 
The properties used by the Deutsche Telekom Group cover most of 
our demands for technology, office, common, call center, shop and 
storage space as well as providing space for other needs. Total 
take-up decreased slightly year-on-year, with a total of 11 226 389 
square meters in use.

Ecological product design
How can we make our products more sustainable and minimize 
their adverse environmental impacts throughout their entire life 
cycles? For each product, we begin answering this question very 
early on in the product’s development. Our Sustainability by 
Design Guidelines give product developers specific information on 
how to proceed. The guidelines cover such aspects as sustainable 
packaging, hazardous substances, and sustainability-oriented 
device development.
This approach is in line with our aim of continually improving and 
expanding our range of sustainable products. It also answers to the 
growing consumer demand for more-sustainable products for 
mobile and fixed-network communications.
Expansion of the Eco Rating
In 2021, working in cooperation with the telecommunications 
companies Orange, Telefónica, Telia Company, and Vodafone, we 
launched the Eco Rating initiative, a new sustainability-rating sys-
tem for cell phones. The calculation methodology for the Eco Rat-
ing was developed further in the year under review in response to 
changes in regulatory requirements and device features. There are 
now 11 network operators in total participating in the initiative. By 
the end of 2023, over 500 different cell phones from 23 different 
manufacturers had been evaluated based on the Eco Rating 
method. The purpose of the rating system is to provide consumers 
with consistent, precise information about cell phones’ environ-
mental impacts throughout their entire life cycles, i.e., throughout 
their manufacture, use, transport, and disposal. In the system, cell 
phones are evaluated on the basis of information provided by the 
manufacturers. The aspects taken into account include durability, 
reparability and recyclability, climate compatibility, and resource 
efficiency. With the system, we are improving transparency in the 
cell-phone industry and thereby helping to reduce its entire eco-
logical footprint. In addition, the Eco Rating system is expected to 
motivate device manufacturers to develop products that are even 
more sustainable. The label has already been introduced in 36 
countries worldwide since the initiative began, with launches cur-
rently taking place successively in further countries.
Ecological responsibility in procurement
We work closely with our suppliers in order to be able to offer envi-
ronmentally-friendly products. In a sustainable procurement strat-
egy that is valid throughout the Group, we have defined guidelines 
for our procurement processes.
Our principles in this area are also enshrined in various sets of rules 
and standards, such as our Supplier Code of Conduct and our pro-
curement guide (Leitfaden für den Einkauf). Our Global Procure-
ment Policy sets forth the sustainability criteria that apply to our 
Procurement unit. These criteria are taken into account throughout 
the entire procurement process.
In 2022, we refined specific sustainability criteria for IT and net-
work/hardware products, and for passive products, such as fiber-
optic cables. Building on this, we have worked closely with the tel-
ecommunications firm Orange to develop a harmonized set of 
product-based criteria. Since 2023, these criteria have been 
applied to invitations to tender with a budget of over EUR 10 mil-
lion for IT/NT hardware products and passive products, and, in 
conjunction with our supplier-based approach, feed into our sup-
plier selection process with a weighting of 20 percent. Particular 
importance is attached to the carbon footprint of our suppliers and 
their commitment to achieving ambitious climate goals; after all, 
the reduction of CO₂ emissions in our supply chain (Scope 3) plays 
a key role in achieving our goal of being climate-neutral by no later 
than 2040 along the entire value chain.
A number of instruments are used to monitor compliance with the 
standards stipulated in our Supplier Code of Conduct. Should we 
gain knowledge of infringements of standards as a result, then this 
may lead to sanctions for the suppliers concerned.
Green shop
Using more sustainable materials in our stores is an elementary 
component of our shop concept. In an initiative entitled Green 
Point of Sale, we have been bringing together sustainability-ori-
ented measures since 2021 that we are gradually rolling out at our 
1 425 shops in Europe. We use our #GreenMagenta sustainability 
label to make sustainability aspects and sustainable products and 
services in our stores visible to our customers. Overall, we are aim-
ing to apply sustainability criteria in the design and I of our shops 
throughout Europe. In 2021, we established a Europe-wide Green 
Point of Sale community to drive sustainability issues forward.
Germany segment
Using more sustainable materials in our stores is also a key com-
ponent of our shop concept in Germany. For instance, we use fur-
niture in our shops that has been manufactured locally. All decora-
tions and printed materials are made out of reboard (recyclable 
honeycomb cardboard), recycled polyester, or recycled ocean 
plastic. Paper consumption was also reduced by 85 percent in 
Germany as a result of measures such as digitalizing flyers.
The #GreenMagenta initiatives and sustainable topics are commu-
nicated in print and digital media at all shops in Germany. We also

run sustainability training events for our shop employees to equip 
them to provide more-specific sustainability-oriented advice to 
customers. Over 4 000 employees in Germany have already taken 
part in these events since 2019.
Europe segment
Since 2019, all new or renovated shops in the Europe segment use 
recyclable LED lamps. We also utilize sustainable, ecologically cer-
tified, organically sourced flooring in all our stores. Since 2019, 
green walls covered with living plants, also known as green walls/
green ceiling have been a firm feature of our international shop 
concept. By the end of 2023, we had installed over 120 green 
walls in various shops in Europe. We also introduced energy-saving 
screens and significantly reduced our paper consumption: paper-
less stores can already be found in Austria, Slovakia, and Greece. 
We have now cut paper consumption by 85 percent in Poland, 
Hungary, and Croatia, not least by opting not to offer printed bro-
chures and flyers in our shops. We offer digital invoices and online 
payment methods across the board at all national companies. In 
some of our flagship stores in Europe, we offer what we call repair 
bars, where we repair or replace displays, rechargeable batteries, 
and back covers of devices from several manufacturers. The 
#GreenMagenta initiatives and sustainable topics are already 
communicated in print and digital media at all shops in Austria. 
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary followed suit in 
summer 2023.
We also attach great importance to sustainability in the design of 
our company uniforms. Since January 2023, Telekom Shop 
employees in Germany have been wearing a new company uni-
form made from organic cotton and recycled polyester that has 
been certified in accordance with the Global Organic Textile 
Standard (GOTS). The GOTS defines internationally recognized 
requirements for organic textiles, from raw-material harvesting to 
environmentally-friendly and socially-responsible manufacture. 
Old company uniforms that are no longer required are recycled 
and turned into new items such as bags and hair bands.
Ecologically sustainable products
We are offering our customers a growing number of products and 
services that are sustainability oriented. These are based on 
Deutsche Telekom’s green network, which is powered entirely by 
renewable energies. We use the #GoodMagenta or #GreenMa-
genta labels to identify particularly sustainable products and solu-
tions. We also introduced the Eco Rating system in 2021, in coop-
eration with other network operators. With these labeling systems, 
we provide transparent information as to which smartphones and 
cell phones make positive contributions to environmental protec-
tion. We further expanded our range of sustainable products and 
services in 2023. In addition to sustainable devices, such as rout-
ers, media receivers, and the Fairphone, we also offer more sus-
tainable accessories. Additionally, our sustainable portfolio 
includes rental models and services for refurbishment and recy-
cling of smartphones and fixed-network devices.
First sustainable 5G smartphone
In 2021, we supported the launch of the first sustainable 5G 
smartphone in Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands through our 
partnership with Dutch manufacturer Fairphone. We consolidated 
this strategic partnership in the year under review, adding the Fair-
phone 5 to our product portfolio and marketing it from September 
2023.
Offers for business customers
We also want to help our business customers meet their sustaina-
bility goals and implement regulatory requirements – such as the 
EU Green Deal. In total, more than 16 customer solutions of T-Sys-
tems International and Telekom Deutschland have already 
received our #GreenMagenta label. More solutions are being 
added all the time, including the Digital Delivery Service (digital 
delivery note), which provides a means of making delivery pro-
cesses more efficient and sustainable. By choosing not to print 
physical documents, we save on valuable natural resources and 
reduce CO₂ emissions. Switching from a printed to a digital deliv-
ery note will allow us to save 7.7 metric tons of CO₂ and almost 6 
000 cubic meters of water a year for each million sheets of paper 
not used. In the food retail sector alone, 20 million delivery bills 
and thus over 180 million pages of paper can be saved. Addition-
ally, real-time communication and elimination of delays and docu-
ment losses help to minimize resource consumption, optimize pro-
cesses and reduce environmental impact along the supply chain. 
Another successful service from Telekom Deutschland to be 
awarded the #GreenMagenta label is the cell-phone purchase por-
tal for business customers. Together with the providers everphone 
and TKD, we also offer our business customers the Device as a 
Service model. We manage the entire device life cycle – including 
rental, active retrieval of devices from employees, replacement, 
and professional repair of defective devices, as well as certified 
disposal and subsequent recycling. Numerous other Deutsche 
Telekom offers, and numerous products of other manufacturers, 
help our customers reduce their carbon footprints. This is the case, 
for example, with the many home-office solutions we offer – and 
especially with our range of video- and web-conferencing systems. 
Deutsche Telekom customers benefit in this context from our 
extensive advisory and integration services, using which we aim to 
significantly increase efficiency in the use of these solutions.
Measuring progress with key performance indicators
We use various performance indicators to measure our progress in 
expanding our range of sustainable products. For example, we 
track the numbers of sustainable and refurbished devices in our 
mobile and fixed-network segments. We also specify the ratio of 
sustainable products sold and leased to total devices sold and 
leased. By 2023, more than 67 percent of our fixed-network 
devices sold and leased across the Group were sustainable.

Our strategy for climate-friendly mobility in Germany
Our strategy
Along with the use of environmentally friendly drive systems, the 
transition to climate-friendly mobility calls for expansion and sup-
port of the charging-station infrastructure and intelligent linking of 
new and existing forms of mobility. Our goal is to firmly establish 
the use of alternative forms of mobility within the Group and raise 
lasting awareness when it comes to individual decisions about 
particular means of transport. Beyond the efforts we are making to 
electrify our vehicle fleet, we are encouraging our employees to 
travel and commute in more-sustainable ways. All existing job 
ticket offers were ended on April 30, 2023 after an attractive alter-
native offer was launched on May 1, 2023 in the form of the 
Deutschlandticket.
Our mobility strategy rests on three pillars:
	
Diversified portfolio: building a more efficient, increasingly sus-
tainable fleet with climate-friendly drive systems and integrat-
ing micro-mobility (e.g., bicycles, e-scooters)
	
Digital services: pooling and sharing solutions, and Deutsche 
Telekom car app (digitalization of life cycle services)
	
Connected mobility: linking existing and new forms of mobility 
and mobility services with the help of a digital platform
Our vehicle fleet
From 2017 to 2023, we were able to reduce the CO₂ emissions of 
our vehicle fleet in Germany – which includes around 17 500 vehi-
cles – by about 35 000 metric tons. The main factors affecting the 
level of mobility-related CO₂ emissions are the average number of 
internal combustion vehicles, annual mileage, and the associated 
fuel consumption.
In January 2023, we introduced an internal requirement within 
Deutsche Telekom in Germany that we would only order company 
cars with electric drive systems going forward. This requirement 
has been applicable internationally for the Systems Solutions seg-
ment since 2022. On the basis of this, almost all of the company 
vehicles we ordered in Germany during the year under review had 
an electric drive, apart from just two exceptions that were covered 
by the policy. We have also extended the retention period for com-
pany vehicles from three to four years. However, the strained sup-
ply chain situation continues to result in unplanned delays to deliv-
eries of the electric vehicles we have ordered.
The process of fully electrifying our service vehicle fleet, which 
includes vehicles used by field service technicians, requires exten-
sive preparations. The requisite conditions for this have further 
improved in 2023, with a wider range of vehicles now being 
offered by car manufacturers in particular. Nonetheless, there is 
currently still a lack of small and large vans on the market that 
meet our requirements in terms of range. This is why we are so 
keen to drive the accompanying rollout of charging infrastructure. 
The necessary charging stations have already been installed at the 
first Deutsche Telekom locations with service vehicles. We are also 
striving to set up charging infrastructure at our technicians’ homes 
to enable them to set off to jobs straight from their doorstep with-
out any issues.
Our e-scooters
Some 300 e-scooters have been used by our service technicians 
and engineers since 2022 as part of our micromobility concept. 
These vehicles are used in a day-to-day work context for traveling 
short to medium distances, for instance, to set up internet connec-
tions for customers in urban conurbations with limited parking 
space. Other usage scenarios were tested in 2023 for projects 
requiring on-site visits, including providing assistance with the 
fiber-optic build-out in large cities such as Frankfurt am Main and 
with maintenance work on mobile communications antennas. 
Mobile antennas are installed along ICE high-speed-train lines, at 
major events, and in other locations where vehicular access is 
restricted.
Our bicycles
Since 2015, our salary sacrificing scheme has enabled our 
employees to give up some of their salary for resource-conserving 
and health-promoting bicycles or e-bikes, which they can lease 
from their employer for three years. The monthly payments are 
deducted from the employee’s gross salary, exempting them from 
tax payments on the purchase. Orders may be placed year-round 
via our external leasing partner, which, in addition to running its 
own online store, also has partnerships with local bicycle dealers. 
Over 10 000 bicycles are currently being leased via this scheme. 
Interconnecting transport services 
Interconnection between different modes of transport will become 
increasingly important in future. For this reason, we have been 
offering our Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platform and “goodride” 
app since 2023 as an alternative to single-person car use. This 
option combines various different modes of transport, including 
public transportation, privately shared vehicles and Deutsche 
Telekom vehicles (including services such as Shuttle on Demand 
and carsharing). MaaS will give our employees added convenience 
and flexibility in their commuting options. The goodride app and 
MaaS platform were developed by Telekom MobilitySolutions and 
Hacon, a Siemens subsidiary.

However, goodride is not only available to our employees – the 
application can also be downloaded from the major app stores by 
anyone in Germany. It allows users to navigate their way through 
the entire local public transport network in Germany The app can 
also be used to purchase the Deutschlandticket as well as all local 
public transport tickets for the Cologne-Bonn metropolitan region. 
We intend to expand goodride on a gradual basis to offer the 
option of purchasing tickets for other metropolitan regions of Ger-
many. Currently, users throughout Germany can use TIER-scooters 
and, in many cities, nextbikes and taxis in conjunction with local 
public transport, booking the required ticket combination through 
the app. This service is set to be progressively expanded to include 
more mobility partners, regions, and third-party offerings.

Expansion of the e-mobility charging infrastructure
Cities, companies, and households alike are all benefiting from the 
expansion of the charging infrastructure for electric cars. It is a 
responsible course of action and facilitates the transformation 
towards sustainable, green mobility. The places where we live and 
work are becoming more modern, environmentally friendly and 
sustainable, increasing their appeal to us as residents and employ-
ees.
In order to drive progress on the e-mobility front, it is vital to put in 
place smart infrastructure. Deutsche Telekom has extensive exper-
tise and experience in the planning, procurement, construction 
and operation of charging stations, and it plans to use these 
strengths in the coming years to support the transition to e-mobil-
ity. In the process, it will look beyond its own immediate needs and 
offer complete infrastructure packages for customers.
For example, Deutsche Telekom will offer smart solutions for cities, 
regions, and companies seeking to install and operate charging 
infrastructure. As part of its complete-system approach, Deutsche 
Telekom will offer business customers a full range of services, 
including planning, construction, installation, and service/opera-
tion. In addition to hardware, the services also include software for 
operating the charging stations and carrying out customer man-
agement.
The company’s activities in this area are organized as follows:
Comfort Charge GmbH
Comfort Charge GmbH has been constructing and operating 
charging infrastructure at Deutsche Telekom locations nationwide 
since 2018.
We increased the number of Comfort Charge rapid charging sys-
tems to around 230 by the end of 2023. We narrowly missed our 
target of operating 250 such stations by the end of 2023 due to a 
number of factors, the primary ones being local construction 
delays, late approvals, or missing power connections, which pre-
vented us from setting up the remaining stations in 2023. These 
stations will be installed successively in 2024. Additionally, some 
600 charging systems for electric vehicles (service vehicles, com-
pany cars and employees’ cars) were set up and operated at 
Deutsche Telekom Group locations.
The fast-charging stations at these locations are available to the 
public. With the charging speed they offer, electric vehicles are 
able to add about 100 kilometers of range within 10 minutes.
Comfort Charge’s expertise as a charge point operator also bene-
fits the services provided by Deutsche Telekom's business cus-
tomer sales in this connection.
Deutsche Telekom’s Technical Service has been planning, installing 
and servicing charging infrastructure since 2010.
Our partners leverage the benefits of the quality service that 
Deutsche Telekom’s field service offers nationwide, which includes 
a range of e-mobility services provided at the customer’s site. 
More than 50 partners offer a range of e-mobility solutions with 
the assistance of Deutsche Telekom’s Technical Service. These 
include site-scouting services, as well as installation, troubleshoot-
ing, and maintenance of charging systems. Deutsche Telekom’s 
field service installed infrastructure for over 1 800 charging points 
in 2023. The company fulfilled more than 7 000 e-mobility orders 
in total and is also one of the largest service providers of charging 
solutions for private households, with over 25 000 service con-
tracts carried out overall throughout Germany. Our partners and 
customers across the nation include energy suppliers, electronics 
retailers, hardware and automotive manufacturers, and fleet-solu-
tion providers.
With its large technician workforce, and its high quality standards, 
Deutsche Telekom is well-placed to serve the growing nationwide 
demand for infrastructure solutions – and thereby make a valuable 
contribution to the transition to sustainable mobility.
Deutsche Telekom Geschäftskunden GmbH
Over the past year, Deutsche Telekom Geschäftskunden GmbH has 
also been helping to boost sustainability, by supporting its busi-
ness customers in addressing their various interests, roles, and 
goals in the area of e-mobility. As part of these efforts, it has 
installed more than 100 normal-charging stations (AC) and fast-
charging stations (DC) at public and non-public customer loca-
tions in Germany, in the framework of holistic, end-to-end solu-
tions including planning, construction, installation, service, and the 
necessary equipment and software.
E-mobility is also being promoted at our national companies: Our 
company in Croatia, for example, has been offering an app-based 
digital charging service for electric vehicles since 2020. Via the 
“espoTs” app, end users can search for and use charging stations. 
No subscription or contract is required. T-Mobile US is also invest-
ing in charging stations for electric cars at its locations. The 
national company in Hungary launched a pilot project in 2021 to 
determine availabilities in the area of electric cars and charging 
stations, with a view to adding more electric cars to its vehicle 
fleet in the future.

We measure our activities to promote greener mobility at 
Deutsche Telekom using various KPIs, and have been collecting 
data for them since 2020.
By operating 230 fast-charging stations in Germany, we were able 
to save over 326 metric tons of CO₂e. This is equivalent to the CO₂ 
emissions a car would emit in traveling about 1.93 million kilome-
ters.
Number of vehicles in the DT Group
The total number of vehicles at our company decreased with 
respect to the previous year. While the majority of our vehicles still 
have diesel engines, their share of our overall fleet decreased in 
the year under review. To accelerate our transition to greener 
mobility, we have intensified the expansion of our charging-station 
infrastructure. This has enabled us to increase the total number of 
our fleet vehicles with green alternatives to gasoline/diesel-pow-
ered engines by 27 percent, with respect to the corresponding fig-
ure in 2022.
The performance indicators for each segment and individual com-
pany are shown in the interactive performance-indicator tool in our 
company comparison. More information about our Green Car Pol-
icy, alternative engines, and our goals for climate-friendly mobility 
is available here .
Fuel consumption 
Total fuel consumption decreased by around 5 percent. For service 
vehicles, consumption fell by 7 percent, while for company cars it 
increased by 2 percent. The interactive benchmarking tool shows 
the figures for each national company.

Green Pioneers in Germany
Internal sustainability ambassadors around the world are dedi-
cated to promoting a sustainable corporate culture. With their 
efforts, they support implementation of our CR strategy.
The internal Green Pioneers ambassador program was launched in 
Germany in 2018. Its aim is to promote and expand responsible 
management and conduct among the workforce. Group Corporate 
Responsibility (GCR) creates suitable conditions for the Green Pio-
neers’ work. Community Management, which is part of GCR, 
organizes regular meetings to share information and experience, 
offers internal and external expert talks, and helps plan activities. 
The Green Pioneers community celebrated its fifth anniversary 
during the year under review. It used the opportunity to look back 
on what it had achieved and was congratulated personally by CEO 
Tim Höttges. As of the end of 2023, the Green Pioneers groups 
had about 2 167 members and subscribers on YAM UNITED (1 
665 in 2022). This shows a growing interest in the initiative and in 
Deutsche Telekom’s sustainability activities.
Depending on their location, interests and expertise, the Green 
Pioneers come together to form subject-related or regional hubs. 
They act as internal multipliers for change by motivating employ-
ees to get involved in numerous resource conservation campaigns, 
such as an exchange for office supplies, clothing exchange cam-
paigns, tree-planting and waste collection campaigns, and an 
internal company ride-sharing agency. There are now 335 Green 
Pioneers in Germany. Active at 53 locations and in 19 depart-
ments, they seek out improvement potential and initiate appropri-
ate measures. The Magenta Pocket Forests initiative, for example, 
was set up by HR teams and Green Pioneers. During the year 
under review, they planted mini forests comprising over 1 000 
trees in total at three Deutsche Telekom locations. On the initiative 
of the Green Pioneers, smart textile containers were installed at 
our locations in North Rhine-Westphalia to collect old company 
uniforms, worn-out jeans and cotton hand towels and put them 
back into circulation in the textile ecosystem. The upcycling con-
tainers use Internet of Things (IoT) technology and their contents 
are collected independently, thanks to fill-level sensors that send a 
notification to the Deutsche Telekom iCloud when they are ready 
to be emptied. This saves unnecessary trips and thus reduces car-
bon emissions and fuel consumption. The cotton textiles collected 
are sent on to be upcycled. In 2023, we collected 21 metric tons 
of clothing in our upcycling containers, and we saved 135 million 
liters of water and 335 metric tons of CO₂ as a result of our textile 
collection and recycling activities.
With a view to boosting our employees’ motivation and commit-
ment, we seek to offer them additional leeway and options for 
structuring their working lives, such as flexible work arrangements. 
In addition to their core activities, our employees can also gain 
cross-departmental experience and apply their knowledge and 
skills. For example, the Green Pioneers take advantage of these 
opportunities to work on sustainability activities. There is similar 
employee commitment to sustainability activities in the Europe 
segment: in the Good Cause Initiative, cell phones are collected for 
a good cause in cooperation with local NGOs and authorities.
Green employee networks in the Systems Solutions segment
There are also numerous employee initiatives aimed at sustainabil-
ity and environmental protection within the Systems Solutions 
segment, for example:
Green Magenta Forest – reforestation program 
(T-Systems Mexico)
 The local business unit of T-Systems in Mexico set up a reforesta-
tion program in 2023 as part of its climate change mitigation 
strategy. Together with the Corporate Reforestation Program, 
three different types of tree were planted in urban neighborhoods.
The aim is to do our bit to help preserve biodiversity and raise 
awareness about maintaining green spaces among the employees 
at T-Systems Mexico and local residents. As part of this project, 
they were provided with information on the importance of urban 
green spaces as well as how and what to plant. About 150 
employees got involved in the program in the reporting year and 
around one metric ton of CO₂ was captured in the first year of the 
program thanks to the trees planted.
Volunteer work as part of the European Week for Waste Reduc-
tion (T-Systems ITC Iberia)
As part of the European Week for Waste Reduction, T-Systems ITC 
Iberia employees had the opportunity to take part in a voluntary 
trash-pickup campaign in the Barcelona area. The aim was to show 
them how vital these kinds of joint sustainability initiatives are for a 
greener and more livable future. The campaign was carried out in 
collaboration with the Adecco foundation, which is dedicated to 
the integration of those with disabilities. In addition to T-Systems 
ITC Iberia employees and their families, there were also people 
with disabilities taking part in the initiative.

Our approach to digital participation (access, affordability, 
ability) and digital values 
As a provider of digital infrastructure, we run our operations based 
on the principle of digital responsibility. As society becomes 
increasingly digital, we at Deutsche Telekom are making strenuous 
efforts to ensure everyone can participate in the digital world and 
lead their lives alongside each other on the basis of democratic 
principles. That is why we are working to facilitate digital participa-
tion and promote democratic values in our digital society. To 
ensure we can achieve these objectives across our Group, we have 
anchored them as a key topic of our CR strategy. 
Digital technologies have spread through virtually every aspect of 
our society and are becoming increasingly important in both our 
professional and private lives. Even our very participation in soci-
ety is increasingly being conducted through digital media. In a 
society based firmly on equality of opportunity, everyone has 
access to the essential technology and digital products and ser-
vices. When people decide not to participate in the digital world, 
that should happen solely as the result of free choice – and not 
due to a lack of financial means or the requisite know-how, for 
example. 
If everyone is to have an equal opportunity to participate in the 
digital society, then the following conditions must be met – every-
one must have access to essential technology, products, and ser-
vices that they can afford under their financial circumstances. 
What’s more, everyone should be able to, and be prepared to, get 
involved in society on the internet and to do so in a responsible 
manner. Based on this vision, we see digital participation as having 
three dimensions:
Access
We are continuously building out our network to enable technical 
access. To this end, we also cooperate with partners – especially in 
more remote areas. Also, we are pressing ahead with the develop-
ment of equipment and products for various demographics. The 
“nora” Notruf App (“nora” emergency-call app), for example, which 
offers one-tap emergency calling – and is intended especially for 
people with hearing and speech impairments – is based on a pat-
ent of Deutsche Telekom. Making our products and services as 
accessible as possible is an increasingly important aspect of what 
we do. We drafted the Design for All guide in the reporting year. 
This guide is designed to ensure the needs of as many different 
people as possible are factored into the development of new prod-
ucts and services – in a way that goes beyond the legal obligations 
related to accessibility.
Affordability
Our range of rate plans includes plans for just about any budget. 
We also offer subsidized rates (only available in German), afforda-
ble smartphones and tablets, and reduced basic charges – for 
schools, for example. Through this approach, we are attempting to 
make access to the digital world affordable for all and are trying to 
drive forward digitalization in education. Further information can 
be found here.
Ability
We help people to navigate the internet safely, competently, and 
confidently and offer free, easy-to-understand, and entertaining 
materials and formats on the many and varied aspects of media 
literacy.
We promote digital participation based on these three factors by 
pursuing a wide range of projects and initiatives.
Besides our commitment to digital participation, we also cham-
pion democratic values in the digital world. These are more impor-
tant than ever in uncertain times such as these, dominated as they 
are by climate change, wars and conflicts in many parts of the 
world, the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation 
even in countries with otherwise stable currencies, and growing 
and novel cases of cybercrime. Those are just some of the exam-
ples of events that create a sense of uncertainty in society. Con-
spiracy theories, disinformation as a means of manipulating public 
opinion, and hate speech are all becoming increasingly prevalent. 
We stand for diversity, tolerance, equal opportunities, social cohe-
sion, and ultimately democratic values in our digital society. We 
pursue a wide range of projects and initiatives aimed at promoting 
democratic competence, opinion forming, and media literacy and 
we take a firm stance against manipulation, marginalization, and 
hate on the internet. 
We measure the impact of our activities throughout the Group 
with a set of three ESG KPIs. Since 2021, we have anchored our 
focus topics even more firmly in our KPIs:
	
The Community Contribution ESG KPI maps our commitment 
in terms of financial, human, and material resources.
	
The Reach – Focus Topics ESG KPI shows the number of peo-
ple and media contacts we have reached with our communica-
tion on our focus topics of “digital society” (with the subtopics 
“digital participation” and “digital values”) and “low-carbon and 
circular society.”

	
The Beneficiaries – Focus Topics ESG KPI shows the number of 
people who are benefiting from our commitment to the focal 
topics of “digital society” and “low-carbon and circular society.”
Our measures are also based on the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. We have listed the activities 
with which we are pursuing SDGs in an overview.
Digital participation through Design for All
We want to promote accessible and non-discriminatory access to 
our products and services so that people have even better, easier, 
and faster access to them. In this way, we are contributing to the 
access dimension of digital participation. We are striving to ensure 
our product development process is shaped by diversity by factor-
ing in differing physical and mental abilities as well as other types 
of diversity such as age, gender, ethnic origin, and nationality. In 
adopting this approach, we are going beyond the legal obligations 
related to accessibility. We believe that Design for All is an oppor-
tunity for every one of us to be able to achieve maximum partici-
pation in the digital world. 
As early as 2009, Deutsche Telekom MMS GmbH founded a com-
petence center for accessibility and software ergonomics that is 
now the biggest in Germany and provides professional consul-
tancy services to companies. To ensure our own products and ser-
vices contribute toward our aims, the Deutsche Telekom Board of 
Management decided in July 2022 to roll out the Design for All 
approach. During the reporting year, we then developed the 
Design for All guide and published it internally. Furthermore, we 
have started work on a matching training concept that will help 
our employees better grasp the principles of Design for All and 
help build awareness. This training concept is to be made available 
to all employees in the form of web-based training. In the report-
ing year, the competence center developed a “Design for All” audit 
that takes other diversity dimensions into account in addition to 
accessibility requirements. This helps companies to optimize their 
products for the most diverse target groups possible.
To ensure all activities within the scope of Design for All take 
account of affected individuals and relevant stakeholders, we also 
set up a Sounding Board in the reporting year. This panel includes 
both internal experts and external representatives of organizations 
that work primarily on aspects of diversity that are relevant to the 
guide. The Sounding Board met for the first time in September 
2023.
Digital participation through media literacy
We view media literacy as the key to safe and competent interac-
tions with digital media and a crucial skill for our work and private 
lives. It begins with basic skills in using media and extends all the 
way to safeguarding privacy and dealing with hate and disinforma-
tion. Another aspect of media literacy that is important to us is the 
promotion of more sustainable approaches to technology and 
efforts to help people utilize digital solutions to protect biodiver-
sity, cut carbon emissions, and economize on resources. In this 
way, we are contributing to the ability dimension of digital partici-
pation.
“Teachtoday”
Our Teachtoday initiative supports children, young people, parents, 
and grandparents as well as teaching professionals with hands-on 
tips and materials about safe, proficient media usage. The materi-
als are available at www.teachtoday.de in seven languages (Ger-
man, English, Croatian, Montenegrin, Polish, Romanian, and Hun-
garian).
Digital learning plays a particularly important role now that digital 
schooling and remote learning have become an even bigger part 
of students’ day-to-day lives. The continually expanding digital 
toolbox, which was published in 2020 and now comprises over 
140 different formats, including product ideas, video tutorials, and 
fascinating quizzes, is designed for adults who have contact – 
either in schools, in learning groups, or in their own private lives – 
with children and young people between the ages of 9 and 16. 
The Teachtoday Academy, meanwhile, is a platform for adults who 
want to expand their knowledge and skills in various areas of digi-
tal education. During the reporting year, we carried forward our 
successful #TAKEPART stories in the Teachtoday Academy. These 
stories center on a practical approach to socially relevant aspects 
of digitalization and were made available to all as new interactive 
learning formats. 
We take a holistic view of sustainability and therefore utilize Teach-
today not just to promote social cohesion but also to raise aware-
ness of issues such as the climate, biodiversity, and the circular 
economy. In 2023, Teachtoday called on children and young peo-
ple to participate in the Europe-wide “Off to the umbels” challenge 
and heighten their awareness of biodiversity. The initiative aimed 
to encourage participants to use their smartphones to engage 
with the environment around them, discover the crucial role 
played by insects, and play their part in protecting both. 
Teachtoday also has its own YouTube channel (only available in 
German), on which it presents short, catchy videos about safe, pro-
ficient internet use, along with complete workshops on subjects 
such as how to use the toolbox.
“SCROLLER”
SCROLLER, an online magazine for children aged 9 to 12, teaches 
media literacy using age-appropriate language. Thanks to its inter-
active web format, the magazine has a completely up-to-date look 
and feel, and it is suitable, as a learning and reading tool, both for 
solitary use and for group exercises. Via the additional SCROLLER 
EDU+ area, which links directly with the magazine’s features, 
teachers can access background information and learning 
resources for classroom and online instruction. The first edition in 
2023, “Artificial Intelligence”, focused on a responsible and crea-
tive approach to using artificial Intelligence (AI) and provided 
insights into the opportunities that AI already offers us. This edition 
also flagged the challenges that AI can bring, such as disinforma-
tion, bias in programming, and breaches of privacy and copyright 
law. The second edition in 2023 “Digital.Nachhaltig.Gestalten.“ 
(“Digital.Sustainable.Design.”) took sustainability as its main 
theme.

Both the Teachtoday portal and SCROLLER won multiple awards in 
the reporting year. 
“AwareNessi – the fantastic security activity book”
“AwareNessi – the fantastic security activity book” from Deutsche 
Telekom is a magazine aimed primarily at children aged 8 to 14, 
but its playful and entertaining approach also explains the dangers 
of the internet to the adults in their lives. AwareNessi aims to high-
light how important it is to protect your data and be respectful to 
each other online. Issues of this magazine on how to safely handle 
information and data are available in up to 16 languages, which 
shows that Deutsche Telekom is sharing these vital insights across 
a variety of countries.
“DIGITAL@School”In our Group-wide DIGITAL@School initiative 
and corporate community, we help children take an active, self-
reliant role in shaping the digital age. Some 750 DIGITAL@School 
volunteers are giving their time to schools, and other educational 
institutions, in a range of in-person and online assistance formats. 
With age-appropriate approaches, they are helping to inspire chil-
dren to take an interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering, 
mathematics) subjects and in programming languages. In addi-
tion, they teach skills that children need in order to use digital 
media responsibly. DIGITAL@School also supports Germany’s 
Girls’Day initiative, which is aimed specifically at girls at secondary 
school, and stages workshops that are run by employees on this 
special day.  
In 2023, the corporate volunteers of the DIGITAL@School commu-
nity held a total of 79 events. These ranged from one-off and regu-
lar workshops in regional educational establishments to large-
scale events such as the DIGITAL@School Campus in Bonn that 
attracted up to 3 000 visitors over two days in November. The 
overarching goal of these events was to offer young people a fun 
opportunity to find out more about robotics, programming, media 
literacy, and digital technologies. They also gave participants a 
chance to try out creative ways of using artificial intelligence (AI). 
In total, more than 9 000 children, adults, and educators took part 
in DIGITAL@School events. The efforts of our corporate volunteers 
in the reporting year were also recognized with the Telekom Team 
Award in the “Act with respect and integrity” category. 
What’s more, DIGITAL@School has been given the #GoodMa-
genta label for its social commitment. The initiative was launched 
in 2017 as IT@School. It then grew throughout the Group, and was 
renamed DIGITAL@School at the end of 2021.  
Deutsche Telekom Stiftung’s commitment
The educational foundation Deutsche Telekom Stiftung is working, 
via numerous programs and projects, to help improve education in 
STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathemat-
ics). It supports children and young people aged 6 to 18 in learn-
ing important skills for life both in and out of school. Along with 
STEM-related skills, the skills in question include critical thinking, 
good judgment and discernment, creativity, and communication 
and teamworking skills. The foundation provides such support out 
of the conviction that a modern education system must give 
young people the best possible preparation for meeting global 
challenges such as digital transformation, climate change, electro-
mobility, and biodiversity.
“Digital Crime – Auf digitaler Spurensuche” podcast
We have been publishing our podcast series “Digital Crime – Auf 
digitaler Spurensuche” (Digital Crime – On the digital trail) on all 
well-known podcast channels since 2021. While the first two sea-
sons feature people talking about the hate they have encountered 
in the digital world, the third and fourth seasons explore all aspects 
of cybersecurity and cybercrime by focusing on real-life cases. Lis-
teners are also given helpful tips and tricks for dealing with cyber-
attacks of all types.
Collaboration to promote digital competence
In 2023, Deutsche Telekom once again participated in Digitaltag 
(Digital Day) with a range of campaigns and as a partner. Digi-
taltag is part of the Digital für alle (Digital for Everyone) initiative, 
which focuses on the issue of how everyone in Germany can get a 
better understanding of digital developments and benefit from 
them. Digitaltag uses a whole range of formats to explain what 
digitalization is and really bring it to life for people. The event took 
digital skills as its main theme in the reporting year and was held 
under the slogan “Digitalisierung: Entdecken. Verstehen.” (Digitali-
zation: Discover. Understand.). We contributed in a number of 
ways, such as by staging an interactive Teachtoday online work-
shop on “AI for all” that highlighted the risks and potential of AI and 
by organizing a live link-up to the workshops of the Deutsche 
Telekom Seniors’ Academy, where seniors can take a deeper dive 
into the digital world. Moreover, we joined the Digital für alle initia-
tive on its search for innovative AI projects in 2023 and presented 
a public award for digital social cohesion in the special category of 
AI and Democracy. The award recognized projects that contribute 
to an inclusive and responsible digital future while also strength-
ening democratic principles. 
We also cooperate with various universities, with a view to sup-
porting current research and promoting digital literacy. For exam-
ple, via Telekom Laboratories (T-Labs), we finance several 
endowed chairs at TU Berlin which are oriented to the teaching of 
digital topics. Additional information on research and development 
is available here.
In addition, we are working, in cooperation with the German 
National Association of Senior Citizens’ Organisations (BAGSO) and 
the Deutsche Seniorenliga (German Seniors’ League; only available 
in German) to promote media literacy among seniors and have 
lent our support as a partner to the Goldener Internetpreis (Golden 
Internet Prize; only available in German), which has been pre-
sented since 2012. The prize is awarded to committed individuals, 
initiatives, and municipalities that are working to inspire seniors to 
go online – and to assist them in doing so. In another effort in this 
context, we serve on the advisory board of Digital-Kompass (only 
available in German), a joint project of BAGSO and the association 
Deutschland sicher im Netz e.V. (DsiN – Germany secure online). 
Digital-Kompass provides resources and digital “round table” 
meeting formats for internet guides who help seniors navigate the

online world. In addition to our online activities, we also organize 
offerings locally. Within the framework of the Deutsche Telekom 
Seniors’ Academy, for example, we hold seminars and workshops 
on using digital devices. Through these events, we aim to make it 
easier for interested seniors to start to explore the digital world by 
showing them empathy, passing on skills, and making the whole 
process fun.

Digital values
As we move toward a digital society, we are making strenuous 
efforts to ensure everyone can participate in that society and live 
together on the basis of democratic principles. We run a diverse 
range of campaigns, initiatives, and projects to promote demo-
cratic values such as diversity, tolerance, equal opportunities, and 
social cohesion. We also speak out loud and clear against the 
manipulation of public opinion, marginalization, and hate speech 
on the internet. We work closely with non-governmental organiza-
tions in these areas and are constantly aware of the special protec-
tion that needs to be afforded to children as we shape a digital 
society that is based on democratic principles.
United against hate speech
Our No Hate Speech initiative, which we launched in Germany in 
the summer of 2020, continued in 2023. Through this initiative, we 
aim to raise awareness in society and enable people to put into 
practice and defend fundamental democratic values online. We 
are advocating for an internet in which everyone can utilize the 
opportunities of the digital world – without having to fear margin-
alization or hate speech.
During the reporting year, this initiative centered on the theme of 
“No hate speech – we decide!” According to a recent Forsa study, 
the proportion of users who have encountered hate speech on the 
internet has stayed at a consistently high level of 76 percent over 
the last five years. However, only one in four users has ever 
responded actively and critically to a hateful comment with what 
is known as counterspeech. In our TV advertisement, which has 
been broadcast since July 2023, we show what even just one sin-
gle positive comment against hate speech on the internet can 
achieve. By making our own contributions and supporting those 
targeted by hate speech, we can make a clear decision to act 
against hate speech on the internet. Our TV advertisement was 
supported by partners including #ichbinhier (I am here), HateAid, 
Freunde fürs Leben (Friends for life), and Nummer gegen Kummer 
(a counseling helpline).
We also participated in a joint campaign with FC Bayern München 
in the reporting year. This included two TV advertisements that 
depicted realistic hate comments and called for a stronger stance. 
Also, with our own measures aimed at online civil courage, we call 
on society to support us in this commitment. 
In 2023, as part of the No Hate Speech campaign, we also worked 
with the esports player foundation to develop the FIFA Fairplay 
Guide. This compact guide sets out all the key rules regarding fair-
ness and sporting spirit in the FIFA PC and console game. The 
objectives and rules of the guide were drawn up by the FIFA com-
munity in a process that included three public live streams with 
various big-name players, content creators, and streamers from 
the industry. In addition to covering how players should conduct 
themselves in certain game scenarios, the guide also addresses 
basic principles for dealing with hate speech and abuse on the 
internet.
Besides calling on society to take a stand, our initiative also 
assigns a great deal of importance to supporting those who are 
affected by these issues. Furthermore, we support other initiatives 
that specifically oppose marginalization and we cooperate with 
NGOs that work toward our goal of strengthening democracy and 
coexistence amid diversity. We showcase a number of these initia-
tives and organizations in our Topic special. 
In partnership with the #ichbinhier (I am here; only available in 
German) association, we run various workshops about online civil 
courage that are aimed at promoting a more constructive 
approach to communication on digital platforms. Participation in 
the workshops is open to everyone. In the reporting year, we 
placed a special emphasis on  civil courage online in the face of 
hate targeted specifically at people who are perceived to be 
female and at climate activists. In addition to these workshops, 
Deutsche Telekom also commissioned #ichbinhier to provide train-
ing during the reporting year to full-time and voluntary communi-
ties such as cultural institutions, conservation initiatives, charities, 
and sports associations.
In 2023, our No Hate Speech initiative generated approximately 
865 million media contacts and reached 5.7 million people either 
directly or through opinion leaders such as parents and educators 
(for instance, through workshops). The total number of people 
reached in 2022 was four million. We also once again received 
multiple awards for No Hate Speech in the reporting year. 
Furthermore, it is important to us that No Hate Speech has a high 
profile both outside and inside our company. That is why we 
worked with the Business Council for Democracy (BC4D) in the 
reporting year to run a training course for 25 opinion leaders from 
various parts of the Group. Among others, representatives from the 
Customer Service, Training, and Communications departments, 
from the Works Council, and from corporate communities such 
as DIGITAL@School and Green Pioneers took part. Eight training 
units were staged that dealt with the topics of hate speech, dis-
information, and conspiracy theories on the internet. The aim of 
the training was to enable participants to take an active role them-
selves and disseminate what they had learned about the issues 
throughout the company.

ShareWithCare
In 2023, when it ran its ShareWithCare campaign, Deutsche 
Telekom joined an international debate about sharing photographs 
of children online. The campaign generated more than 250 million 
media contacts with its fictitious story about Ella, which portrayed 
a very real problem known as “sharenting.” This term (a mix of 
“sharing” and “parenting”) refers to the posting of photos and vid-
eos of children in social networks. Internet users who do this could 
unintentionally expose children to the risk of profiling by data bro-
kers, hacking, facial recognition, pedophile crimes, and other pri-
vacy and security threats. However, only very few people are aware 
of these dangers. This was illustrated in a recent survey with par-
ents of children aged between 0 and 14 carried out on behalf of 
Deutsche Telekom. Through ShareWithCare, we aim to raise 
awareness of the need to protect photographs of children and 
their personal data on the internet and to provide assistance in 
doing just that. We support parents by providing further informa-
tion through Teachtoday and with the aid of our partner DsiN  
(Germany secure online). In the reporting year, we published a 
guide entitled “Kinder sicher im Netz” (Keeping children safe on 
the internet) in collaboration with DsiN to provide information 
about digital rights for children, risks, and how to stay safe online. 
Find out more about digital youth protection here. 
#equalesports
During the reporting year, we also continued our commitment to 
promoting civil courage and constructive dialog on gaming plat-
forms. Together with the esports organization SK Gaming and the 
esports player foundation, we launched the initiative #equales-
ports in 2021 to promote greater diversity in esports and gaming. 
The initiative aims to support the participation of women and non-
binary people, who are particularly frequent targets of hostility, in 
professional and amateur sports. In September 2023, we also 
worked with both partners to stage the third Equal eSports Festi-
val, once again as part of the DIGITAL X trade fair in Cologne. Held 
over two days, the festival addressed diversity, esports, and digital 
education in workshops, panel discussions, and other event for-
mats. The highlight of our #equalesports activities in the reporting 
year was the Equal eSports Cup. This tournament took place over a 
number of months, with the final being staged at the festival. It 
was aimed at all female and non-binary players.

United States segment: digital equity
T-Mobile US fundamentally believes that access to connectivity 
and the digital skills to navigate our world have become two of the 
most important differentiators of societal equity today. That’s why 
the segment is empowering people with the essential connec-
tions, tools, and skills needed to succeed in today’s digital world. 
Digital empowerment is also a key focus area of the ESG approach 
at T-Mobile US.
Access and affordability
T-Mobile US built its network to deliver the best 5G experience 
while providing affordable options to families in order to support a 
more connected, equitable future. In today’s digital world, being 
disconnected presents unfair hurdles and roadblocks to everyday 
life. T-Mobile US has addressed this critical issue by making signifi-
cant investments in programs and initiatives that make connectiv-
ity more accessible and affordable. It also invests in essential digi-
tal equity and literacy programs with various communities and 
organizations. 
Project 10Million
Project 10Million is a USD 10.7 billion commitment by T-Mobile 
US to help end the digital divide in education. This program was 
launched in 2020 and provides free Internet service and free 
mobile hotspots to under-connected households with school-aged 
children. The aim is to offer up to 10 million eligible households. In 
2023, T-Mobile US once again worked with school districts, extra-
curricular programs, and local communities to offer free and 
affordable Internet access to connect schools and students 
nationwide. As a result of its education initiatives, T-Mobile US had 
connected over 5.8 million students through the end of 2023.
T-Mobile US works to leverage local and national partnerships with 
organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, to pro-
mote awareness of the program and to simplify registration.
5G access for all
Developed in partnership with Google, the T-Mobile US REVVL line 
provides customers with affordable and feature-packed 5G smart-
phones. In 2023, the company also introduced a tablet to its 
REVVL lineup for the first time. The devices provide a budget 
option to help make 5G accessible on a broad scale.
Connecting our Heroes
The 10-year commitment by T-Mobile US provides free service 
and 5G access to first responder agencies – all public and non-
profit state and local fire, 911, police and EMS departments –  
creating huge savings for participating agencies.
Extending a welcome to refugees with Welcome.US
In early 2022, T-Mobile US’ Mike Sievert joined 35 other CEOs to 
form the Welcome.US CEO Council. This public/private partner-
ship provides refugees being resettled in the US with products, 
services, job training, and employment opportunities. As a part of 
this partnership, T-Mobile US pledged to contribute up to 200 000 
lines of free, unlimited talk, text, and data for one year to incoming 
refugees, from a growing number of countries, including Afghani-
stan and Ukraine.
Europe segment: initiatives for digital participation and digital 
values
The Europe segment comprises a variety of national companies, 
only some of which are mentioned here as examples. Together, 
they reach a number of different target groups with a diverse 
range of initiatives aimed at contributing to a digital society that 
everyone can participate in based on democratic principles.

As part of the Netrevalok (be now generation) program, our Hun-
garian company Magyar Telekom organizes digital education 
courses at a total of 24 libraries. At these sessions, middle-grade 
students help people from older generations come to grips with 
digital tools. 
In Austria, the Magenta Telekom project ConnectedKids has been 
bringing the topic of the digital future into the classroom for 10 
years. Over a period of six weeks, participating schools are given 
free tablets, educational apps, mobile internet, and support staff. 
Since early 2013, a total of 290 schools have registered for the 
scheme and 30 000 students from 1 500 classes have taken part.
Children and young people are also being trained in the use of dig-
ital tools in Croatia, thanks to the Generation NOW program. The 
aim of this program is to introduce young people to new types of 
education so they can develop their creativity and innovation with 
state-of-the-art technology. As part of the Generation NOW pro-
ject, Hrvatski Telekom and IRIM, an institute for youth develop-
ment and innovation, have established the country’s biggest edu-
cational project for the Internet of Things. So far, more than 500 
mentors have been trained who will share their know-how with 
new generations of school-age children year after year.
Our Montenegrin company is providing free 1 Gbit/s internet 
access to the University of Montenegro. This means that staff and 
students from all faculties, institutes, and university departments 
can share data and information effortlessly as part of a larger aca-
demic network. 
As part of the ENTER digital education program, Slovak Telekom 
has launched a support program called “Ready for the digital age” 
that focuses on developing digital literacy among senior citizens. It 
covers subjects like using smartphones and computers, digital 
communications, and teaching of programming skills.
A similar initiative in the Czech Republic is also aimed at seniors. In 
collaboration with partner NGOs, digital education is being 
brought to people at roadshows staged all across the country in 
businesses, public buildings, and community centers. Telekom 
Shop assistants from our national company are helping out as 
coaches. A website designed especially for seniors has also been 
created.
In Greece, the non-profit organization for educational robotics and 
science, WRO Hellas, entered a strategic collaboration with COS-
MOTE to stage the National STEM & Educational Robotics 2023 
competition in the first half of 2023. At the final, more than 1 200 
elementary and secondary-school students showcased automa-
tion and technology solutions for an environmentally friendly and 
people-friendly smart city. It was the ninth time in a row that the 
national competition had been staged, and it was held under the 
patronage of the Greek President.
Various national companies in the Europe segment implemented 
their own activities as part of the Group-wide No Hate Speech ini-
tiative.
For example, the foundation Telekom for Macedonia joined with 
UNICEF to run the “Together for a hate-free internet” (No hate 
speech youth) campaign. Its aim is to encourage young people to 
be respectful and friendly to each other in online communities by 
staging workshops that teach participants how to deal with prob-
lems. The young people also created a campaign to raise aware-
ness among their peers and the general public. Events were led by 
specialists in media literacy and technology experts among others.
Online hate is also becoming an ever-greater problem in Poland, 
and is having a negative impact on mental health, particularly 
among Generation Z. Our national company therefore launched an 
education campaign with the foundation Sexed.pl. The aim is to 
give Generation Z the tools and knowledge they need to counter-
act hate, and to show that it pays to share positive feedback, both 
in life in general and online. 
T-Mobile Czech Republic is providing financial support for 
schemes designed to support those affected by hate speech. In 
2023, it started working with In IUSTITIA, a non-profit organization 
that provides legal and social aid to those affected by hate crimes. 
T-Mobile CZ has provided financial support for the victim advice 
unit run by In IUSTITIA, and both partners are promoting a cam-
paign entitled “Flaw in the law” that is highlighting the lack of legal 
protection for people who have been the target of hate crimes. In 
November 2023, T-Mobile CZ also announced a funding procedure 
to provide access to funds worth a total of 1.5 million Czech 
koruna to organizations that support groups threatened by vio-
lence due to prejudice. Applications for funding can be submitted 
by non-profit and aid organizations, but informal groups and uni-
versities are also welcome to apply.
ESG KPIs: Community Contribution, Reach - Focus Topics, 
and Beneficiaries – Focus topics
And to measure the effectiveness of our commitment in relation to 
the focus topics of “digital society” and “low-carbon and circular 
society” we report a set of three ESG KPIs: Community Contribu-
tion, Reach – Focus Topics, and Beneficiaries – Focus Topics. In 
using these KPIs, we rely on methods employed by the organiza-
tion Business for Societal Impact (B4SI), which incorporate the 
aspects “input,” “output,” and “impact.” In 2021, we anchored our 
focus topics even more firmly in our KPIs. Initiatives from the “vol-
untary and financial commitment” category also come under the 
ESG Social KPIs.
Community Contribution
The Community Contribution ESG KPI encompasses activities in 
which Deutsche Telekom was involved in the community either 
financially, through its employees, or through the donation of 
materials. Between 2017 and 2020, this input was termed “Com-
munity Investment.” In 2021, the KPI was modified and its focus 
tightened.

Our ambition in this connection: Increase the KPI
In 2023, we dedicated around 98 percent of our commitment to 
the focus topic of “digital society.” Around 2 percent was put 
toward other issues such as our focus topics “low-carbon and 
circular society” and “disaster management.”
Besides the longer-term commitment to our focus topics of 
“digital society” and “low-carbon and circular society” (social 
investments), we also contribute through donations to charity and 
social sponsorships (e.g., for cultural events).
To calculate our commitment in terms of our staff, we look at the 
volunteering hours that our employees have contributed during 
their working hours as part of our Corporate Volunteering scheme. 
In 2021, we adjusted the basis for calculation and now include 
both volunteering hours contributed during working hours and vol-
unteering hours that we support in other ways (e.g., by providing 
venues, insurance policies, or donations). For example, during the 
reporting year, our employees volunteered at the Special Olympics 
World Games 2023 in Berlin. Throughout the Group, our employ-
ees contributed 179 463 volunteering hours in 2023.
Also, efforts we make in the context of the Community Contribu-
tion ESG KPI contribute significantly toward achievement of the 
Sustainable Development Goals. In 2023, approximately 1 470 
million euros of our Group-wide Community Contributions went 
toward promoting the digital society and therefore helped deliver 
SDG 4 (Quality Education) (2022: 2 331 million euros). A particular 
effect in 2022 was our support for Ukrainian refugees in the form 
of free or heavily discounted telecommunications services (550 
million euros in Germany). We continued to offer telecommunica-
tions services at lower-cost rates in 2023, albeit to a lesser extent 
(24 million euros in Germany).
Reach – Focus topics
The Reach – Focus Topics ESG KPI indicates the number of people 
reached and media contacts generated through our messaging on 
our focus topics of “digital society” and “low-carbon and circular 
society.” It therefore shows how many people have been made 
aware of the topics and our activities. At the end of 2023, we 
recorded a total of approximately 1 734 million people and media 
contacts, which represents a reduction compared to the previous 
year (2022: 2 070 million). This was primarily due to the fact that 
fewer initiatives contributed to the ESG KPI Reach - Focus Topics 
in the reporting year and therefore projects with a particularly 
large reach in the previous year were not included in 2023.
Our ambition in this connection: Increase the KPI

Beneficiaries – Focus topics
The Beneficiaries – Focus Topics ESG KPI shows the number of 
people who have benefited from our commitment to promoting a 
digital society and low-carbon and circular society (e.g. media-lit-
eracy training, broadband access for schools, and supporting 
counseling hotlines). In 2023, approximately 51 million people 
benefited from our activities (2022: 41 million). In contrast to the 
period from 2017 to 2020, only beneficiaries of the “digital soci-
ety” and “low-carbon and circular society” focus topics have been 
taken into account since 2021. In addition to recording direct ben-
eficiaries, we also take into account indirect beneficiaries in line 
with a set key, such as when an opinion-leader concept is being 
applied or when a discounted connection is being used by several 
people.
Our ambition in this connection: Increase the KPI
Our aim is to grow the ESG KPI Beneficiaries – Focus Topics. The 
following graphic maps out the historical development of this KPI 
and our international target level.
Our investments in network expansion are making an important 
contribution to facilitating broadband access for large sections of 
the public. Further information on our approach to infrastructure 
expansion can be found here.

numbers of qualified applicants for vocational training careers and study 
programs in STEM fields are to be significantly increased – with a view to 
safeguarding our future prosperity – we need to be looking at all potential 
sources of talent, and working to eliminate barriers to learning and education. 
The MINT Zukunft schaffen (STEM – Creating the future) initiative is working to 
quantitatively and qualitatively improve teaching and learning in STEM subjects 
at schools and universities. In addition, it is promoting digitalization in education, 
and honoring schools that emphasize STEM education.

people, parents, teachers, and the wider public form positive opinions of STEM 
fields and their potential. Deutsche Telekom AG is one of the initiative’s founding

hearing-impaired persons who are unable to use sign language, and 
who constantly face communication barriers as a result. To address 
this issue, staff in all of T-Mobile Czech Republic’s shops are equipped 
with a mobile-phone app for online speech transcription. In addition, 
T-Mobile Czech Republic’s Infoline is now fully accessible thanks to 
speech transcription. With the help of financial support from T-Mobile 
Czech Republic, these services are being provided by a socially oriented 
company that employs visually impaired typists.

Telekom Seniors’ 
Academy
Group
The Telekom Seniors’ Academy works to assist older people in going online 
and in using digital devices such as tablets. Since March 2022, we have 
offered seminars and workshops, run by competent, empathetic and 
lively staff, that help seniors navigate the online world and have fun in the 
process. This effort is based in large measure on the efforts of the German 
National Association of Senior Citizens’ Organisations (BAGSO), including 
pertinent cooperation and a newsletter, as well as on support provided by 
the association Wege aus der Einsamkeit e.V. (“Getting in touch with other

Generations 
Together
Europe
Generations Together is a digital education program launched in 
cooperation with Zagreb’s Center for Volunteer Work. It is aimed at helping 
senior citizens acquire useful digital skills. It was developed in response to 
the coronavirus pandemic, which hit senior citizens hardest – especially 
those living in retirement and nursing homes, since they were unable to 
receive visits from family members during the pandemic.  
 
As part of its efforts for seniors over the past few years, Hrvatski Telekom 
has donated tablets, provided free internet access, and organized computer 
courses to help seniors learn to use digital tools such as WhatsApp for video 
calls. 
 
In addition to teaching seniors about basic, widely used tools, the courses 
presented a range of other useful and interesting apps, as well as related 
skills such as updating of devices.

Network of 
Generations
Europe
Most of Poland’s seniors still do not use the internet. Over half of the 
country’s people between the ages of 65 and 74 (54.4 percent) have never 
even used a computer, while a full 71.2 percent of Poland’s seniors do not 
use the internet at all. Only about one fifth of the country’s people aged 60 
and older (21.4 percent) use the internet regularly. In addition, institutions 
such as retirement and nursing homes face considerable problems in 
getting up to speed with online resources. T-Mobile Polska considers this 
situation to be unacceptable and has developed the Network of Generations 
initiative in order to address it. Within the space of two years, T-Mobile 
Polska has already equipped over 30 seniors’ institutions with laptops and 
provided free, specially designed video courses that show seniors, step-by-
step, how to use modern digital devices and online resources. The company 
has also designed a special website (www.siecpokolen.pl) that provides 
training materials. In addition, the entire campaign is being supported by an 
outreach in media used by seniors.

telecommunications companies. It supports companies that focus 
primarily on social concerns. The companies in question use information 
technologies to support efforts toward one of the UN’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG). 
 
This initiative of T-Systems Mexico is being supported by leading 
companies in the IT and digital-technology sector. The project is designed 
to identify and support socially motivated, technologically competent 
companies, for the purpose of developing solutions oriented to a new, 
inclusive, accessible, and increasingly digital reality. The digital solutions 
involved are expected to advance equality in participation in society and 
help to close social and economic gaps. The digitally oriented companies 
being funded in the CODIGOS framework are helping to address some of 
the country’s most-urgent social challenges. 
 
CODIGOS is working to identify and support entrepreneurs and startups 
that are applying their energies, expertise, and creativity to socially 
motivated digital projects in the areas of health, education, employment, 
sustainability, renewable energies, industry, innovation, infrastructure, 
equal-opportunity participation, and finance, all with the aim of helping the 
weakest members of society.

Our approach to voluntary and financial commitment
Further to our strategic focus topics, we also support additional 
educational, cultural, sporting, and health initiatives. Besides 
implementing our own projects and initiatives, another aspect of 
our social commitment involves encouraging our employees to 
pursue voluntary commitments. For example, we provide financial 
support for associations in which our employees are active. We 
also give our staff time off for volunteering. 
In addition, we provide financial support – for example, via dona-
tions to, and collaborative efforts with, non-profit organizations 
that work to promote more harmonious coexistence and combat 
marginalization.
We collaborate closely with our business segments across national 
borders, sharing experience and best practices. In many cases, we 
invite our national companies to regionally implement, under their 
own responsibility, initiatives that we launch centrally.
Our close collaboration with key figures in society such as non-
governmental organizations, associations, and initiatives also plays 
an important role. The reasons why we place priority on such inter-
action, across organizational and national boundaries, include the 
opportunities that it provides for mutual impetus and for the 
development of new ideas.
Sponsorships and corporate giving
In Germany, we are involved in the fields of sport, culture, and 
social issues. In addition to providing funding, we help artists, ath-
letes, event organizers, and associations with their communication 
and marketing activities. Our Sponsorship Policy provides the 
framework for sponsoring activities. Being involved in the regions 
where we are based is another important aspect. 
In the reporting year, Deutsche Telekom supported the Special 
Olympics World Games 2023 in Berlin as a premium partner. It is 
the biggest inclusive sport event in the world for athletes with 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. This partnership was a clear 
choice for us, as we share the organization’s values. After all, it is 
only when we all take part that social participation can truly work. 
For this reason, besides providing telecommunications services, 
we also contributed to the broadcast of the event.  To raise the 
profile of the World Games in the public eye, we joined forces with 
10 other major sports media companies to form an unprecedented 
media alliance. We provided entirely barrier-free access to con-
tent. As part of the German media alliance for the Special Olym-
pics World Games 2023 in Berlin, we won the HORIZONT SPORT-
BUSINESS AWARD as “Medium of the Year.”
We also published our first press release in simple language (only 
available in German) in January 2023 and aim to further promote 
linguistic participation, using our reach to raise awareness of this 
important issue.
Other examples of our financial commitment include:
	
Music sponsorship
	
Competitive sport sponsorship with partners such as the DFB 
(German Football Association), FC Bayern München, Telekom 
Baskets Bonn, and Deutsche Sporthilfe, DFB’s Sepp Herberger 
Foundation, and the German National Paralympic Committee
	
Technology partnerships with other soccer clubs in the German 
first and second leagues (Bundesliga 1 and 2)
	
Partnerships in the esports sector
	
Support for recreational and youth sport
	
Sponsorship of social activities within partnerships
	
Regional activities in the areas of classical music and culture
Additional information on the sponsorship activities of Deutsche 
Telekom AG is available here. 
Corporate giving
Through our corporate giving program, we support the work of aid 
organizations – preferably in the form of long-standing partner-
ships – and provide rapid assistance in disaster situations. Our 
Group Donation Policy lays out the guidelines for these activities.
Support for employee commitment 
Our corporate volunteering activities help our employees to con-
tribute to society by enabling them to donate their time and/or 
expertise to non-profit projects or social causes that extend 
beyond the company’s regular activities. Through their commit-
ment, our employees play a major role in strengthening social 
cohesion, while also broadening their own horizons, and boosting 
their skills. This in turn has a positive impact on teamwork at the 
company. 
For example, we offer our employees the option to participate in 
“social days,” when they can actively contribute to society and 
come together as a team to support non-profit organizations. 
Moreover, if they are volunteering in a non-profit organization

based in Germany, they can also apply for a donation of 200 euros 
to that organization once per year. 
Civil servants who are 55 or older also have the option to take early 
retirement if they commit to some form of active contribution to 
society during the first three years of their retirement. For example, 
they might spend 12 months working with the Bundesfreiwilligen-
dienst (German Federal Volunteers Service) or 1 000 hours with 
church, charity, or non-profit organizations.
Furthermore, in the reporting year, our employees were able to 
support the Special Olympics World Games 2023 in Berlin which 
were held under the motto #UnbeatableTogether. We gave our 
employees the opportunity to volunteer at the event, freeing them 
from their regular activities and providing accommodations in Ber-
lin. The placements we offered were taken up in a very short space 
of time, with a total of 110 Deutsche Telekom employees taking 
part as helpers. We value this as a strong sign of our employees’ 
readiness to contribute to society. In recognition of their commit-
ment, the 110 “Magenta volunteers” were presented with the 
internal Inclusion Award by the Group Representatives for Persons 
with Disabilities. 
Our employees also had the opportunity, once again, to volunteer 
for the yearly “Ein Herz für Kinder” children’s charity gala in the 
reporting year. In a drive to champion the focus topics of our CR 
strategy, many of our employees organized themselves in numer-
ous employee networks known as Employee Resource Groups 
(ERGs) and Corporate Communities. 
During the reporting year, we were a premium partner to the Spe-
cial Olympics, the world’s biggest sport event for athletes with 
intellectual and multiple disabilities. The World Games were held 
in Berlin in summer 2023 under the motto #UnbeatableTogether. 
Corporate Communities
To achieve shared goals and actively contribute to socially relevant 
issues, our employees can join Corporate Communities, or even 
set up one of their own. Numerous activities are being run by our 
employees under the focus topics of our CR strategy, including 
“digital society” (with the subtopics “digital participation” and 
“digital values”) and “low-carbon and circular society.”
Projects that promote media literacy are one focal point. With 
such projects, our employees help people better understand digi-
tal phenomena, thus laying the groundwork for participation in the 
digital world. One example is the Group-wide DIGITAL@School ini-
tiative. Using age-appropriate strategies and language, the com-
mitted employees in that initiative help children in schools and 
other educational institutions become acquainted with STEM (sci-
ence, technology, engineering, mathematics) subjects and help 
teachers and parents gain and expand their knowledge. In addi-
tion, they teach skills that children need in order to use digital 
media responsibly.
Our employees also work hard in Corporate Communities that aim 
to promote diversity and tackle prejudice. One example of these 
networks, which are known as Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), 
is MagentaPride. The LGBTQIA+ employee network at Deutsche 
Telekom looks out for the interests of staff who identify as queer. 
Similarly, BIPOC@Telekom is dedicated to supporting anyone who 
is affected by various discriminatory structures in society and aims 
to promote collective growth and create a safe space for black, 
indigenous, and other people of color. MerhabaMagenta, the net-
work for staff who share a connection through the Turkish lan-
guage, is actively involved in private fundraising campaigns for 
disasters such as the earthquake that hit Türkiye and Syria. Addi-
tional information on our approach to diversity, equity, and inclu-
sion is available here. 
The environment is also a critical issue. As part of our commitment 
in this area, employees active in our Green Pioneers movement in 
Germany have initiated efforts to help reduce our carbon footprint. 
These efforts contribute to our Group efforts in the area of sustain-
ability. 
There is also a steadily growing number of employees participat-
ing in the Human-centered Technology Community to help ensure 
the digital transformation is geared toward the values and needs 
of people. In the reporting year, this initiative won second place in 
the “CDR and Employees” category of the Corporate Digital 
Responsibility (CDR) Award.
In 2023, our employees contributed almost 180 000 volunteer 
hours. Further information on measuring the impact of our person-
nel commitment can be found here.
Emergency assistance in crisis situations
Our concept of responsibility also includes responding immedi-
ately in times of crisis, which is why we take action straight away 
when crises strike, particularly in regions where Deutsche Telekom 
has a presence. 
For maximum effect, we help on the ground, through our core 
business activities and strategic partnerships. Our employees also 
contribute their time and skills on a voluntary basis where they are 
needed – and are released to do so after consultation. This under-
scores our commitment to social responsibility and our willingness 
to actively help during difficult times.

Free phone calls and text messages in earthquake regions 
(Türkiye, Syria, Morocco)
It is especially important in disaster situations that people who are 
affected and their relatives can make contact with each other. 
After the devastating earthquake in the border region between 
Türkiye and Syria in February 2023, Telekom Deutschland made all 
phone calls and text messages from Germany to Türkiye and Syria 
free for Telekom and congstar customers when using Deutsche 
Telekom’s mobile and fixed networks. This took effect retroactively 
from February 6, 2023 through February 15, 2023. What’s more, 
the Deutsche Telekom Group enabled free roaming for data, text 
message, and voice services for Deutsche Telekom and congstar

customers in Türkiye and Syria up to February 15, 2023. Prepaid 
customers have already been recredited accordingly for the credit 
they had already used. This initiative was extended to February 24, 
2023. In total, this move enabled more than five million minutes of 
talktime in the disaster zone. Telekom Deutschland also supported 
the benefit concert Drei Akkorde für deine Spende (Three chords 
for your donation) in February 2023 in Düsseldorf, which saw 
numerous musicians take to the stage for free to raise money for 
the earthquake victims in Türkiye and Syria. All proceeds from the 
ticket sales went to the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, and 
Medico International. The Group also donated one million euros to 
Germany’s Relief Coalition for earthquake support.
After the devastating earthquake in Morocco, Telekom 
Deutschland once again made phone calls and text messages via 
the mobile and fixed networks of Deutsche Telekom free, to, from, 
and within the country. This applied to all consumers and business 
customers of Telekom and congstar from September 8 through 
September 30, 2023. What’s more, the Group enabled free roam-
ing for data, text message, and voice services for Telekom and 
congstar customers in Morocco up to September 30, 2023. 
Free phone calls and text messages to Israel
As a sign of solidarity with Israel, Telekom Deutschland made all 
phone calls and text messages to, from, and within the country via 
mobile and fixed networks free between October 12 and October 
31, 2023. This applied to all consumers and business customers of 
Telekom and congstar. Roaming was also free for Telekom and 
congstar customers in Israel for data, text messages, and voice 
services during this period.
Ukraine aid
After Russia’s attack on Ukraine in February 2022, Telekom 
Deutschland responded quickly and introduced extensive emer-
gency aid services for refugees from Ukraine. In Germany, free pre-
paid SIM cards were given to refugees in the spring of 2022 in 
coordination with the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees 
(BAMF). The SIM cards, which included free phone calls and data 
volume, were distributed through Telekom Shops and official aid 
organizations to those affected. Over the course of 2022, the free 
SIM cards were replaced with a new, low-cost rate plan, Magenta-
Mobil Prepaid Ukraine. This offer was extended in 2023. Since 
June 2022, Nummer gegen Kummer e. V. has been offering refu-
gees in Germany a free telephone counseling line through its Hel-
pline Ukraine. Telekom Deutschland is providing the technical 
infrastructure free of charge and is covering the connection fees.
United States segment
Hawaii wildfires
In August 2023, a series of wildfires broke out in the US state of 
Hawaii, predominantly on the island of Maui. Homes and busi-
nesses were destroyed and many people, including employees of 
T-Mobile US, were displaced. To support first responders, agen-
cies, officials, customers and communities, T-Mobile US rapidly 
worked to restore connectivity in areas where the fire damaged 
local fiber connections and where commercial power outages 
were impacting permanent cell sites. The company also provided 
concessions to all Maui customers who were not already on unlim-
ited plans. All T-Mobile US customers with Maui addresses 
received unlimited talk, text and data through September 7, 2023. 
In addition, evacuees and emergency personnel were provided 
with supplies like phones and charging cables.
Hurricane Idalia
Hurricane Idalia was a powerful hurricane that caused significant 
damage across parts of the southeastern United States in late 
August 2023. Over the last several years, Emergency Management 
teams have extensively hardened the T-Mobile US network. Ahead 
of every hurricane season, our teams work to ensure readiness and 
resiliency in areas projected to be impacted by hurricanes like Ida-
lia. When Hurricane Idalia intensified to Category 3 and continued 
its path toward landfall, the emergency plan was activated so 
teams could quickly begin recovery efforts to keep communities, 
first responders and customers along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic 
seaboard connected. Customer concessions for unlimited talk, text 
and data from 30 August through 5 September were positioned in 
impacted counties in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
Earthquake in Morocco
In response to the destructive earthquake in Morocco in Septem-
ber 2023, T-Mobile US offered assistance to affected customers to 
stay connected to friends and family during this critical time. 
T-Mobile US decided to waive international roaming and interna-
tional long-distance charges to and from Morocco and the US for 
its customers from 9 to 15 September 2023. This included calls 
made from within Morocco to local numbers.
Europe segment 
In 2023, Greece was hit by two severe wildfires. COSMOTE took 
emergency measures to help ensure citizens could stay in touch 
with each other. In particular, COSMOTE provided continuous 
assistance to its customers who were affected by the fires by cov-
ering their increased communications needs. For example, for a 
period of 15 days, 1 500 free minutes of call time in all national 
networks were offered, as well as 15 GB of free mobile internet 
access for all mobile network users. Furthermore, up until Septem-
ber 5, 2023, COSMOTE suspended all procedures for permanently 
or temporarily blocking all fixed and mobile network and pay-TV 
connections in the affected regions. In addition, COSMOTE organ-
ized a Call2Action initiative to collect essential supplies for the 
people on the island of Rhodes who had been affected by the 
wildfires.
In May 2023, the regions of Gračac, Čačinci, Obrovac, and Kosta-
jnica in Croatia suffered severe flooding. The national company 
there took action to help its customers. If their fixed-network ser-
vice was interrupted or adversely affected, customers were not 
billed for the services nor were they sent reminders. With regard to 
mobile-network services, Hrvatski Telekom activated seven days of 
unlimited internet use for contract customers in the flood-hit 
regions.

Our corporate culture 
A company’s culture is its DNA. As such, it influences not only its 
ways of working, but also its very success. Its culture is primarily 
shaped by the people who work for the company. Our goal is to 
promote a culture of belonging in which everyone gets what they 
need to capture their full potential. We are firmly convinced that 
this will contribute to our success as a global telecommunications 
provider and employer. That’s why we continually provide impetus 
for establishing and maintaining this kind of culture on our way to 
becoming the “leading digital telco”: for instance, by providing an 
environment where employees feel at ease and can perform their 
duties well in a working style that suits them. Our culture is char-
acterized by mutual trust and respect, entrepreneurial thinking, 
and collaborative working. We give our employees room to grow 
personally and professionally and to make a positive contribution 
to our company and society through their work.
Our corporate culture is based on our values, which we have for-
mulated in six Guiding Principles. The Guiding Principles are the 
basis for our cooperation with each other – and with our custom-
ers, shareholders, and the general public. Our Code of Conduct, 
which is founded on the Guiding Principles, makes our Guiding 
Principles come alive in tangible ways. It defines the rules for our 
daily work, including both internal and external work. As such, it 
acts as a bridge between the Guiding Principles and the many dif-
ferent policies and legal regulations within the Group. Another cor-
nerstone of our corporate culture is our Diversity, Equity and Inclu-
sion Group Policy, which is intended to help us consider and pro-
mote these factors at all levels of our company.
In September of each year, we celebrate our Living Culture Day, 
which provides an opportunity to reflect on our corporate culture 
and to make it perceptible for all of our employees around the 
world. In the reporting year, our celebration had the motto “The 
Power of We: Connections”. This year’s hybrid live stream event 
was held at Deutsche Telekom IT Solutions Slovakia in Košice and 
focused on the importance of social relationships for corporate 
culture and business success. This year’s Living Culture Day was 
held as a full Living Culture Week for the first time, making it possi-
ble for the various departments to present their culture-related 
topics to a larger audience. Our diversity networks, for example, 
had the opportunity to present the results of their work and pro-
jects – some of which have been underway for years – and 
increase the visibility of ERGs (employee resource groups) at the 
company. The event succeeded in recruiting new members for a 
variety of ERGs. Our corporate culture thrives on the commitment 
of our employees. This is particularly true of our ongoing culture 
dialog, which we invited our employees to participate in once 
again in 2023. The objective of this exchange is to integrate our 
Guiding Principles even more tightly in our everyday work. In the 
reporting year, it once again produced specific measures intended 
to make our culture tangible, such as the creation of several new 
ERGs. These new employee networks, together with the existing 
ones, serve employees as points of contact for all questions involv-
ing diversity in practice.
In addition, we once again recognized outstanding teams that 
exemplify our Guiding Principles through their actions and made 
an outsize contribution to our corporate culture in the reporting 
year with the Telekom Team Awards.
A new world of work
The workplace is changing rapidly, and the pace of the changes is 
constantly increasing. Chatbots support our customer service, vid-
eoconferences can take the place of business travel, and artificial 
intelligence helps out with data analysis. Not surprisingly, employ-
ees’ job profiles are changing as well. The half-life of knowledge 
keeps shortening, and core competencies for employees now 
include a readiness to change, and to learn.
At the same time, employees’ expectations with regard to their 
employers are also changing, in corresponding ways. Employees 
expect employers to offer them more personal freedom, greater 
flexibility, and less limitation to specific workplace locations. From 
such changes, a new balance between trust and responsibility is 
emerging. Strict controls and rigid office-time schedules will 
become things of the past. Today’s competent, committed, and 
entrepreneurially oriented employees are taking greater responsi-
bility for their work than past employees did. They are also assum-
ing greater responsibility for themselves overall.
As we become the Leading Digital Telco, the ways in which we col-
laborate are changing. We call it “New Work”. This is about more 
than simply whether employees work in the office or from their 
homes. It’s also about the essence of our work – about whether it 
is meaningful, and of use to society, and about how it helps take 
us, as a company, toward our common success.
Our journey toward a new, more flexible, more intelligent, more 
individual workplace began over a decade ago. Rather than focus-
ing on structures, this journey emphasizes attitudes and relation-
ships – including relationships among ourselves and with our cus-
tomers – and is directed at a changed understanding of what 
leadership should be. Such topics are also at the heart of our cor-
porate culture, which we are developing jointly, as a Living Culture. 
This culture supports a transformation process that calls on

employees to be willing to change and acquire new skills. This, in 
turn, presents challenges – challenges that we are addressing with 
comprehensive skills management and precisely tailored training 
options. Our Guiding Principle “Act with respect and integrity,” for 
example, entails that everyone should feel like they belong and be 
given the opportunity to capture their full potential. To achieve this 
goal, we support our managers and employees, for example, with 
training courses on all aspects of diversity.
We examine the transformation of the workplace in detail with our 
“NewWork@Telekom” magazine, which we publish several times 
per year. One subject we addressed in 2023 was how we can suc-
ceed in creating and maintaining trusted personal relationships 
despite distance in this age of virtual and hybrid collaboration. We 
also pursued the question of how our job and our work environ-
ment can contribute to our well-being.
Our New Work podcast “Frohes Schaffen. Neues Schaffen” (“Pleas-
ant work. New work.”) continued to examine changes in the world 
of work during the year under review. In it, we talked about what it 
means to work in a digital world, what new opportunities are aris-
ing in the labor market, and how competencies and job profiles are 
changing.
The virtual sessions of the talk series “Kopfsalat und Bauchgefühl” 
(“Brain turbulence and gut feeling”) give our employees in Ger-
many regular positive impulses and practical assistance for 
strengthening their own resilience in a constantly changing world 
of work. The one-hour sessions are hosted by a neuroscientist and 
also give our employees a space where they can interact and share 
with one another. More information about our activities for pro-
moting the mental health of our employees is available here.
Currently, the framework for our collaboration is defined by five 
pillars. We invite and expect our employees, in the context of their 
teams, to help flesh out the specific details of how this framework 
is applied. With this approach, we can combine the best of both 
worlds: the physical and the virtual worlds and the analog and dig-
ital worlds.
To this end, and working in cooperation with the Group Works 
Council, we have produced the New Work manifesto. It serves as 
the basis for interaction characterized by trust and respect.
Our “Digital@Work” program facilitates our employees’ collabora-
tion – with suitable tools and technologies. In addition, we are still 
working on making the new world of work visible by redesigning 
and optimizing our office spaces. We want our offices to invite and 
inspire employees to collaborate, interact, and carry out hybrid 
meetings and workshops. Throughout our locations in Germany 
and abroad, we are setting up spaces for digital collaboration and 
creativity in which employees can work together on projects and 
across units.
Digital collaboration
For effective collaboration in the new world of work, simple, fast 
and virtual communication is a fundamental requirement. Particu-
larly for collaboration between different locations and to support 
flexible working models, digital exchange plays a pivotal role.
In 2023, our employees spent around 1.7 billion minutes in virtual 
conferences. Compared to the previous year, conference minutes 
decreased by 8.7 percent. The return to the office after the COVID-
19 pandemic is probably one of the main factors behind this trend. 
As we resume normal interaction without social distancing, many 
employees can increasingly take the opportunity to attend meet-
ings in person and on-site. This has reduced the demand for virtual 
meetings.
For global exchange, we also use our YAM UNITED intranet portal. 
In the reporting year, 134 396 users were registered here.

Systems Solutions segment: corporate culture, collaboration, 
and leadership 
Cultural transformation and T-mindset
T-Systems launched its “#peoplemakeithappen” cultural initiative 
back in 2018. Since then, the segment has continued to evolve its 
corporate culture and formulate it as the “T-mindset” – the foun-
dation for the culture at T-Systems, which defines what it means to 
practice this culture. To achieve this, the segment identified five 
attitudes as the keys to growth at the company and the personal 
development of its employees: accountability, care, and a focus on 
the team, customers, and performance. In the year under review, 
this practical approach was communicated within T-Systems as a 
simplification of the T-mindset and the “I own it” campaign. The 
objective was to permanently embed the T-mindset cultural pro-
gram in the organization.
“I own it” is a campaign that enables employees to show how they 
take responsibility for their conduct at the company. To enshrine 
the T-mindset, management teams held 140 workshops in twelve 
countries and published 36 blog posts focused on internal com-
munication. In addition, managers reported on how they embody 
the T-mindset every day in 23 top leadership stories on “I own it”. 
Activities were derived globally and continued at the local level by 
multipliers. Overall, T-Systems counted some 26 000 personal 
interactions with employees globally – at workshops, events, and 
the campaigns centered on the themes of the cultural initiative. 
The segment has also taken the first steps in integrating the 
T-mindset in the entire employee life cycle. The cultural program 
has become a fixture at global onboarding events for new T-Sys-
tems employees, for example.

Corporate culture & the workplace

To give the individual business units even better support for their 
cultural and transformation work, T-Systems has appointed “dual 
citizens” to assist them: colleagues who can spend up to 50 per-
cent of their working time contributing to the cultural program on 
site, in close collaboration with the management teams.
To better balance the culture with the success of the company in 
the long term, the management team at T-Systems developed 
measures in 2022 that continued to be pursued in 2023. Accord-
ingly, managers are expected to:
	
Provide time to make the purpose of their individual tasks 
transparent to employees
	
Organize regular “Let’s talk” sessions within the teams, ensuring 
that there is enough room and time for an open exchange 
regarding employees’ concerns
	
Set priorities and thus gain time for effective, customer-centric 
work
Culture and leadership have also become fixtures of all top leader-
ship events. The culture team held four of these leadership events 
in 2023 to promote a management culture in line with the T-mind-
set.
According to the results of the most recent pulse survey, T-Sys-
tems continued to advance the cultural transformation in the year 
under review: Around 72 percent of those surveyed reported that 
the T-mindset is reflected in their daily conduct. This KPI was 
established in 2021 and has increased by 14 percentage points 
since its inception.
Agile collaboration
T-Systems continue to pursue its agile transformation in 2023, 
increasingly relying on agile structures for collaboration. This ena-
bled the segment to keep pace with rapid technological develop-
ments and growing customer demands. In the year under review, 
more than 300 agile coaches, or multipliers for the digital transfor-
mation, were active at T-Systems.
A cross-functional, 16-person team is responsible for scaling agil-
ity effectively – ensuring a transformation of the culture of collab-
oration in the organization as well. They focus on an extensive 
range of training: By the end of the year under review, T-Systems 
employees earned or renewed more than 5 000 certifications for 
agile work – for example, as scrum masters, product owners, safe 
experts, agile coaches, and coaches for the OKR (Objectives and 
Key Results) method. In addition, around 30 additional training for-
mats were offered in 2023 to embed agility in the organization, 
such as workshops on business agility and agile coaching and con-
sulting.
Flexible working models for a wide range of needs at 
Deutsche Telekom in Germany 
In order to help our employees achieve a good work-life balance, 
and avoid burn-out, we explicitly promote flexible work models. 
We have set out this orientation in our Diversity, Equity and Inclu-
sion Group Policy. The options we offer our employees in Germany 
range from flexitime and part-time to lifetime work accounts.
These work models are based on the laws and regulations applica-
ble in the individual countries. Working hours at Deutsche Telekom 
in Germany are governed by collective agreements and works 
agreements. We document the daily working hours of our employ-
ees covered by collective agreements by means of electronic time 
recording in MyPortal or via the EmployeeApp. This guarantees 
compliance with legal and company regulations; for example, it 
ensures that the weekly working hours for a specific flexitime bal-
ancing period are complied with. At a large corporation like 
Deutsche Telekom, regulations are diverse and cannot be fully 
specified for all the Group companies. The options we offer our 
employees in Germany range from flexitime and part-time to life-
time work accounts.
Promoting part-time work
We support the establishment of part-time jobs and guarantee 
employees in Germany the possibility to return to their original 
weekly working hours. Subject to operational requirements, 
employees are permitted to reduce their working hours as they 
wish. In addition, they may terminate their part-time work at any 
time, even earlier than originally planned. About 13.2 percent of 
employees covered by collective agreements, and 16.4 percent of 
civil servants, are making use of part-time arrangements (as of 
Dec. 31, 2023). In addition, a total of 44 executives are working 
part-time (as of Dec, 31, 2022).
Mobile working
Thanks to modern communications technology, in many different 
fields we can work when and where we wish. Mobile working has 
been firmly established at Deutsche Telekom. Our employees can 
organize their work locations flexibly, a right we enshrined in our 
collective agreement on mobile working concluded with the ver.di 
union back in 2016. Needless to say, they do not have to be availa-
ble to the company at all times, meaning they do not have to stay 
reachable after working hours, during vacation, or on weekends. In 
November 2023, we also began offering our employees in Ger-
many the option of working up to 20 days at a time from a differ-
ent EU country. 
Lifetime work accounts and leave of absence
The majority of employees in Germany can set up a lifetime work 
account in order to implement their personal life plan. Such 
accounts can be used to accumulate credit by means of gross 
deferred compensation or by conversion of up to 80 overtime 
hours per year. Around 16 400 employees currently take advan-
tage of this offering (as of December 31, 2023). The credit can be 
used for a sabbatical, earlier retirement, or a top-up for a part-time 
salary. Employees also have the option of taking unpaid leave – for 
example, in order to care for their children, or to accept paid work 
with a different employer.

Social
Corporate culture & the workplace

Leave of absence for personal reasons
Employees have the option of requesting leave of absence at short 
notice for special reasons, after consulting with, and obtaining the 
approval of, their manager. This option is available, for example, for 
employees who need to serve as caregivers for family members or 
to take care of sick children. During the individually agreed period, 
employees are exempted from the performance of their duties. 
Pay is suspended after five days at the latest. All other aspects of 
the employment relationship remain unaffected.
Time off for education
Time off for education is based on the current offer of unpaid leave 
and makes it possible for employees in Germany to take up to four 
years off for a degree course or a doctorate. The employment con-
tract is put on hold during this time and the employee does not 
receive any pay. Civil servants employed at the company can also 
take advantage of this offer in the form of a “leave of absence with-
out pay for reasons of private interest.” This time does not apply to 
their pension and no remuneration is paid.
The 80:20 model
Since 2017, we have been using the 80:20 model to give our 
employees the opportunity to spend part of their working time on 
projects outside of their usual remit. This allows them to work with 
teams from other departments. Use of the model is voluntary and 
is tied to a specific Group project.
Phased retirement
We offer a phased retirement model to our employees in Germany 
who are 55 or older. Separate regulations apply to employees and 
to civil servants. There are two options for phased retirement: the 
block model or the part-time model. During the reporting year, a 
total of 1 872 phased retirement contracts were concluded with 
employees both covered and not covered by collective agree-
ments. Among civil servants there were 431 such contracts (as of 
December 31, 2023).
Better quality of life through flexible working hours
Our The “FreiRaum” (leeway) working time model at T-Systems 
was continued to the end of 2023, but was not extended beyond 
that date. This model, offered since 2021, made it possible for all 
T-Systems employees who worked five-day weeks to take up to 
twelve additional days off per year. Employees who took advan-
tage of this option had their salaries reduced proportionately, 
while T-Systems provided partial compensation for the reduction. 
Some 540 employees made use of the model in the year under 
review. 
Starting in January 2024, all employees Group-wide have been 
offered a new, voluntary working time model: “Urlaub kaufen” (Buy 
vacation) is an employee-financed model that enables employees 
to take additional days off and that is characterized above all by its 
flexibility. There are no application deadlines or savings periods, for 
example, in contrast to the lifetime work account, which has both. 
In addition, the number of days off that can be purchased is not 
limited.

Achieving a good work-life balance at Deutsche Telekom
We offer our employees attractive solutions to help them achieve 
a better work-life balance. Our efforts in this area include providing 
flexible working time models, carrying out effective health promo-
tion, and establishing work-life balance as a permanent part of our 
corporate culture. To customize their work environments and work-
ing conditions, employees can take advantage of offers such as:
	
Childcare: Employees throughout Germany can use parent-
and-child offices at many Deutsche Telekom locations, for 
example, if their regular childcare is unavailable. We also sup-
port employees all year long in their search for childcare 
options, so they can rest assured that their children will be well 
cared for even during school holidays. In this context, Deutsche 
Telekom also offers activity days and a holiday camp during 
summer vacation.
	
Part-time training: Under certain circumstances, apprentices at 
Deutsche Telekom can take their training on a part-time basis. 
Dual students, including students who are single parents, have 
the option of completing their degree programs on a part-time 
basis.
	
Employee networks: Our employees in Germany can join and 
participate in a variety of networks. Expectant parents, for 
instance, can join the “Stay in contacT” network, enabling them 
to keep in contact with the company during their parental 
leave. This network also offers support for re-entering working 
life after parental leave. Our “fathers network” encourages the 
discussion and open exchange of experiences between fathers 
and provides information and tips for becoming more family-
friendly. We also offer our Parental Leave App to employees, an 
innovative solution that gives digital support to expectant 
mothers and fathers on their journey to parenthood. This app 
also enables interaction with other employees through the 
“Stay in contacT” network.
	
Learning and networking opportunities: We want to support 
the cultural transformation with regard to work-life balance 
through training and workshops, to improve chances for equal 
participation of women in the labor market. Examples include 
the “Working Dad” keynote and the mentoring program “Child 
and Career,” for managers, junior managers, and expert staff at 
Deutsche Telekom. You can find out more about our commit-
ment to employing a higher proportion of women here.
	
Free advisory and referral services: To support our employees 
in dealing with personal changes, we offer free, anonymous 
advisory services in some countries. Through our cooperating 
partner “awo lifebalance GmbH” and an online service, we also 
support our employees in Germany in the areas of childcare 
(including emergency care), caregiving for family members, 
and household services.

	
Family Fund: In Germany, we fund employee projects aimed at 
improving their work-life balance.
	
Social fund: We provide fast financial aid to employees in Ger-
many who find themselves in financial difficulties through no 
fault of their own. We also offer subsidies for recreational activ-
ities for children with disabilities.
	
Welfare service: Through this foundation, we support employ-
ees in Germany in emergency situations, such as deaths in the 
family, serious illness, social crises, and natural disasters. We 
offer courses for women with cancer, for instance. We also pro-
vide assistance for employees’ children who are studying at a 
university.
	
Recreation Service: Working through this service, we offer our 
employees access to reasonably priced vacations at attractive 
destinations in Germany and Europe – for example, at one of 
18 company-owned resorts.

Our approach to shaping employee relations
We pursue dialog-oriented employee relations throughout the 
Group and engage in trust-based, constructive collaboration with 
employee representatives and unions. Our works councils, central 
works councils, and Group Works Council represent the interests 
of our employees at our Group in Germany.
Our partner representing the employees’ interests on a European 
level is the European Works Council (EWC). We also have execu-
tive staff representation committees and representatives for 
employees with disabilities at the unit, company, and Group levels. 
Even in non-European nations like the United States, all of our 
employees enjoy the right to form and join labor unions. As the 
underlying laws and contracts vary from country to country, co-
determination matters are managed locally, and always together 
with trade unions and employees’ representatives. Group manage-
ment is generally involved in all major issues.
We have set Group-wide uniform standards for managing 
employee relations, as defined in our Guiding Principles, in our 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Group Policy, and in our Code of 
Human Rights. Our previous policy statement “Code of Human 
Rights & Social Principles” was revised extensively in the year 
under review. This Code includes our global voluntary commit-
ment to safeguarding the freedom of association and the right to 
collective bargaining (in compliance with national law in each 
case). The new structure of the Code of Human Rights is based on 
the requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Liefer-
kettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG). The Employee Relations 
Policy was also discontinued as an independent document and 
integrated in the policy statement. Comprehensive information 
about compliance with human rights at our Group is provided in 
the chapter on “Human rights”.
Not all employees in our upstream value chain have the option of 
collective bargaining. This is also the case in our downstream value 
chain, for example, at recycling companies for electronic scrap. 
The impact assessment of our materiality analysis showed that in 
the upstream value chain stages of the global electronics industry, 
there are only limited opportunities for union representation. We 
have implemented a comprehensive supplier management system 
to address risks to human rights in our upstream value chain.

Dialog and cooperation with employee representatives
During the reporting year, the company concluded 45 collective 
agreements with the ver.di union in Germany. As part of harmoniz-
ing the remuneration systems within the Group, we also concluded 
collective agreements on a global, uniform job architecture.
Responsible collective bargaining plays an important role and has 
a long tradition at our company. The percentage of employees 
covered by collective agreements is published in the non-financial 
statement in our Annual Report.
Constructive dialog
In 2023, we continued the constructive dialog with our works 
councils. As the underlying laws and contracts vary from country 
to country, co-determination matters are managed locally with 
trade unions and employees’ representatives. Group management 
is generally involved in all major issues. Further information can be 
found in our Annual Report.
Fair pay and benefits 
We offer our employees competitive, performance-based remu-
neration oriented to the relevant national labor market. Our remu-
neration policies are structured to guarantee equal pay for all 
employees; they do not discriminate.
With our Global Compensation Guideline for executives, collective 
agreements and works agreements, we ensure a transparent and 
gender-neutral payment structure and remuneration for our 
employees at the Group. Under this guideline, pay is based on the 
degree of difficulty and complexity of the specific task, and not on 
the individual person. We thereby ensure that remuneration at the 
Deutsche Telekom Group is based on the type and scope of the 
work performed and the requirements of the relevant position, 
irrespective of diversity aspects such as gender, age, nationality, 
sexual orientation, or ethnicity. In addition, we offer our employees 
additional benefits, such as contributions to the company pension 
scheme, and subsidized share purchasing in the framework of our 
Shares2you program.
As part of our Group-wide employee survey, we regularly ascertain 
how satisfied our employees are with their pay. We also conduct 
other surveys on specific topics and in specific units.
In 2018, we compiled a report on equal pay and equality for the 
first time in order to comply with the new legal requirements of 
the Transparency in Wage Structures Act. It is published every five 
years. The current report for the year 2021 is available here.

In addition, in 2021 – after our first participation in 2013 – we 
once again took part in the equal pay check of the Federal Anti-
Discrimination Agency and were awarded the “eg-check” certifi-
cate. This certificate documents that the same or equivalent work 
by men and women is paid in the same amount: salaries at the 
company are based solely on the type of work being performed.

Salary development at Deutsche Telekom in Germany 
In the collective bargaining round in May 2022, a salary increase in 
two steps for around 55 000 Telekom employees, apprentices, and 
dual students in Germany was agreed. The first step was imple-
mented on August 1, 2022. The second followed on June 1, 2023. 
Salaries increased by 5.2 percent in pay groups one to five, by 5 
percent in pay group six, and by 4.8 percent in pay groups seven 
to ten. The collective wage agreements have a term of 24 months. 
They may be terminated for the first time as of March 31, 2024.
For apprentices and dual students, the negotiating parties agreed 
on a salary increase in two steps: by 3.1 percent as of August 1, 
2022 and by 35 euros as of June 1, 2023. Subsistence allowance 
for apprentices not living with their parents increased by 30 euros 
to 300 euros as of August 1, 2022.
To soften the impacts of inflation, additional one-time payments of 
1 000 euros were granted to employees in the lower and middle 
pay groups. Additional one-time payments totaling 200 euros 
were agreed for apprentices and dual students. The first install-
ment of these payments was paid out in July 2022, with the sec-
ond following in February 2023.
Salary development and remuneration systems at the Sys-
tems Solutions segment in Germany 
In late 2022, the ver.di union and T-Systems held talks on a collec-
tive agreement in Germany. In December 2022, before the expira-
tion of the collective agreements that were in force at the time, 
T-Systems presented a contract that the union accepted in early 
2023. In this collective agreement, the parties agreed on salary 
increases in two steps: up to 3.1 percent, depending on the salary 
group, as of January 1, 2023, and a further 2.1 percent for all sal-
ary groups effective March 2024. This is supplemented by two 
one-time payments totaling 1 000 euros for lower salary groups. 
The collective agreement applies directly to the relevant employ-
ees at T-Systems International GmbH and T-Systems Road User 
Services GmbH. In addition to the salary adjustments and tax-free 
one-time payments contained in the collective agreement, 
employees in Germany whose full-time annual salaries do not 
exceed 75 000 euros received an energy bonus of 1 000 euros, 
exempt from taxes and social insurance contributions, in March 
2023. The qualifying T-Systems employees in Germany also bene-
fited from this payment.

Our employee survey 
Our employee survey, which of late has been carried out every two 
years, is a key indicator of the relationship between our Company 
and its workforce. The results of the employee survey help us to 
identify weaknesses and eliminate them. We use the responses to 
calculate the engagement score, a gauge for employee satisfac-
tion. On top of this, we conduct pulse surveys (carried out twice a 
year, or once a year in years when the employee survey is carried 
out), which give us a sentiment snapshot across the Group.
During the 2021 employee survey, the questionnaire and the 
measurement model were revised and updated based on feed-
back and the latest scientific findings: New questions were added 
and some of the existing questions were adapted. In addition, the 
scale used for the engagement score (formerly, the “commitment 
index”) was changed from “1 to 5” to “1 to 100.” The engagement 
score is calculated based on questions on the following aspects: 
mood, employer attractiveness, brand identity, and inspiration.
A total of 80 percent of all employees throughout the Group took 
part in the most recent employee survey in 2021. The engage-
ment score amounted to 77 points.
The employee survey was not carried out in the reporting year on 
account of a change in service provider, and has instead been 
rescheduled for 2024.
Regular pulse survey
In addition to the employee survey, which of late has been carried 
out every two years, we also conduct regular pulse surveys to 
measure employee satisfaction – usually twice a year. If the 
employee survey and pulse survey both occur in the same year, 
the pulse survey is only carried out once. The most recent pulse 
survey in November 2023 saw a 77 percent response rate among 
employees. The engagement score reached a high value of 76 
points. The values reflect the survey findings excluding the USA 
segment, since T-Mobile US conducts its own employee survey.

Employee identification with CR commitment ESG KPI
We use the “Employee identification with CR commitment” ESG 
KPI to determine the degree to which our staff identify with, or 
how satisfied they are, with our CR commitment. This is based on 
the Group employee survey (excluding T-Mobile US), which of late 
has been carried out every two years. The last survey was carried 
out in 2021: The vast majority of our employees agreed that 
Deutsche Telekom lives up to its responsibility for society and the 
environment. And a full 84 percent identified with our commit-
ment. The next Group-wide employee survey will take place in the 
second quarter of 2024.
Our ambition in this context: Increase the KPI

Satisfaction and commitment score
We calculate the satisfaction rate and the commitment score as 
gauges for employee satisfaction. The displayed values are taken 
from the last pulse and employee surveys. The last pulse survey 
was conducted in November 2023, the last employee survey in 
November 2021.
The Group-wide satisfaction among our employees dropped to 78 
percent in the reporting year. The commitment score from 2023 
was 76 at the Group level, on a scale from 0 to 100. Compared to 
the previous year, the commitment score decreased by two points, 
marking a halt in the upward trend of the preceding two years. This 
was true at all levels.

Our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion
More than 200 000 people work at Deutsche Telekom – and every 
one of them is unique. This diversity is our strength. For us, diver-
sity means offering our employees numerous opportunities to 
grow professionally and to develop personally – regardless of their 
age, gender identity and gender features, physical and mental 
abilities, nationality, social and ethnic background, religion and 
beliefs, and sexual orientation. We promote equal opportunities for 
everyone and are clearly committed to the different dimensions of 
diversity. We have a Group-wide approach for upholding this com-
mitment: It is based on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Group 
Policy (formerly “Diversity Policy”), our six Guiding Principles, and 
our Code of Human Rights. 
Living diversity, equity, and inclusion 
We are proud to employ people who are committed to the differ-
ent aspects of diversity and actively help us shape our corporate 
culture. Our employees have joined together in numerous global 
and local networks, which we call employee resource groups 
(ERGs) and corporate communities. In these employee initiatives, 
they devise a variety of measures and implement them together, 
actively helping to strengthen awareness for diversity and equity 
among the workforce. The ERGs meet once a month in Group-
wide community calls, in which they receive relevant updates for 
their groups from Group Headquarters and have the opportunity 
to share best practices and current challenges with one another. In 
Germany, for example, our employees in the “BIPoC@DT” ERG 
support the Black, Indigenous and People of Color community. 
New groups founded in the reporting year include the “Social Mov-
ers”, an ERG that focuses on social background, the “Better-
Together” community for intergenerational collaboration, and a 
network for neurodiversity. T‑Mobile US has six internal ERGs for 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). 
Our diversity strategy is aligned with efforts such as those 
described above and pursues initiatives aimed at promoting par-
ticipation among all these dimensions. We signed the UN Stand-
ards of Conduct for Business Tackling Discrimination against 
LGBTQIA+ people in 2017. This abbreviation refers to people who 
identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, or 
asexual. In addition, the MagentaPride ERG was founded back in 
2002. Since then, it has worked unceasingly to support our LGBT-
QIA+ employees and help them through difficult life situations. To 
draw attention to discrimination of queer people and support 
them in their fight for more rights and greater visibility, we cele-
brated with them once again in 2023 at pride marches and Chris-
topher Street parades in a variety of countries.
As another important step toward creating an inclusive corporate 
culture, we published the first version of our Transgender Guide in 
2022, to support a trans-inclusive workplace and show how to cre-
ate a trans-inclusive work environment. The Guide is intended for 
all employees and provides assistance with questions like “What 
support is available for transition, outing, and fundamental 
changes at work?” and “What can I do when I experience or wit-
ness discrimination?” At the same time, the Guide also serves as a 
source of information for all employees who want to learn more 
about this topic and lend their support. Further steps toward 
becoming inclusive for employees who identify as trans or non-
binary include ongoing updates to our IT systems with regard to 
gender-sensitive forms of address and the possibility to self-iden-
tify, as well as the creation of all-gender restrooms at several sites 
in Germany.
The establishment of multifaith prayer and meditation rooms at 
selected sites in Germany, a project initiated in late 2022, is 
another step intended to reflect the real lives of our employees in 
the designs of our buildings.
To express our appreciation and respect of all people, we generally 
use a neutral, inclusive form of address and are committed to gen-
der-sensitive communication. As such, gender-neutral language is 
an integral part of our editorial guide for corporate communica-
tions.
To ensure that our employees can contribute their abilities as best 
as possible in all walks of life, we also support the work-life bal-
ance in the context of equal opportunity – for example, through 
flexible working hours, hybrid working models, and part-time work.
Our commitment to diversity also includes our efforts to promote 
digital participation. We take a number of approaches to make our 
networks, products, and services as accessible and non-discrimi-
natory as possible. 
We are a founding member of the “Diversity Charter” business ini-
tiative as well as a cooperation partner in a number of other 
national and international initiatives for diversity, equity, and par-
ticipation – because we want to promote these topics both within 
and outside the company. Unfortunately, diversity efforts are une-
venly distributed. The impact assessment of our materiality analy-
sis identified a significant risk of discrimination incidents due to 
origin, sexual orientation, and gender identity in countries in our 
upstream and downstream value chains. Violations of our Guiding 
Principles and corporate values can be reported at any time 
through our anonymous whistleblower portal Tell me! and to our

Threat Management unit. We follow up on every tip-off on viola-
tions. We have also implemented a comprehensive supplier man-
agement system to address these and other risks in our upstream 
value chain.
Diversity in figures
People from more than 120 countries work successfully together 
at Deutsche Telekom. The average age of our employees was 41.4 
years in the reporting year. 
All in all in the reporting year, 35.7 percent of our total workforce 
were women. We have a particularly strong commitment to gen-
der equality, and we have made it a priority for more than two dec-
ades. One of our central goals is to increase the share of women in 
expert and managerial positions; by 2025, we want to have 
women in at least 30 percent of our leadership positions (exclud-
ing T-Mobile US). We have enacted various measures in order to 
achieve our goal of 30 percent. 
7.6 percent (as of Dec. 31, 2023) of our employees in Germany 
have disabilities, putting us well over the statutory quota of five 
percent. Nearly 2 percent of our apprentices and dual students in 
Germany are young people with disabilities – that figure, in com-
parison to the total share of young people with disabilities in our 
society, shows that we train above-average numbers of young 
people in this segment as well. The Group Representatives for 
Employees with Disabilities present annual Inclusion Awards to 
recognize projects that advocate for the support and retention of 
employees with disabilities at the company.
We received multiple awards in the reporting year for our commit-
ment to diversity.

Diversity Charter 
The Diversity Charter is an independent economic initiative that is 
supported by around 4 500 companies and institutions in Ger-
many. Its aim is to create a work environment in which diversity 
among employees, and their many different abilities and talents, is 
valued. Such an environment opens up opportunities for innova-
tive and creative solutions. Deutsche Telekom is a founding mem-
ber of the Diversity Charter association. In addition, a number of 
our national companies are also members of this initiative – 
including T-Systems ITC Iberia and Magyar Telekom in Hungary.
The initiative declared the eleventh German Diversity Day in May 
2023 under the motto #FlaggeFürVielfalt (#FlagForDiversity). As 
part of the Rhine-Ruhr Diversity Network, we participated with an 
online event on the topic of “Psychological security and belong-
ing”. The Network is a union of global companies and advocates for 
a corporate culture that promotes diversity in the region. Collabo-
ration and the exchange of ideas in the Network are intended to 
inspire new ideas and action areas as impetus for companies’ own 
diversity strategies. The Rhine-Ruhr Diversity Network also cele-
brated the 10th anniversary of its founding in 2023. 
The diversity audit, established in the higher education sector in 
2013 under the name “Create Diversity”, evolved into the “Diver-
sity Compass” (only available in German) in 2022 through our 
efforts and those of the Diversity Charter, the Donors’ Association 
for the Promotion of Humanities and Sciences in Germany (Stif-
terverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft), and representatives of 
other companies. The aim of this effort was to adapt the audit to 
the specific requirements and interests of companies. This will 
enable companies – including Deutsche Telekom – to use the 
audit in future to review and refine their own measures in the area 
of diversity. The “Diversity Compass” was launched as a pilot pro-
ject with a variety of companies in January 2023. The field service 
department of the Germany segment took part in the pilot phase 
for Deutsche Telekom and developed custom-tailored targets for 
its workforce. In the long term, we hope the Compass will help to 
audit and continue develop measures aimed at promoting diver-
sity. 
Together with coaches experienced in anti-racism work, the Diver-
sity Charter developed an online toolbox in recent years on the 
topic of “Anti-racist awareness-raising – building expertise for 
diversity at the workplace.” In 2022, Deutsche Telekom tested this 
toolbox in a pilot phase in a number of workshops with members 
from the ERGs in Germany. The toolbox was published externally in 
March 2023 and can now be used by anyone who wants to serve 
as a multiplier for anti-racism topics in their own organization.
United States segment: diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I)
DE&I has always been a part of the Un-carrier culture, and the seg-
ment is committed to having DE&I touch every aspect of its future. 
Providing equitable opportunities for all is also a key focus of the 
ESG framework at T-Mobile US.
Equity In Action (EIA) plan
In 2020, T-Mobile US launched its five-year EIA plan spanning the 
values the segment lives by including how investments are made, 
how opportunities are provided to employees, how suppliers are 
selected, and how the company advocates for communities. 
T-Mobile US made 54 DE&I Promises as part of its EIA plan. 
EIA was built by listening to employees at T-Mobile US. Their feed-
back identified areas where the segment could further evolve, 
shift, and align as an organization. This plan is anchored to what 
matters most: 
	
TALENT – T-Mobile US recognizes that the company is stronger 
and more innovative as a result of diversity. That’s why the seg-
ment’s hiring and development programs are enhanced by 
equitably expanding opportunities for talent.
	
CULTURE – T-Mobile US lives its value One Team Together by 
creating a culture of respect and belonging. That’s why the 
segment engages employees, listens, solves pain points, edu-
cates, and takes action.

	
BRAND – We all win when our communities thrive. That’s why 
T-Mobile US drives equity by investing in communities through 
its Foundation, partners, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), 
and DE&I Chapters.
	
DIGITAL EQUITY – T-Mobile US increases digital equity by 
expanding access to connectivity, skills development, and 
internships.
As a part of the Equity In Action plan, T‑Mobile US established an 
External Diversity and Inclusion Council, which includes members 
from civil rights and social justice organizations. The External 
Council helps guide and support the EIA plan and delivery of the 
54 DE&I promises. We have achieved the majority of our EIA Prom-
ises.
Employee-led diversity
Beginning as an employee-led grassroots movement, employee 
resource groups (ERGs) at T-Mobile US are an important part of 
the company culture. The six ERGs and four sub-affinity groups of 
T-Mobile drive actions to solve business and employee pain points 
while celebrating the rich diversity of employees’ culture, heritage, 
and experience. The DE&I network includes a group for people 
with disabilities (Accessibility Community), a multicultural group 
(Multicultural Alliance), an intergenerational network (Multigenera-
tional Network), an LGBTQI+ community (Pride), a network for vet-
erans and active military personnel (Veterans & Allies Network), 
and a women’s network (Women & Allies Network). They foster a 
sense of belonging by sparking conversations and providing 
opportunities to develop leadership skills. 
Joining forces on a military hiring mission
T-Mobile US is dedicated to building lasting careers for veterans 
and military spouses and the company is proud to have met its 
goal of hiring 10 000 military veterans and their spouses at the 
end of 2023. Military families are reached through job fairs and 
Veterans Affairs offices and through partnerships with groups like 
FourBlock, Hiring our Heroes, and Warriors4Wireless. T-Mobile US 
also expanded recruiting efforts with American Vets Group, Blue-
Star Families, Tech for Troops, Warriors & Quiet Waters, in addition 
to others. 
T-Mobile US continued to support its Military Fellowship Program, 
a 12-week internship program with T-Mobile US, and the Military 
Spouse Fellowship Program to provide enhanced opportunities to 
transitioning service members. In that same spirit, the company is 
evaluating how the existing benefits support military families to 
make employment with T-Mobile US more feasible.
Europe segment: diversity
Deutsche Telekom’s corporate culture forms the foundation for our 
everyday work. “Act with respect and integrity” is one of our Guid-
ing Principles, which we always follow – even under extremely het-
erogeneous societal and political frameworks like those in the 
Europe segment. Accordingly, diversity is an important topic for 
the segment and is actively practiced at our national companies. 
Our national company in Croatia stands for a “world of equal 
opportunity”. We consider individuality and diversity in our teams 
to be strengths, and advocate for equal opportunity for promotion 
and growth for everyone. 
The efforts of our Polish national company are being noticed and 
are reflected, for example, in acknowledgment received in the 
framework of the annual Diversity IN Check survey, which is organ-
ized by the Polish NGO Responsible Business Forum. This distinc-
tion was awarded once again in the reporting year. Based on a sur-
vey, companies are rated on their ability to manage diversity and 
build integrative organizations.
Commitment to a larger share of women 
As a signatory to the “Women Empowerment Principles” of the 
United Nations, we have made it our goal to increase the propor-
tion of women on the Supervisory Board, the Board of Manage-
ment, and upper and upper management: we want to achieve a 
30-percent share of women worldwide by 2025. We are imple-
menting numerous measures to this end:
	
Our opportunities to achieve a good work-life balance through 
parental leave arrangements, flexible working hours, and child-
care services
	
Specifically addressing female talent through cooperative 
activities and at events
	
Promoting the generation shift between male executives due 
to leave the company in the near future and female junior staff 
(mentoring)
	
Increasingly filling management positions with female talent, 
including a target quota of 40 percent in the Global Talent Hub
	
Access to external programs such as the IWIL (International 
Women in Leadership) community through our Global Talent 
Hub, where we enable participation in the “Leadership Next 
Academy” and a program for female mentors
	
Maintaining or increasing the diversity targets, including in 
transformation processes, especially when filling management 
positions
	
Intersectional offerings to improve the visibility of BIPoC 
women at Deutsche Telekom (in cooperation with the publish-
ers of the book “People of Deutschland”, with whom we devel-
oped a special Deutsche Telekom issue in the reporting year 
that profiled Deutsche Telekom employees with a migration 
background)

eliminate systematic obstacles – for example, by asking ques-
tions about participation in exit interviews

Signing the “Joint declaration against sexism and sexual har-

is sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, 
Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) and pursued 
together with EAF Berlin. It aims to recognize sexism and sex-
ual harassment, name it as such, and establish effective coun-
termeasures 
Together with the heads of our segments, we reached agreement 
on implementation plans for increasing our women’s quota. Our 
diverse range of measures has allowed us to continuously increase 
the share of women in management positions in recent years. The 
proportion of women in middle and upper management was 27.9 
percent in the reporting year. At 45 percent, we have already 
exceeded our 30 percent target for the Group Supervisory Board 
(2022: 50 percent). We have also been successful with regard to 
the statutory gender quota for supervisory boards in Germany 
since January 1, 2016; in this area, at 47.3 percent, we are within 
the overall average for all legal entities in Germany. With a share of 
women of 37.5 percent (as of December 31, 2023), the Deutsche 
Telekom Board of Management also exceeds our own and the 
legally mandated requirements. However, further efforts are 
needed to meet the target mentioned above for the remaining 
management positions on the two levels beneath the Board of 
Management, in the management of the national companies, and 
the internal supervisory boards in Germany. 
We are also working to increase the number of women participat-
ing in dual study programs in technical fields in Germany. By the 
end of the reporting year, the proportion of women studying tech-
nical subjects stood at 14 percent.
Our commitment to gender equality was recognized for the sixth 
year in a row in 2023 with our inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender-
Equality Index (GEI). Further information can be found here.
Networking for success
Our locally organized women’s networks help women reach man-
agement positions by providing support, advice, and exchange 
with other women. All of Deutsche Telekom’s women’s networks 
met for the first time at an international event in the summer of 
2023, with a total of 220 women participating on site or in the pro-
vided live stream.
Promoting female STEM specialists
With carefully targeted messaging, we are seeking to attract tal-
ented women to our company. In particular, we support women in 
STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) subjects 
and careers:  As part of our partnership with Femtec, we once 
again organized an innovation workshop in 2022/2023. Femtec, a 
cooperative effort being undertaken by major companies, the 
Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, leading German technical universities, 
and ETH Zürich, is aimed at finding young female talent for STEM 
professions and developing it. During the five-month innovation 
workshop, 20 international women fellows developed technically 
innovative and green solutions for intelligent, energy-independent 
cell sites in Germany and the EU. We also invited current and for-
mer Femtec women fellows to a variety of events, including Digital 
X and our Magenta Campus Tour, to help them stay in contact and 
advise them on hiring and career opportunities. Through our coop-
eration with “ITgirls”, we want to reach out to female school and 
university students and encourage them to pursue a promising 
career in the IT sector.

women in management positions in 2020. A third woman was 
appointed to the Board of Management in November 2020. With a 
share of women of 37.5 percent, we were among the top five DAX

handful of DAX corporations with an established track record of 
women on its Board of Management. The number of women work-
ing in the international management team reporting to the Group 
Board of Management has also risen. 
In addition, we aim to make the membership of the Board of Man-
agement more diverse with regard to other dimensions, such as 
nationality and age, to bring different experiences and background 
together and increase the range of opinions and skills for good 
company management.

Promoting the diversity of our young talent in Germany 
Right during the process for hiring new colleagues, we emphasize 
diversity and consider options other than just traditional educa-
tional and life paths. We make targeted efforts to promote diver-
sity among our junior staff. To this end, we analyze and promote 
the diverse potential of young people. Under certain circum-
stances, apprentices at Deutsche Telekom can take their training 
on a part-time basis. Dual students also have the option of com-
pleting their cooperative study program on a part-time basis under 
certain circumstances – if they are single parents, for example. In 
addition, we offered DiscoverMINT@telekom, a one-year orienta-
tion program, for the second year running in 2023. This program 
targets young people with university entrance qualifications who 
are still unsure what to do with respect to their further training. In 
close cooperation with their instructors, participants are sup-
ported and coached for twelve months during the program at 
Deutsche Telekom, experience professional practice, and attend 
courses and events at the university. The program is intended to 
help participants to get acquainted with the dual-study STEM 
environment and make a sound decision for the next step in their 
development. We also continue to offer young refugees opportuni-
ties to start their careers through the DiscoverMINT program – an 
apprenticeship, or a dual study program. We generally ensure that 
all applicants who wish to start a career at Deutsche Telekom can 
enjoy a non-discriminatory application process. As of December 
31, 2023, around 6 percent of the apprentices and dual students 
we employed were of non-German nationality; in total, 63 nations 
were represented.

Age structure in the DT Group
The average age within the Group decreased by 0.3, to 41.4 years 
within the reporting period. The reported figures substantiate this 
trend. The applicable percentage shares for the various age groups 
have shifted slightly.
About one half of the company’s workforce falls into the age 
groups 36–45 and 46–55. In a trend apparent since 2018, the per-
centage of persons in the age group 46–55 has been decreasing 
continuously, from 29.0 percent to 23.6 percent in the reporting 
year. At the same time, the percentage of persons in the age group 
36–45 has grown continuously throughout the same period, 
except in 2021. Overall, this percentage has increased from 23.5 
percent to 25.5 percent.
Although the age group 56–65 grew by 0.2 percentage points, the 
overall number of persons in the age group 46–65 has decreased. 
In 2023, the two oldest age groups accounted for a share of 38.5 
percent. This figure was down from 39.8 percent in 2022. We are 
making good progress in our efforts to make our workforce 
younger – and thereby to counter the demographic changes in 
society as a whole.

Company pension scheme at Deutsche Telekom in Germany
Deutsche Telekom offers its employees in Germany a company 
pension scheme based on voluntary commitments. It comprises 
two main components: a capital accounts plan and the Deutsche 
Telekom Pension Fund.
The capital accounts plan is a system for provision of employer-
financed pension entitlements. In addition, and as provided for by 
law, eligible Deutsche Telekom employees can arrange to have 
part of their salary converted into pension benefits – in this case, 
via the Deutsche Telekom Pension Fund. This system amounts to a 
state-subsidized option for an employee-financed pension 
scheme.

Our approach to training and development 
We offer our employees a wide range of specific training and 
development programs. Important principles for this are defined in 
our Code of Human Rights and in our Guiding Principles. For many 
units at Deutsche Telekom, specific agreements were also reached 
with the employees’ representatives on the subject of training. The 
training we offer our employees pays off. In 2023, for example, we 
were able to fill 51 percent of our open positions with internal can-
didates (2022: 33 percent; 2021: 51 percent; 2020: 66 percent).1
Training the experts of tomorrow
We offer many young people the opportunity to enter the work-
place. For example, we have a comprehensive range of technical 
and commercial apprenticeship programs that train our skilled 
workers of tomorrow. In 2023, the Group offered around 2 000 
training positions, including more than 1 220 positions for appren-
ticeships and about 750 positions for persons in dual study bache-
lor’s degree programs. In addition, up to 25 young people took 
part in our 12-month DiscoverMINT program, which offers career 
orientation and a chance to explore opportunities in the digital 
workplace. The programs we offer make us one of the largest train-
ing providers in Germany. Our training programs provide a founda-
tion for digital competence – and thereby enable our apprentices 
to make a seamless transition into the digital workplace.
Promoting lifelong learning
We promote lifelong learning and support our employees on their 
individual learning paths. We start by reviewing the skills our 
employees have now and those they will need in the future. On this 
basis, we offer our employees tailored training and development 
programs. These can also include stays abroad or studies parallel 
to their jobs. For example, Bologna@Telekom gives employees 
access to part-time bachelor’s and master’s degree programs. 
Since its introduction more than ten years ago, a total of 2 310 
employees in Germany have taken advantage of this opportunity.

WeLearn
In order to prepare our employees for the future requirements of 
the job market and ensure that they can participate successfully in 
the workplace, we offer them various development programs to 
expand their digital capabilities. With the “Explorer Journeys,” our 
employees can acquire basic skills in the areas of data analytics, 
software development, digital marketing, user experience design 
(UX design), artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud and DevOps tech-
nologies. These learning journeys are open to both beginners and 
experts. For example, our global upskilling programs in the areas of

data science, data engineering, and data visualization help experts 
deepen their specialist knowledge. In 2023, a total of 8 200 
employees took part in our Explorer Journeys. Our multi-week pro-
grams on “Generative AI” registered a total of 2 468 participants. 
Thanks to retraining programs such as the Junior Software Devel-
opment Academy, our employees also have the opportunity to 
develop themselves in an entirely new area – customer advisors 
can retrain as software developers, for example. As a result, the 
programs also help us expand our own pool of candidates. 
Learning independently, and digitally
From 2019 to 2022, our “youlearn” initiative supported our overall 
aim of developing Deutsche Telekom as a learning organization. 
In the process, we offered our employees worldwide (excluding 
those of T-Mobile US) the opportunity to manage much of their 
own training, with online courses, and to make learning an integral 
part of their everyday working life. In the reporting year, we have 
continued these efforts, while also highlighting the sense of com-
munity fostered by the initiative: Since the summer of 2023, 
“WeLearn” has been the motto for all of our learning programs. 
Over the past few years, and via the Percipio learning platform, 
which we introduced in 2019, we have continued to expand our 
online education and training programs at the global level (exclud-
ing T-Mobile US). In addition to a desktop solution, the Percipio 
app lets users access content anytime and anywhere. It offers a 
wide range of courses, videos, books, and audio books on topics 
such as leadership, technology and development, and digital 
transformation, and it conveys the learning content in an enter-
taining way. Content is offered in 18 languages – with the help of 
dubbing and subtitling. In 2023, some 164 000 Deutsche Telekom 
employees were registered on this platform. Via Percipio, our 
employees can access training materials offered by Coursera, the 
world’s largest provider of online courses at university level. The 
courses, on issues such as big data, cybersecurity, cloud, and arti-
ficial intelligence, are provided by a network of around 200 univer-
sities.
The employees’ initiative Learning from Experts (LEX), which was 
launched in 2018 and is now successfully established at Deutsche 
Telekom, provides another example of the opportunities we offer 
for self-managed, self-guided learning. In LEX, experts from the 
Group share knowledge with their colleagues via a range of differ-
ent channels. LEX is one of our fastest-growing communities. Its 
LEX sessions, lasting 30 to 60 minutes, are especially popular. 
More than 20 000 LEX sessions had been held by the end of 2023.
Throughout the Group (not including T-Mobile US), our employees 
completed some 3.8 million hours of learning in 2023, as invest-
ments in their own personal and professional development. 
Slightly over half of these hours were devoted to acquiring techni-
cal and digital skills. Overall, LEX users completed a total of almost 
2.8 million hours of online learning in 2023. The comparable figure 
for 2019 was only 1.8 million. In 2023, fully 88 percent of the train-
ing courses available for registration throughout the Group were 
available online.  
Training and skills management
We are aiming to develop Deutsche Telekom into a skills-focused 
company that orients its learning and development programs, and 
its pertinent processes, completely to its employees’ skills require-
ments.
We are continually building and upgrading our skills management 
program. With the help of a special, smart tool, skills management 
supports us in identifying skills gaps, throughout the Group. It thus 
enables us to offer targeted, focused continuing training and edu-
cation programs for our employees. We tailor our learning pro-
grams to the skills gaps we identify. Also, we show our employees 
skills profiles that they can aim for, and achieve, by developing 
their skills. Since 2023, following a successful pilot program that 
began in 2017 and reached several units, we have been running 
our skills management program interdepartmentally, throughout 
the Group. To date, some 46 000 employees have successfully 
completed the skills management program.
Strengthening leadership skills in the digital age
In our management and leadership development programs, we are 
also increasingly relying on virtual solutions. The aim of such pro-
grams is to strengthen virtual leadership skills. 
In 2021, we introduced WeGrow, a new approach to performance 
development, for employees at Deutsche Telekom in Germany and 
at T-Systems’ Local Business Units (LBUs), and subsequently rolled 
it out in other companies as well. By building on regular feedback, 
this process will help us enhance our employees’ development and 
commitment, create clarity about tasks and expected results, and 
strengthen trust-based relationships between managers and 
employees. 
In addition, it will dovetail closely with other HR processes, such as 
skills management, talent management, and succession planning 
– and thereby help us tackle the challenges we face as a company. 
Since 2023, we have also been using WeGrow in our career devel-
opment meetings with employees covered by collective agree-
ments and with civil servants.
Talent management at Deutsche Telekom
Deutsche Telekom completely overhauled its approach to talent 
management in 2022. The aim was to garner a holistic, Group-
wide view of talents at Deutsche Telekom. This is enabling us to a) 
develop centralized talent initiatives for all employees, and b) sup-
plement those initiatives with local initiatives tailored to the spe-
cific requirements of the particular business unit involved in each 
case. For us, all employee groups harbor talents, including employ-
ees covered or not covered by collective agreements, and execu-
tives. WeGrow, our Group-wide performance development 
approach, serves as our basis for identifying talents. WeGrow, pro-
viding for ongoing dialog between managers and employees, is 
designed to further our employees’ development and help us iden-
tify talents. To this end, we have developed common, clearly 
defined, and comparable talent criteria – summarized by “4 As,” 
standing for Achievement, Ambition, Attitude, and Ability. As the 
4 As suggest, in addition to reviewing previous achievements and 
Management & facts

existing skills, we also consider whether employees have the nec-
essary ambition and attitude for inclusion in talent initiatives. 
All our initiatives aim to develop suitable talents towards positions 
that add value to the Group. To this end, we network talents and 
managers, create transparency regarding our talent pool, and pro-
mote direct contact with prospective hiring managers.
In the WeGrow framework, we hold annual “People Days” events. 
They bring management teams together for discussion aimed at 
identifying talents among the employees under their responsibil-
ity. At these meetings, a holistic, forward-looking evaluation pro-
cess is applied that takes account of aspects such as performance, 
values-based skills, and potential future development. 
The “Executives and Prospective Executives” target group is pro-
moted via the Global Talent Hub, a globally operated talent initia-
tive that includes up to 200 talented people who are directly 
suited for, and aiming for, an executive position in the company. 
Since 2022, the Hub also includes up to 100 talents who, early on 
in their careers, have already shown that they have the necessary 
potential to reach the executive level. This group receives extra 
support throughout a series of several career steps. In the report-
ing year, 22 percent of the company’s executive positions (exclud-
ing positions at T-Mobile US) were filled with talents from the 
Global Talent Hub.
Also in the reporting year, our work in the area of training and 
development was honored with a number of awards.
1 Due to a system and methodology adjustment in 2023, the figure 
is only comparable with the figures from previous years to a lim-
ited extent.
Careers at Deutsche Telekom
With more than 200 000 employees in 34 countries, Deutsche 
Telekom is one of the leading telecommunication companies 
worldwide. Our employees are shaping the digital world of tomor-
row, often performing pioneering work.
We constantly monitor the increasing demand for skilled workers, 
particularly IT and tech experts, and compete for the best talents. 
With our targeted recruitment programs, we give school and uni-
versity students, graduates, and experienced hires a variety of 
options for immersing themselves in the Magenta world, including 
apprenticeships, dual study programs, internships, trainee pro-
grams, and expert entry. 
In 2023, in Germany, we launched Magenta Campus Team, an 
effort aimed at coordinating our many different cooperative rela-
tionships with universities and at intensifying our dialog with stu-
dents and graduates outside of the company’s sphere. In this 
framework, we began inviting junior staff to excursions and expert 
presentations that offer an opportunity to become better 
acquainted with the company. Also, we continued our annual cam-
pus tours, under a new concept. We offered students and gradu-
ates the opportunity to meet with our IT and tech experts, in 
relaxed settings with snacks and games. In the reporting year, and 
in this context, we visited a total of eight universities in Germany – 
and got to meet many of the country’s up-and-coming skilled staff. 
In addition, the “Community of University Experts” was founded in 
2023 as a platform for the exchange of information and the scaling 
of measures within the framework of university cooperation within 
the European Telekom subsidiaries.
With state-of-the-art workplace concepts, comprehensive code-
termination options, and a broad range of training and develop-
ment, we are moving toward our aim of becoming the “Leading 
Digital Telco.”
We offer our employees a broad, flexible benefits package that lets 
them shape their careers and personal lives individually, in keeping 
with their specific needs and objectives. Examples include flexible 
working hours, hybrid working models, and part-time employ-
ment, as well as lifetime work accounts, risk cover, and support 
with caregiving for family members. Our mission as a responsible 
employer also includes fair, competitive remuneration, with 
options for performance-based variable components, as well as 
a generous pension scheme. In addition, our Share2you program 
gives employees the option to purchase employee shares at spe-
cial conditions: when they buy two employee shares, they receive 
a third one free of charge. Other benefits, such as sustainable 
mobility solutions and extensive health promotion, round out our 
offerings. More information about this is available on our careers 
website.
We have special offers for career starters, such as our “Start up!” 
trainee program. Our Start up! trainees spend a total of 18 months 
getting to know the different units at Deutsche Telekom. In the 
process, they gain extensive insights into our multinational corpo-
ration. In each case, the program has a focus topic, but can be ori-
ented to a trainee’s specific needs. 
Also, our Software Academy’s re-skilling program, which launched 
in 2022, offers participants – including even those without any 
prior IT experience – the opportunity to train as software develop-
ers. Our 12-month DiscoverMINT orientation program offers 
young people in Germany career orientation and an opportunity to 
familiarize themselves with the digital workplace, and its promise.
Systems Solutions segment: training and development 
T-Systems supports the personal and professional development 
of its employees with a broad range of customizable training and 
development programs. Also, it provides its junior staff with 
special support while they are still new to the workplace.
Training and development programs, for acquisition 
of key tech skills 
In the reporting year, T-Systems continued running “youlearn,” a 
Group-wide initiative launched in 2020. Also, it emphasized “Digi-
tize!,” a company-wide skills-development campaign. The compa-
ny’s management is giving the initiative top strategic priority for 
the next few years. Digitize! comprises several programs that help 
employees develop key technology skills needed in managing cus-

tomers’ digital transformations. The programs include digital train-
ing on topics such as artificial intelligence (AI) and big data, as well 
as the part-time programs Digital Engineer, Data Scientist, Digital 
Consultant, and Digital Expert of Tomorrow, which are offered in 
cooperation with RWTH Aachen University. In addition, a “Career 
Shifter” module helps employees reskill for IT roles – including 
complex roles such as “cloud backend engineer” or “cloud archi-
tect hyperscaler.” In terms of prerequisites, the programs are 
aimed at a wide range of persons, including persons with no prior 
experience, persons with IT experience and solid tech skills, and 
experts on digitalization. Wherever possible, courses are offered 
internationally. For the most part, the programs are presented 
online, for self-directed learning, but they also include in-person 
classroom training at participants’ own locations. While all of these 
reskilling and upskilling measures are managed centrally, they are 
carried out in close cooperation with the relevant business units 
(departments, teams of experts). With them, T-Systems is seeking 
to develop itself as an organization that promotes self-directed 
learning. For this reason, it welcomes and supports learning/devel-
opment initiatives that its units develop on their own. In the report-
ing year, all such initiatives were again successful. 
To date, some 2 815 employees, representing a total of 25 portfo-
lio units, have taken part in Digitize! since it was introduced. In the 
reporting year, employees earned 3 834 certifications, in a total of 
39 strategic skill clusters. In the process, a total of 1 000 certifica-
tions were earned in key cloud services such as Amazon Web Ser-
vices (AWS) – and T-Systems won the Digital Revolution Award for 
its outstanding efforts on behalf of the digital transformation.
In 2023, and for the second time in succession, T-Systems pre-
sented its “Learning Hero Award,” which is designed to promote a 
culture of learning throughout the company. The award is given to 
“Learning Heroes” within the company who have carried out espe-
cially interesting and useful initiatives in the area of learning and 
teaching. In 2023, nine winners were selected, from a total of 184 
candidates (representing 13 different countries), in the three cate-
gories “Individual,” “Multiplier,” and “Teams.” The winners received 
prizes, including both non-cash and cash prizes, worth up to 5 000 
euros. The 2023 Learning Heroes’ efforts were publicized both 
within and outside the company.
Promoting junior staff
T-Systems offers special programs for career starters, such as a 
Graduate Program. In that program, which begins in May and 
October of each year, participants move through a range of learn-
ing phases and practical assignments, over a five-month period. 
Mentors support participants in developing their skills and in navi-
gating their entry into the workplace. In designing the program, 
T-Systems cooperates with leading universities.
T-Systems also works to promote STEM (science, technology, 
engineering, mathematics) skills outside of the company. For 
instance, it is a founding partner of 42 Berlin, a coding academy 
that opened in early December 2022. The academy has no profes-
sors, exams, or lectures. Instead, it creates a framework in which 
students can develop their own projects, individually and in 
groups. Age, origin, and previous education are explicitly ignored; 
everyone gets a chance to start programming. 42 Berlin’s program 
also calls for participants to put what they learn to practical use. In 
the reporting year, T-Systems hired eight program participants as 
interns. And two of those persons, who came aboard in March, 
have since been employed on a regular, permanent basis. T-Sys-
tems has appointed six experts, known as “Fellows,” to represent 
T-Systems and Deutsche Telekom to educational institutions, 
assist and guide interns, and carry out mentoring events.
Talent and skills management
“WeGrow”, the Group-wide performance management format, 
promotes employees’ personal and professional development and 
helps identify especially promising junior staff – “talents.” In the 
WeGrow framework in 2023, T-Systems launched the global 
Talents@T-Systems program. This initiative is aimed at supporting 
talents in developing their careers, networking with leading indus-
try figures and collaborating internationally. In the reporting year, a 
total of 2 000 employees participated in the program.
In its HR work, T-Systems keeps track of the changing market, and 
it invests efficiently in development of key skills needed to meet 
future requirements. Throughout the year, to support employees 
and management staff in their personal development, in the con-
text of the digital age, the company highlighted the different 
career paths available within the organization, and gave them a 
sharper defining profile. This effort is now proving especially useful 
for T-Systems employees in the areas of consulting, software engi-
neering, IT architecture, and project management.
Training program for cybersecurity professionals 
IT security experts are still in short supply on the German labor 
market, which is why, in 2014, we developed a 2.5-year, part-time 
training program leading to certification as a cybersecurity profes-
sional (certified by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry). The 
program is integrated into regular work processes and supple-
mented by subject-related and general modules in a variety of for-
mats (classroom courses, e-learning, blended learning). After suc-
cessfully passing the examination at the relevant Chamber of 
Industry and Commerce (IHK), participants receive an IHK certifi-
cate as a cybersecurity professional. For the skills they have 
acquired as part of the training, they can obtain credits that can be 
used in bachelor’s or master’s programs. During the reporting year, 
19 participants passed the exams to become certified cybersecu-
rity professionals at the Cologne Chamber of Industry and Com-
merce (IHK Köln).
We are continuously developing our training programs, taking into 
account current and future IT security requirements. For example, 
in the reporting year, we updated and expanded all program con-
tent in keeping with the latest developments in the area of artificial 
intelligence (AI). 
In 2018, in response to demand that emerged at other companies 
and at government agencies, we opened up the program to 
employees of other organizations. In 2023, the program entered 
its tenth year, with a total of 14 participants. They include staff of 
Management & facts

Deutsche Telekom Security GmbH (ten persons), Deutsche 
Telekom IT GmbH (two persons) and Deutsche Telekom Geschäft-
skunden GmbH (two persons). 
Graduates of the program are increasingly taking on the role of 
expert coaches for the new participants, documenting the positive 
rating of the program and supporting its development. In the 
reporting year, the expert coaches from the program’s seventh 
class (year) were certified. They were able to expand their skills 
through a course entitled “Fit for expert coaching” and even put 
them to the test in the practical implementation of the program. 
During the same year, and on the occasion of the program’s tenth 
anniversary, over 120 program graduates and expert coaches 
gathered for an in-person alumni meeting. In addition to featuring 
presentations on current IT-security issues, the gathering offered 
plenty of opportunity for discussion and sharing of experience. The 
overall aim of the event was to promote the further development 
of the company’s professional cybersecurity community and to 
strengthen its network. 
After ten years of the program, we can report that our experience 
with it has been very positive. As of March 2023, seven classes had 
completed the training in full and received the pertinent certifica-
tion. The average age of the graduates was approximately 24. At 
5.7 percent, the dropout rate among participants was low. The 
course was described as challenging, but manageable in the con-
text of the growing requirements of everyday working life. In total, 
we have had 152 program participants, in ten classes. 96.4 per-
cent of the graduates from the classes of 2014 through 2020 
remained in the Deutsche Telekom workforce.
Skills development at Telekom Training
Deutsche Telekom offers its employees a range of training 
designed to help them to develop and brush up their skills. 
In 2023, we offered a total of 47 005 learning programs via our 
global Learning Management System (LMS). 88 percent of these 
programs were available online. On average, our employees in 
Germany and at our European Local Business Units (LBUs) 
invested 4.6 working days in their professional education, 3.4 of 
which were digital. During the reporting year, the percentage of 
learning carried out online decreased to 73 percent (2022: 
79 percent).
International development and leadership programs
Our international development and leadership programs are 
designed to help high potentials and top performers establish 
themselves within the Group, to foster their loyalty to the com-
pany, and to position them in suitable jobs. These programs focus 
on developing the upcoming leader generation and supporting it 
in addressing current and future challenges. At the same time, the 
programs have the purposes of enhancing leaders’ identification 
with the company, promoting their knowledge-focused exchanges 
and interactions and cultivating their sense of personal responsi-
bility.
The Start up! trainee program runs four times a year, offering 
ambitious and outstanding graduates from various disciplines a 
chance to become the pioneering experts and leaders of the digi-
tal future. Trainees who are driven by an entrepreneurial spirit, a 
game-changer mentality, and a digital mindset can tailor their 
18-month learning journey to their specific needs and interests. 
By immersing them in a fascinating exploration of the different 
business areas in Germany and abroad, the program offers an 
opportunity to gain practical experience from a series of challeng-
ing projects and customer-centric tasks supported by experienced 
leaders.
In addition, the Global Talent Hub serves as a pipeline for high 
potentials at Deutsche Telekom, which helps them develop into a 
leadership role or toward the next level – directly or with a step in 
between. It is an incubator and launchpad that gives talents visibil-
ity on a Group level, connects them with relevant business leaders 
across segments, and helps accelerate their careers to become 
key players in the future.

tent is combined into a harmonized learning experience for all 
leaders. In the reporting year, levelUP! successfully acquired 4 000 
new users from all segments and is now providing information to 
more than 8 500 leaders in total.
Apprentices and training programs in the DT Group 
in Germany
In 2023, a total of some 5 350 junior staff underwent training, or 
took part in a dual study program, at the company. Of these, 22 
percent were women.
Employee recruitment in the DT Group in Germany
In 2023, Deutsche Telekom hired around 2 500 new employees 
from the external labor market in Germany. In addition, we gave 
around 1 300 internal junior staff permanent jobs on completion of 
their vocational training or dual study courses.
Proportion of digital experts
Our workforce’s in-depth expertise and future-centric skills are a 
vital company resource and pivotal to our business success. 
Deutsche Telekom prioritizes the promotion of future-proof digital 
skills. In 2023, we reiterated our commitment to improving 
employability by offering our Explorer Journeys – intensive pro-
grams focusing on up-and-coming innovation areas. More than 8 
200 employees attended these digital training events lasting sev-
eral weeks, covering topics such as generative AI, data analytics 
and data visualization, machine learning, and software develop-
ment.

Our approach to health and occupational safety 
We take our obligation to ensure the health and safety of our 
employees very seriously. The Board of Management assumes 
overall responsibility for occupational health and safety, as well as 
for environmental protection. We bundle and manage our occupa-
tional health and safety programs at Group level; health and safety 
managers (H&S managers) are responsible for implementing these 
programs locally. The general responsibilities, duties and programs 
for health and safety management are outlined in the Manage-
ment System Manual for Quality, Health, Safety and Environmental 
Protection. The manual serves to harmonize and align our manage-
ment systems with common targets across the Group. Our Condi-
tions for Purchasing also include agreements on occupational 
health and safety, which our suppliers must fulfill.
Occupational health and safety in the Group is firmly anchored in 
our structures, through certified management systems and suita-
ble policies and guidelines. We conform to the ISO 45001 stand-
ard in this connection. In 2018, we were one of the first DAX-listed 
companies to have our H&S management system certified accord-
ing to the standard. Before that, we had been certified to OHSAS 
18001 from 2011. In 2023, our H&S management system, which 
is certified pursuant to ISO 45001, ISO 14001 and ISO 9001, 
underwent a successful review. Deutsche Telekom’s umbrella cer-
tificates for occupational health and safety, environmental protec-
tion, and quality are slated for review and recertification in 2024. 
At the end of the 2023 financial year, 18 sites were certified pursu-
ant to ISO 9001, 89 sites pursuant to ISO 14001, and 83 sites pur-
suant to ISO 45001. The certificates certify that we have system-
atic procedures and processes in place to ensure and continually 
improve occupational health and safety as well as environmental 
protection.
We promote health awareness and health literacy among our 
employees, with targeted measures and comprehensive programs. 
At the same time, safety in the workplace is our highest priority. 
We view legally mandated occupational health and safety stand-
ards as minimum requirements. Awareness-raising, prevention, 
and personal responsibility are of particular importance to us. For 
this reason, we offer training courses on all relevant topics, such as 
first-aid, fire safety, and driver safety.
We regularly determine risks to health and safety. We produce risk 
assessments for all activities and use them to derive appropriate 
measures – such as mandatory fire safety instructions for all 
employees. When we collaborate with external service providers, it 
is important that our safety standards be met.
Our portfolio of occupational health and safety measures also 
includes many voluntary measures to promote health within the 
company. These include, for example:
	
An annual, comprehensive health check by company doctors
	
Vaccinations and hygiene measures
	
Colon cancer screening
	
Exercise/fitness activities
	
Programs for recovery and resilience, mindfulness, health-ori-
ented leadership
	
Increasingly, digital training
In the reporting year, we received a number of awards for our 
efforts on behalf of in-company health promotion. For example, for 
our “One Minute to Arrive” mindfulness initiative, we were honored 
as an “Employee Wellbeing Champion” (award: Special Mention). 
With “One Minute to Arrive,” we encourage our employees to take 
a minute to pause and reflect at the beginning of every meeting. In 
that minute, participants are encouraged to concentrate on the 
moment – while also taking note of their breathing, if they wish – 
and thereby become better able to open the meeting in a col-
lected and focused manner. The initiative, which is being offered in 
the context of New Work, is an organizational development meas-
ure aimed at enhancing everyday working life. In the EU segment, 
the OTE Group received several awards for its “Health & Safety” 
initiatives. The group was honored for its efforts to promote a 
workplace culture of health and safety, for example, and for its 
development of individualized programs for promoting employees’ 
physical and mental health and their overall well-being. Also, in the 
area of occupational safety, a first aid app introduced in the Ger-
many segment received the German Stevie Award. More informa-
tion on the application is available here.
The impact assessment of our materiality analysis identified 
potential risks to health and safety in the work and process steps 
of Deutsche Telekom’s upstream and downstream value chains. 
Insufficient hygienic measures, deficient safeguards, and a lack of 
preventive measures can result in accidents or damage to 
employee health. Our measures to improve occupational health 
and safety are aimed at reducing these risks. They also have a pos-
itive effect on the environment. A structured occupational safety 
process for handling hazardous materials, for example, ensures 
that hazardous materials cannot leak out or pose a risk to the envi-
ronment.

Effectiveness of our occupational health and safety measures 
In line with the PDCA cycle (plan, do, check, act), we systemati-
cally investigate and measure the effectiveness of our measures. 
We endeavor to continuously develop and enhance our manage-
ment system. To this end, we regularly investigate how occupa-
tional health and safety are integrated in management and leader-
ship activities and derive improvement strategies as needed. This 
includes reviewing the results of our employee survey, evaluating 
stress prevention measures under collective agreements, competi-
tor analyses, and other indicators. We analyze this information on 
an ongoing basis and use it to develop suitable measures to pro-
mote the health and well-being of our employees. In addition, all 
employees can actively help shape our measures for occupational 
health and safety, in line with the requirements of ISO 45001.
Different indicators reflect the effectiveness of our corporate 
health management activities:
	
At Deutsche Telekom in Germany, the health rate (including 
long-term illnesses) in the reporting year was 94.3 percent 
(prior year: 93.8 percent). Excluding long-term illnesses, the 
health rate over the same period was 95.8 percent (prior year: 
95.2 percent). The health rate is reported to the Board of Man-
agement at the end of each quarter.
	
The total number of accidents at work remained at a low level 
in the reporting year. In 2023, the accident rate in Germany 
was 5.2 accidents (accidents resulting in more than three days 
of absence) per thousand employees (prior year: 5.5). 
	
The Group-wide health index – which was most recently deter-
mined in connection with the 2021 employee survey, in nearly 
all countries with Deutsche Telekom employees – was 69 (on a 
scale of 0 to 100). This represents a slight increase of four 
points with respect to the previous survey in 2019. Prepara-
tions for determining the next health index began in 2023.
In the fall of 2023, the company’s annual flu-shot campaign again 
took place. Between October and December 2023, some 6 800 of 
our employees in Germany received their flu shots via the cam-
paign. 
While we did not offer COVID-19 vaccinations in 2023, we did 
monitor and assess the coronavirus situation on an ongoing basis. 
As a result, we would be in a position to resume our COVID-19 
vaccination program as necessary, on short notice.

Psychosocial support in connection with personal and profes-
sional changes
We attach great importance to the psychosocial support that the 
Employee and Executive Advisory Service (MFB) provides for vari-
ous transformation processes across the Group. The goal is to help 
affected employees, managers, and teams deal with professional 
and private changes, and to prevent psychosocial crises. In the 
event of an acute crisis, our crisis intervention takes action: The 
party concerned, along with family members when needed, can 
make use of professional counseling from an experienced team of 
experts.
In Germany, we also offer free and anonymous personal coun-
seling and consultation hours. Via the service, company employ-
ees can consult healthcare professionals (employed by healthcare 
providers) – in person, either at the professionals’ own locations or 
at Deutsche Telekom facilities. And consultations can also be initi-
ated and conducted via telephone calls, video chats, messaging 
and email. Employees can also contact health professionals via the 
“Talk Time” telephone helpline, which as of 2023 is available on a 
24/7 basis to deal with both urgent and non-urgent situations. If 
necessary, employees seeking help are referred directly to local 
experts or specialist agencies. The counselors have a duty to main-
tain confidentiality and are familiar with the specifics of the com-
pany. 
As of 2023, the Talk Time helpline is also available to employees 
outside of Germany, including employees in Greece, the UK, the 
Czech Republic and Türkiye. In 2024, the service will be extended 
to additional countries.
Since 2022, we have offered special psychosocial counseling to 
our international employees and helpers who have been exposed 
to stresses and disturbing events tied to Russia’s war of aggression 
on Ukraine. In the reporting year, we also provided this free service 
to employees who have experienced other catastrophic events – 
such as the earthquakes that struck Türkiye and Syria in February 
2023, and the war in the Middle East. In addition, the free, individ-
ual counseling offered by the service is not limited to our own 
employees; it is also open to employees’ family members and 
friends on location. Our counselors, working across international 
boundaries, offer victims, persons in mourning and persons seek-
ing advice support in dealing with anxiety, fear, and other mental 
stresses. Also, the service is available in several different lan-
guages, including Turkish, Arabic, and Hebrew.

Via our Employee and Executive Advisory Service (MFB), we have 
long provided special additional support to managers, in the form 
of presentations and workshops on healthy leadership, conflict 
management, mindfulness, and self-leadership, as well as on strat-
egies for dealing with changes and mental stress.
Courses on virtual leadership are also part of these offerings. 
Working in hybrid or distributed teams has long been part of eve-
ryday life for some parts of Deutsche Telekom. During the pan-
demic, however, as more and more people worked from home, 
managers, who need to stay in touch with the teams and individu-
als under them and be aware of any relevant changes, faced the 
additional challenge of finding enough time and opportunity for 
personal interaction. In many cases, this meant relying on regular 
video conferences. As of the end of 2023, our office staff are 
increasingly leaving their home offices and again working at com-
pany facilities. Teamwork at our various locations has been benefit-
ting from the intensified personal interaction that in-office work 
makes possible.

Digitalization and health
For many years now, we have offered our employees a compre-
hensive range of programs to help them stay healthy and fit, and 
sharp and motivated, as they face the challenges of the increas-
ingly digital and agile modern workplace.
The “My Health Journey” health program
In the reporting year, we continued our My Health Journey com-
pany health program for mental resilience, which is available to all 
employees in Germany. In addition to a series of workshops on 
developing mental resilience, mindfulness and good self-care hab-
its, it provides science-based mindfulness training for managers 
and executives. The program also now includes modules covering 
all fields of prevention. In addition to the focus topic “Mental resil-
ience,” we now also offer courses on good nutrition, regular exer-
cise, and restful sleep. And the program also includes open lec-
tures, and on-demand individual counseling on topics such as 
sleep and nutrition.
In the reporting year, an online “#mymoment” area once again 
offered our employees in Germany live workshops, video clips and 
handouts, all oriented to the topic of cultivating mindfulness in the 
workplace.
Since 2021, a training course entitled “Healthy, mindful leader-
ship” has been available to managers and executives in nearly all 
of our German companies. This is a multimodal course designed to 
improve the digital health literacy of employees. In the reporting 
year, the course curriculum focused especially on dealing with the 
challenges of “New Work”. For example, it covered topics such as 
hybrid leadership, meaningfulness, and empathy. The “Healthy, 
mindful leadership” training course began in 2019 as a pilot pro-
ject.
In addition, since 2020 our employees in Germany have access to 
the FITMIT5 (fitwith5) app which is also integrated in the annual 
My Health Journey program. The training app includes an algo-
rithm that puts together five-minute workout programs tailored to 
users’ needs. In addition, it provides further exercise and medita-
tion resources, as well as a nutritional tips. In light of the positive 
feedback received, this offer was continued in the reporting year 
and is now available to all company employees free of charge. We 
also launched a collaboration with SHENTISPORTS in 2022 that 
enables our business customers to offer the FITMIT5 app to their 
own employees.
Other offerings and action days  
In 2023, we again held “action days,” or campaigns devoted to 
specific topics, for our employees. These included a Mindfulness 
Day, a Mental Health Day, a Sleep Day and a Nutrition Day. In some 
cases, the campaigns were conducted in several different lan-
guages. 
Our Mindfulness Day, which took place in September 2023, fea-
tured a diverse supporting program entitled “The Power in Small 
Habits.” Action day activities for our employees included online 
meditation and yoga; presentations on the challenges of the mod-
ern workplace; and presentations on strategies for dealing with 
digital technologies. In connection with our “Mental Health Day,” 
which took place in October 2023, we offered our employees a full 
week of webinars and expert presentations on topics such as resil-
ience, self-care, and self-empathy. In addition, they had the oppor-
tunity to take part in a range of practical exercises, such as breath-
training and short-meditation exercises. We view our efforts to 
promote mental health among our employees also as efforts to 
promote a positive corporate culture.
Our “Sleep Day,” which was held in June 2023, presented a wealth 
of information about sleep, including both restful nighttime sleep 
and sleep disorders. The presentation formats included numerous 
webinars and a virtual tour through a 3D sleep-obstacle course. 
The Day presented both general information, about the topics of 
sleep and rest, and tips and strategies on ways of improving one’s 
own individual sleep. 
The latter included information based on the latest findings from 
sleep research. To that end, in Germany we drew on the “Healthy 
Sleep” campaign, which developed from T-Systems’ “#aus-
ruhezeichen,” a sleep and rest campaign launched in 2020. At the 
end of the reporting year, the three-year pilot phase of “#aus-
ruhezeichen” also ended, with positive results. For example, 
employees who had taken part in the sleep coaching offered via 
the campaign reported that their sleeping habits had improved as 
a result. As of 2024, as a result of the campaign’s great success, 
we are offering a diverse range of similar measures to all Deutsche 
Telekom employees in Germany. In 2022, one Deutsche Telekom 
location in Bonn set aside a room in which employees could spend 
short periods sleeping or resting. The pilot phase of this arrange-
ment proved to be such a success that the room has been kept “in 
operation.” The room, which features a rest area, and a day bed for 
power naps, is available to all employees working at the location.

About nutrition, another health topic: Since 2021, we have been 
working with BARMER, a health-insurance provider, to provide 
online presentations by nutrition consultants and top athletes, as 
well as team workshops and added offerings such as Weight 
Watchers Online throughout the Group.

Digital solutions for occupational safety 
To be effective, occupational safety management has to stay up to 
date. Even though our employees and managers work at many dif-
ferent locations, and often work remotely, they should still have 
easy access to our occupational safety programs. For this reason, 
Deutsche Telekom is working to digitalize and simplify the relevant 
core processes. For example, assessments of physical and techni-
cal hazards have been managed digitally in Germany since 2023. 
Also, since 2015 the Group has been preparing assessments of 
risks to mental health in digital form. Also, the company has set up 
an online portal for reporting of accidents and near-accidents.
In 2023, we introduced interactive, web-based training courses on 
such subjects, to ensure we are reaching all of our highly mobile 
workforce. As of August 2023, employees throughout the Group 
have online access to information about a range of key topics in 
this area, such as fire safety; safe traffic routes; proper use of tab-
lets by field-service staff; and healthy, safe use of computer dis-
plays. Participants automatically receive certification of their par-
ticipation in a course that complies with legal requirements. For 
executives and managers, we have also introduced a mandatory 
training course entitled “Management skills in occupational health 
and safety.” The digital content in this area is barrier-free – mean-
ing it can also be easily accessed by persons with disabilities – 
and it is available in both English and German. We plan to gradu-
ally expand our range of online instruction in this area. 
Also in 2023, we launched, on a Group-wide basis, a dedicated 
first aid app. All Deutsche Telekom employees are invited to install 
it on their work devices. In any emergency situations at Deutsche 
Telekom locations, they can use it to quickly alert nearby first 
responders, which the app automatically locates via GPS tracking. 
Significantly, this location feature can be especially valuable in 
hybrid work environments.

Health rate
In Germany, the health rate for the Deutsche Telekom Group in 
2023 showed a slight improvement of 0.5 percentage points year-
on-year, and stood at an average of 94.3 percent (including the 
long-term sick). Musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory diseases, 
and mental health problems account for the bulk of illness-related 
absenteeism at Deutsche Telekom.
Not including the long-term sick, the company’s 2023 health rate 
amounted to 95.8 percent, which is slightly higher – by 0.4 per-
centage points – than the value for the previous year. The health 
rate is reported to the Board of Management at the end of each 
quarter. The company aims to increase its health rate.
Targeted health protection programs were implemented in the 
individual companies. Across all segments, management training 
courses on the topic of “healthy leadership” were either introduced 
or continued. The aim is to raise managers’ awareness of this issue 
and train them accordingly. Additionally, a structured absence 
management system will be put in place to ensure that employees 
and managers regularly communicate about illness-related 
absences so that appropriate action can be taken early on.

Work-related accidents in Germany
In the reporting year, the number of workplace and commuting 
accidents remained at a low level. The accident rate in Germany 
for 2023 was 5.2 accidents (resulting in over three days of 
absence) per thousand employees, which continues to be below 
the industry average.
Deutsche Telekom has an occupational health and safety manage-
ment system pursuant to ISO 45001 in place to reduce the num-
ber of work-related accidents. This certified system makes it possi-
ble to map the entire health and safety process and to develop 
sets of measures to further improve employee safety.

Workforce development worldwide 
As per year-end, the Group’s headcount had decreased by 3.4 per-
cent year-on-year. In our Germany segment, the number of 
employees increased by 1.2 percent against year-end 2022, 
mainly due to the transfer of employees of Multimedia Solutions 
(MMS) from the Systems Solutions segment. The total number of 
full-time equivalent employees in the United States segment 
decreased by 6.6 percent compared to the end of 2022, primarily 
due to the workforce reduction program implemented in the third 
quarter of 2023. In the Europe segment, the headcount was down 
by 3.4 percent compared to the end of the prior year, in particular 
in Slovakia, Poland, and Greece. The headcount at our Systems 
Solutions segment was down 5.0 percent against year-end 2022, 
mainly due to the transfer of MMS to the Germany segment. In the 
Group Development segment, the headcount decreased sharply 
by 87.0 percent year-on-year, mainly due to the sale of GD Towers 
as of February 1, 2023. The headcount in the Group Headquarters 
& Group Services segment was down 0.9 percent compared to the 
end of 2022, mainly due to the ongoing staff restructuring meas-
ures at Vivento. This decrease was offset by the increase in the 
number of employees in the Technology and Innovation depart-
ment.
Deutsche Telekom workforce from 2003 to 2023
Our strategy to become the leading telecommunications provider 
in Europe is reflected in the trend in our international employee 
headcount. Since 2003, our workforce in Germany has been 
decreasing continuously. As of the end of 2023, it accounted for 
39.4 percent of the total workforce. There was hardly any change 
with respect to the previous year, however, since our international 
workforce also continued to decrease.

Socially responsible staff restructuring
With a view to remaining strong and competitive in our dynamic 
and global market environment, in the long term, we support and 
assist our employees in growing with the evolving digitalized 
working world.
These inevitable changes are also accompanied by complex per-
sonnel restructuring. We are creating new jobs in growth areas and 
finding qualified personnel to fill these positions. In other areas, we 
are restructuring, and reducing our workforce in the process. We 
make sure that all staff restructuring measures are implemented in 
a socially responsible way for our employees.
HR service provider Vivento has provided us with support and 
placement services for employees in Germany since 2013. In 
2023, and in close collaboration with the new “next.JOB” unit 
founded at the start of 2022, 276 employees (civil servants and 
non-civil servants) at Deutsche Telekom in Germany decided to 
transfer to permanent positions in the public service .The majority 
of them moved to the Federal Employment Agency, but also to the 
armed forces (Bundeswehr) , and other federal authorities. In addi-
tion, employees were placed in individual positions in other public 
administrations. This was also facilitated by the increasing need for 
staff at the authorities. The “next.JOB” unit in Vivento offers public 
service prospects to employees in Germany who are looking for a 
new professional challenge outside the company. Since Vivento’s 
founding, it has helped more than 53 600 employees (full-time 
equivalents – FTEs; as of December 31, 2023) find viable new 
options.
For some years now, various segments, including Group Head-
quarters and Telekom Deutschland, have offered assistance to 
surplus personnel, including individual counseling for professional 
reorientation. Employees in the change process are given prompt 
and comprehensive support, with the goal of finding permanent 
new employment for them.
Holistic staff restructuring and transfer management 
at Telekom Deutschland
Telekom Deutschland implemented a holistic staff restructuring 
and transfer management system in mid-2017. Its aim is to win 
employees over to the idea of a career change early on. In cases 
where tasks are being eliminated in the near or medium term, or 
different skills are required, the affected employees will be given 
advice proactively regarding opportunities for a professional reori-
entation. Managers are also actively involved in the change pro-
cess. Together with them, internal and external employment 
options are considered and personal labor market profiles devel-
oped. In addition, assistance is provided for individualized applica-
tion processes and – where necessary – training offered. Since 
2018, around 2 600 employees nationwide in the Germany seg-
ment have received counseling via this system. Approximately 
70 percent of them were able to find new options through these 
measures.
Instruments for socially responsible staff restructuring 
in the DT Group in Germany
Deutsche Telekom continues to ensure that its personnel cutbacks 
are carried out in a socially responsible manner, using the tried-
and-trusted tools of early retirement, severance payments, and 
partial retirement again in 2023.
Employee turnover rate
In the reporting year, the employee turnover rate in Germany 
remained constant at 2.5 percent. At the international level, the 
turnover rate decreased significantly and was 7.4 percent in 2023. 
At the Group level, it has also reduced as a result of this decrease 
in Germany and was 4.6 percent in 2023.

Proportion of civil servants in Group workforce 
The number of civil servants employed in the company fell once 
again in 2023. The reason for this is that Deutsche Telekom has not 
recruited any new civil servants since the company was privatized. 
While some civil servants left the company upon reaching retire-
ment age, others also took advantage of early retirement with 
volunteer work (dedicated retirement) or moved to other agencies. 
This led to a continuous drop in the number of civil servants in our 
workforce.

We keep on heading for success – with our ideas 
management
Our employees come up with creative ideas for ways to improve 
our processes, products, and services – and thereby strengthen 
Deutsche Telekom’s competitiveness. We promote a corporate 
culture in which we encourage our employees to take an active 
role. We trust in the competency and will of every individual to 
move our company forward. Our Idea Management unit develops 
concepts and measures for making the most of our employees’ 
potential.
Also, in Germany, we maintain an “ideas portal,” and invite any and 
all of our employees to submit ideas through it – acting either 
alone or as part of a team. At the end of March 2023, we shut 
down our central “Ideas Garden” platform. For managing our inter-
nal ideas development, we are now using a decentralized 
approach in which we invite employees, throughout Deutsche 
Telekom’s different areas, to actively develop ideas on their own 
initiative. Ideas that seem well-developed and promising are 
reviewed by our ideas management team, on the basis of various 
criteria. New ideas are also assessed – and implemented, if appro-
priate – by the responsible specialist department. The process, 
which is extensive overall, ensures that each and every idea can be 
individually considered and promoted. Our employees are paid a 
reward for each submitted idea that is pursued.
In 2023, we received a total of 4 516 submissions from our 
employees in Germany (2022: 4 016). These ideas led to savings 
and new business potential worth about 56.4 million euros (2022: 
82.7 million euros). This achievement also shows that we value 
and implement ideas from our employees.
In 2023, Deutsche Telekom took first place in the German Idea 
Management Award in the category “Best solution for 150 years of 
idea management, 2023”. Our ideas management was evaluated 
in the categories “effectiveness,” “impact on the organization” and 
“commitment.”
New impetus with the help of an external think tank 
Via our Ideenschmiede (think tank; only available in German), 
which has been in place since 2018, we invite persons from out-
side the company, including both customers and non-customers, 
to actively help us design our products, services, and processes. 
Around 18 000 users have registered for the site in order to con-
tribute ideas and impetus. Users also have the opportunity to take 
part in surveys, polls, and discussions, and to place suggestions in 
our digital suggestion box. Workshops, both online and in person, 
also give them an opportunity to exchange information with one 
another and with Deutsche Telekom experts, contribute ideas, and 
develop suggestions further. The Ideenschmiede has conducted 
around 450 surveys on 320 different topics since January 2018. 
The results are impressive: in all the topics covered, customer 
feedback has led to the implementation of a project or to measur-
able improvements. In addition, ideas submitted to our suggestion 
box help us continually improve and refine our products and ser-
vices. Since the beginning of 2018, persons outside the company 
have submitted some 6 400 ideas in the Ideenschmiede frame-
work.
In 2023, on the occasion of the Ideenschmiede’s fifth anniversary, 
we held a special online event for employees and selected 
Deutsche Telekom customers. During the event, we took the 
opportunity to honor our employees for the ideas they submitted 
in the year under review. Significantly, intensive exchanges of ideas 
between persons inside and outside of the company have also 
helped encourage our creative employees to keep on submitting 
ideas – in the interest of our business customers’ and consumers’ 
satisfaction.
How customers are changing Deutsche Telekom
The Ideenschmiede primarily serves to solicit requests and 
requirements from customers, elaborate them further, and struc-
ture and document them. All the same, we sometimes let users 
vote on alternative solutions, too. One example involved finding a 
name for the MagentaTV MegaStream rate plan, which was 
decided by a majority vote among users.
Another example of the influence of user feedback involves the 
help website for Cell Broadcast, a topic of current interest. A tar-
geted survey on the Ideenschmiede platform helped us make the 
texts more understandable and answer open questions.
In addition, the Ideenschmiede regularly provides suggestions 
regarding activities and service offerings specifically for older peo-
ple. To make it easier for them to participate in the digital world, 
the Ideenschmiede developed the initial content for a “Tablet for 
beginners” seminar, which we now offer regularly in the Telekom 
Seniors’ Academy framework.
Portfolio of Intellectual Property Rights 
In the reporting year, Deutsche Telekom held a total of 7 875 pat-
ent rights. We are firmly committed to expanding our patent port-
folio, taking relevant current and future technologies into account. 
This will secure the value of our innovations in a dynamic world 
and bolster the Group’s competitiveness. We predominantly 
license our patents through our membership of patent pool.

Patents are gaining more and more significance in the telecommu-
nications industry. Our patent strategy has to keep pace with the 
constant evolution of market players and fields of activity. On the 
one hand, our Group’s scope for action needs to be maintained. On 
the other hand, we want to protect the results of our own research 
and development, and to use these in cooperation and partnership 
with other companies. National and international patent rights are 
vital for these types of activity. We are therefore strongly dedi-
cated to developing, granting, and maintaining  our own patents.

About this report
Deutsche Telekom has been involved in CR reporting for more than 
25 years. In addition to our CR report, we have been publishing a 
non-financial statement in our annual report since reporting year 
2017. As a result, we are fulfilling the requirements of §§ 289c to 
289e HGB (German Commercial Code), §§ 315c in conjunction 
with 289c to 289e German GAAP (HGB) and complying with the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation.
To identify the key reporting topics for our company and stake-
holders, we carry out a comprehensive materiality process each 
year. Our reporting is supplemented by updates in the Corporate 
Responsibility section of our website.
Structure of the online report
The 2023 CR Report is a Communication on Progress that looks at 
the key developments during the reporting period.
	
The home page provides an overview of the most important 
KPIs and highlights relating to the report topics from the year 
2023. From the home page, it is possible to navigate to the dif-
ferent sections of our “Management & Facts” Communication 
on Progress. This covers the four pillars of strategy, economy, 
environment, and social, and includes information relating to 
our sustainability strategy, targets, and progress from the 
reporting year. Under economy, environment, and social, we 
also provide a brief overview of the key progress and KPIs from 
the reporting year. The foreword is presented in the appropri-
ate place in the strategy section. For the first time, the 2023 CR 
report includes information about progress and activities in the 
four operating segments Germany, United States, Europe, and 
Systems Solutions, which have been presented in separate 
Country profiles in previous CR Reports. This new, integrated 
presentation enables us to map out the Group structure better 
in the 2023 CR Report. In some topic areas, interested readers 
are able to contact Deutsche Telekom experts directly.
	
Management & Facts is supplemented with an interactive 
benchmarking tool under “Key figures”, which enables users to 
put together customized sustainability KPIs. The KPIs are pre-
sented at both segment and unit level.

Under Specials, we provide information in an easily under-
standable way for a wide range of readers. The content of the 
Specials is not part of the “Management & Facts” Communica-
tion on Progress. The Specials provide a general overview of 
relevant sustainability topics at Deutsche Telekom. Due to their 
general applicability, they continue to be valid, and have there-
fore not been updated for this reporting year. Some of the Spe-
cials are also available in simplified language.
	
The report is supplemented by the new CR facts format, which 
individual Deutsche Telekom departments use to report 
directly on their sustainability-related projects and measures. 
This format is also not part of the Communication on Progress 
for the reporting year. Readers can access the CR facts section 
at any time by clicking on the link in the report’s footer.
The report’s footer includes links to a download center, dialog 
functions, a glossary, and other relevant websites.
Scope, reporting period, and target groups 
 As a Group report, Deutsche Telekom’s “Management & Facts” 
Communication on Progress and the section on key figures with its 
interactive KPI img tool include the segments and many national 
companies. It covers – like the Annual Report – the period from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023. CR reporting is carried out each 
year, with the 2023 Communication on Progress following up on 
that of 2022. Any deviations are marked accordingly. The date of 
publication is March 26, 2024. This Communication on Progress 
has been compiled in line with the 2021 GRI Standards.
The CR Report pertains to the Group with its 56 German and 238 
international, fully consolidated subsidiaries; any deviations are 
marked accordingly.
This report is specifically addressed to Deutsche Telekom stake-
holders. These include analysts and investors; CR ranking and rat-
ing agencies; NGOs; customers, employees, and business part-
ners; and representatives from the worlds of business, science, 
research, education, and politics.
For purposes of inclusion, we have used gender-neutral terms and 
pronouns.
Implementation of high international reporting standards
The “Management & Facts” Communication on Progress and KPIs 
section comply with the internationally recognized guidelines (GRI 
Standards) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). We also high-
light our contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development 
Goals img in many places. In addition, we use a special index img 
to indicate which content in the 2023 CR Report contributes to 
meeting the criteria established by the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB). For the first time, the 2023 CR Report 
also highlights the negative effects (Principal Adverse Impacts, 
PAIs) from the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) 
and the indicators of the Global System for Mobile Communication 
(GSM) sustainability standards with regard to the telecommunica-
tions industry. The latter standards aim to achieve better compara-
bility in the telecommunications sector. In 2023, we published the

Independent assurance report
Limited Assurance Report of the Independent Practitioner 
Regarding Sustainability Information
To Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn/Germany
Our Engagement
We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the dis-
closures marked with the symbol 
 in the Corporate Responsibil-
ity Report (“sustainability report”) of Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn/
Germany (“the Company”), for the period from 1 January to31 
December 2023 (“sustainability information”). Our engagement 
solely covers the disclosures marked with the symbol 
.
Our engagement does not cover the paragraphs not marked with 
the symbol 
, or other disclosures in the sustainability report of 
the Company. 
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the sustainability report in accordance with the 
principles stated in the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the 
Global Reporting Initiative (“Reporting Criteria”) and for the selec-
tion of the disclosures to be assessed.
These responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company 
include the selection and application of appropriate methods for 
sustainability reporting and the use of assumptions and estimates 
for individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable under 
the given circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are 
responsible for such internal control as they have determined nec-
essary to enable the preparation of a sustainability report that is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudu-
lent sustainability report) or error.
The preciseness and completeness of environmental data in the 
sustainability report is subject to inherent restrictions resulting 
from the way in which the data was collected and calculated and 
from assumptions made.
Independence and Quality Assurance of the Independent 
Practitioner’s Firm
We have complied with the German professional requirements on 
independence as well as other professional conduct requirements.
Our audit img firm applies the national legal rules and professional 
pronouncements – in particular the Profes-sional Code of Conduct 
for German Public Auditors and Sworn Auditors (BS WP/vBP) and 
of the Quality Management Standards issued by the Institute of 
Public Auditors in Germany (IDW), and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive quality management system that includes docu-
mented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with 
professional ethical requirements, professional standards, as well 
as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.
Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the disclosures 
marked with the symbol 
 in the sustainability report based on 
our work performed within our limited assurance engagement.
Our engagement does not cover the paragraphs not marked with 
the symbol 
, or other disclosures in the sustainability report of 
the Company. 
We conducted our work in accordance with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
“Assurance Engagements other than Audits img or Reviews of His-
torical Financial Information”, issued by the IAASB. This Standard 
requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so 
that we can assess with limited assurance whether matters have 
come to our attention that cause us to believe that the disclosures 
marked with the symbol 
 in the Company’s sustainability report 
for the period from 1 January to31 December 2023 have not been 
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Report-
ing Criteria. We do not, however, provide a separate conclusion on 
each marked disclosure.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are 
less in extent than for a reasonable as-surance engagement; con-
sequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance 
engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would 
have been obtained had a reasonable assurance en-gagement 
been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the 
independent practitioner’s pro-fessional judgement.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, which we mostly 
performed between October 2023 and March 2024, we per-
formed, among other things, the following assurance procedures 
and other activities:

Gaining an understanding of the structure of the Group’s sus-
tainability organisation and stakeholder img engagement,

Inquiries of relevant personnel involved in the preparation pro-
cess about the preparation process, about the internal control 
relating to this process and about disclosures in the sustaina-
bility report, 

Identification of likely risks of material misstatements in the 
sustainability report,

Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the sustainabil-
ity report,

Examination of processes for collecting, controlling, analysing 
and aggregating selected data from different locations of the 
Company on a sample basis,

Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding 
data in the consolidated financial statements and combined 
management report,

Evaluation of the presentation of the sustainability report.

Practitioner’s Conclusion
Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the disclo-
sures marked with the symbol 
 in the Company’s sustainability 
report for the period from 1 January to31 December 2023 have 
not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
relevant Reporting Criteria.
Restriction of Use
We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed 
with the Company (including the “General Engagement Terms for 
Wirtschaftsprüfer and Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften (Ger-
man Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms)” dated1 January 
2017 promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)). 
We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was 
conducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report is 
intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the 
assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for 
any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the 
report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (finan-
cial) decisions based on it. 
Our responsibility is to the Company alone. We assume no respon-
sibility with regard to any third parties. Our conclusion is not modi-
fied in this respect.

Independent assurance report non-financial statement
Limited and reasonable assurance report of the independent 
practitioner regarding the combined non-financial statement for 
the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023
To Deutsche Telekom AG, Bonn/Germany
Engagement
We have performed a limited and reasonable assurance engage-
ment on the consolidated non-financial statement of Deutsche 
Telekom AG, Bonn/Germany, (hereafter referred to as “the Com-
pany”), which has been combined with the non-financial state-
ment of the Company, and which is contained in the combined 
management report of the parent and the group, for the financial 
year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 (hereafter referred to 
as “combined non-financial statement”). As requested, we have 
performed a reasonable assurance engagement on the indicators 
“energy consumption” and “CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)” pre-
sented in the combined non-financial statement (hereafter 
referred to as the “indicators”) and a limited assurance engage-
ment on all other disclosures contained in the combined non-
financial statement.
Our engagement does not cover the external sources of documen-
tation and expert opinions stated in the combined non-financial 
statement nor the references to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals img (SDG) marked with the SDG symbol.
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors
The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the 
preparation of the combined non-financial statement in accord-
ance with Sections 289c to 289e German Commercial Code 
(HGB), Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and 
Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament 
and the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a frame-
work to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regula-
tion (EU) 2019/2088 (hereafter referred to as “EU Taxonomy img 
Regulation”) and the delegated acts adopted thereunder, as well 
as with the interpretation of the wording and terminology con-
tained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts 
adopted thereunder by the executive directors, as is presented in 
section “Compliance with the EU taxonomy transparency require-
ments” of the combined non-financial statement (hereafter 
referred to as “interpretation”).
These responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company 
include the selection and application of appropriate methods 
regarding the combined non-financial statement and the use of 
assumptions and estimates for individual non-financial disclosures 
of the Group which are reasonable under the given circumstances. 
In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such inter-
nal control as they have determined necessary to enable the prep-
aration of a combined non-financial statement that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent com-
bined non-financial statement) or error.
About this report

210
Some of the wording and terminology contained in the EU Taxon-
omy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereunder are 
still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainty and have 
not yet been officially clarified. Therefore, the executive directors 
have laid down their own interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regu-
lation and of the delegated acts adopted thereunder in the section 
“Compliance with the EU taxonomy transparency requirements” of 
the combined non-financial statement. They are responsible for 
the reasonableness of this interpretation. As there is the immanent 
risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpreta-
tions, the legal conformity of the interpretation is prone to uncer-
tainty.
The preciseness and completeness of environmental data of the 
combined non-financial statement, which include the indicators, is 
subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the way in which the 
data was collected and calculated and from the assumptions 
made.
Independence and Quality Assurance of the Audit img Firm
We have fulfilled the requirements of German professional law on 
independence and further professional rules of conduct.
Our firm applies the national statutory rules and professional 
announcements – particularly of the “Professional Charter for Ger-
man Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors” (BS WP/vBP) 
and of the Quality Management Standards promulgated by the 
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW), and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive quality management system that includes docu-
mented policies and procedures with regard to compliance with 
professional ethical requirements, professional standards as well 
as relevant statutory and other legal requirements.
Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner
Our responsibility in each case is to express a conclusion on the 
indicators “energy consumption” and “CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 
2)” presented in the combined non-financial statement based on 
our work performed within our reasonable assurance engagement 
as well as to express a conclusion on all other disclosures con-
tained in the combined non-financial statement based on our work 
performed within our limited assurance engagement.
We conducted our work in accordance with the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Histori-
cal Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This standard 
requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so 
that we
	
obtain reasonable assurance to conclude whether the indica-
tors presented in the combined non-financial statement for the 
period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 have been stated 
by the executive directors, in all material respects, in accord-
ance with Sections 289c to 289e, Sections 315c in conjunction 
with 289c to 289e HGB; we do not, however, provide a sepa-
rate conclusion for each indicator; and
	
obtain limited assurance to conclude whether matters have 
come to our attention to cause us to believe that all other dis-
closures contained in the combined non-financial statement, 
with the exception of the external sources of documentation 
and expert opinions stated therein and the references to the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) marked 
with the SDG symbol, have not been prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Sec-
tions 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB, and the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereun-
der, as well as the interpretation by the executive directors dis-
closed in the section “Compliance with the EU taxonomy trans-
parency requirements” of the combined non-financial state-
ment.
The procedures performed in that part of our engagement to 
obtain limited assurance are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance 
obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 
than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasona-
ble assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assur-
ance work is subject to the practitioner’s professional judgement.
Within the scope of our assurance engagement, which we mostly 
performed between October 2023 and February 2024, we per-
formed, among others, the following assurance procedures and 
other work:
	
Gaining an understanding of the structure of the Group’s sus-
tainability organisation and stakeholders img engagement,
	
Inquiries of relevant employees involved in the preparation of 
the combined non-financial statement about the preparation 
process, about the internal control relating to this process and 
about disclosures in the combined non-financial statement,
	
Identification of potential risks of material misstatement in the 
combined non-financial statement,
	
Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the combined 
non-financial statement,
	
Comparison of selected disclosures with corresponding data in 
the consolidated and annual financial statements and the com-
bined management report,
	
Evaluation of the presentation of the combined non-financial 
statement,
	
Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible and tax-
onomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding dis-
closures in the combined non-financial statement.
About this report

211
In addition to the above, we performed the following procedures 
and other work within the scope of that part of our assurance 
engagement performed to obtain reasonable assurance regarding 
the indicators presented in the combined non-financial statement 
of the Company:
	
Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems 
and processes for determining, processing and monitoring the 
disclosures relating to the indicators,
	
Risk evaluation,
	
Tests of details on a sample basis.
In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to 
interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal 
conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance 
engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties. This uncertainty, 
in particular, also affects the quantification of performance indica-
tors in measuring and/or evaluating these performance indicators.
Practitioner’s Conclusions
We conclude that the indicators “energy consumption” and “CO2 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2)” presented in the combined non-finan-
cial statement for the period from 1 January to 31 December 
2023 have been stated by the executive directors, in all material 
respects, in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e, Sections 
315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB.
Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing 
has come to our attention that causes us to believe that all other 
disclosures in the combined non-financial statement for the finan-
cial year from 1 January to31 December 2023 have not been pre-
pared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sections 
289c to 289e HGB, Sections 315c in conjunction with 289c to 
289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated 
acts adopted thereunder, as well as with the interpretation by the 
executive directors presented in section “Compliance with the EU 
taxonomy transparency requirements” of the combined non-finan-
cial statement.
We do not express a conclusion on the external sources of docu-
mentation or expert opinions stated in the combined non-financial 
statement nor on the references to the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) marked with the SDG symbol.
Restriction of Use
We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed 
with the Company (including the “General Engagement Terms for 
Wirtschaftsprüfer and Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften (Ger-
man Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms)” as of 1 January 2017 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)). We draw 
attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was con-
ducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report is intended 
solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance 
engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other 
purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not 
intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) deci-
sions based on it.
We are liable solely to the Company. We assume no responsibility 
with regard to any third parties. Our conclusion was not modified 
in this respect.
