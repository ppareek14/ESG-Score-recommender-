This presentation contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding Dominion Energy. The statements relate to, among other things, expectations, 
estimates and projections concerning the business and operations of Dominion Energy. We have used the words “path”, "anticipate", "believe", "could", "estimate", "expect", "intend", "may", "plan", “outlook”, "predict", "project", 
“should”, “strategy”, “target”, "will“, “potential” and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this presentation. Such forward-looking statements, including operating earnings per share information and 
guidance, projected dividends, projected debt and equity issuances, projected cash flow, capital expenditures, operating expenses and debt information, shareholder return, and long-term growth or value, are subject to various risks 
and uncertainties. As outlined in our SEC filings, factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to: the direct and indirect impacts of implementing recommendations from the business review concluded in 
March 2024; unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; extreme weather events and other natural disasters; extraordinary external events, such as the pandemic health 
event resulting from COVID-19; federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments; changes to regulated rates collected by Dominion Energy; risks associated with entities in which Dominion Energy shares ownership with 
third parties, such as a 50% noncontrolling interest in the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) Commercial Project, including risks that result from lack of sole decision making authority, disputes that may arise between Dominion 
Energy and third party participants and difficulties in exiting these arrangements; timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction or expansion projects and compliance with conditions associated with 
such regulatory approvals; the inability to complete planned construction projects within time frames initially anticipated; risks and uncertainties that may impact the ability to construct the CVOW Commercial Project within the 
currently proposed timeline, or at all, and consistent with current cost estimates along with the ability to recover such costs from customers; risks and uncertainties associated with the timely receipt of future capital contributions, 
including optional capital contributions, if any, from the noncontrolling financing partner associated with the construction of the CVOW Commercial Project; changes to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, 
including those related to climate change; cost of environmental strategy and compliance, including cost related to climate change; changes in implementation and enforcement practices of regulators relating to environmental 
standards and litigation exposure for remedial activities; changes in operating, maintenance and construction costs; the availability of nuclear fuel, natural gas, purchased power or other materials utilized by Dominion Energy to 
provide electric generation, transmission and distribution and/or gas distribution services; additional competition in Dominion Energy’s industries; changes in demand for Dominion Energy’s services; risks and uncertainties associated 
with increased energy demand or significant accelerated growth in demand due to new data centers, including the concentration of data centers primarily in Loudoun County, Virginia and the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, 
environmental and other permits to construct new facilities in a timely manner; the technological and economic feasibility of large-scale battery storage, carbon capture and storage, small modular reactors, hydrogen and/or other 
clean energy technologies; receipt of approvals for, and timing of, closing dates for acquisitions and divestitures; impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, transfers of assets by Dominion Energy to joint ventures, and retirements of assets 
based on asset portfolio reviews; adverse outcomes in litigation matters or regulatory proceedings; fluctuations in interest rates; the effectiveness to which existing economic hedging instruments mitigate fluctuations in currency 
exchange rates of the Euro and Danish Krone associated with certain fixed price contracts for the major offshore construction and equipment components of the CVOW Commercial Project; changes in rating agency requirements or 
credit ratings and their effect on availability and cost of capital; and capital market conditions, including the availability of credit and the ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time 
in Dominion Energy’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The information in this presentation was prepared as of November 4, 2024. Dominion Energy undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking information statement to reflect developments after the statement is made. 
Projections or forecasts shown in this document are based on the assumptions listed in this document and are subject to change at any time.
This presentation shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities. Any offers to sell or solicitations of offers to buy securities will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended. This presentation has been prepared primarily for security analysts and investors in the hope that it will serve as a convenient and useful reference document. The format of this document may change in the future as 
we continue to try to meet the needs of security analysts and investors. This document is not intended for use in connection with any sale, offer to sell or solicitation of any offer to buy securities. This presentation includes certain 
financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In providing projections, estimates or guidance of operating earnings per share guidance (non-GAAP) and FFO to 
debt (non-GAAP), the company notes that there could be differences between such non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP equivalents of reported net income per share and reported net cash provided by operating activities to 
reported long-term debt, short-term debt, supplement credit facility borrowings and securities due within one year, respectively. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents are not provided, because the 
company cannot, without unreasonable effort, estimate or predict with certainty various components of net income, net cash provided by operating activities, long-term debt, short-term debt, supplemental credit facility borrowings or 
securities due within one year.

Responding to shareholder feedback: recent updates to executive compensation 
9
▪Since 2023, 100% of CEO Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) is performance based
▪For 2023, 94% of CEO LTIP payout was based on TSR, with a 65th percentile target payout
▪For 2024, 65% of CEO LTIP payout is based on TSR, with a 65th percentile target payout
▪Eliminated opportunity for CEO to earn a portion of LTIP payout based on relative P/E ratio
▪At CEO’s request, the CTD Committee exercised negative discretion for his 2021 performance 
grant payout, lowering payout to $0, despite goal achievement of 51.2%

▪For 2024, cash performance grant for officers replaced with performance share units, to 
further align compensation with shareholder outcomes
▪For 2024, LTIP grant for officers attributable to restricted stock has been reduced from 40% to 
30%, with 70% attributable to the new PSU grant
▪Our CEO received a performance share award in lieu of the restricted stock portion of his 2024 
LTIP
▪The ability to earn any payout based on our relative P/E ratio modifier was eliminated from the 
CEO’s 2023 LTIP and has been eliminated for all officers starting with the 2024 LTIP

All employees share four common goal categories and 
funding level is based on consolidated operating EPS
▪We believe that continuing to focus incentive goals on 
our business strategy will result in higher long-term 
returns (including stock price performance) for 
shareholders
▪Thus, higher than sector average officer stock 
ownership requirements create alignment between 
management financial interests and successful 
execution of our business strategy
▪Require significant stock ownership, including 6x base 
salary for our CEO, 4x base salary for our Executive 
Vice Presidents and 3x base salary for our other

Continued reduction in Scope 1 carbon emissions from 
power generation in 2023 was driven by an increase in 
renewable generation and a decrease in coal-fired 
generation:
▪
Added 200 MW of solar to the system in 2023
▪
~12,000 MW of renewable generation in service or 
in development as of early 2024
▪
With expected completion in 2026, the Coastal 
Virginia Offshore Wind commercial project’s 176 
turbines will have a capacity of up to 2,600 MW

Recent updates
▪
October 2024: Dominion Energy Virginia filed its 2024 Integrated Resource Plan  
― The need for additional in-state resources to generate, transmit, and distribute power reliably is acute — 
demand is forecasted to increase 5.5% annually over the next decade and double by 2039 in Dominion Energy’s 
delivery zone within PJM
― Nearly 80% of the plan’s incremental power generation over the next 15 years is carbon-free
― About 20% of the plan’s incremental power generation will come from natural gas to facilitate the transition to 
clean energy by reliably generating power when customers need it the most 
▪
March 2024: Dominion Energy South Carolina filed its 2024 Integrated Resource Plan
― Evaluated 12 build plans, each of which expand solar and battery resources, while adding the generation 
resources needed to ensure reliability
▪
Note: IRPs are not a request to build any specific project, but rather long-term planning documents based on a
