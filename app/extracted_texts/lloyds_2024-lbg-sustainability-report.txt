Group Chief Executive’s statement
Group 
Chief Executive’s  
statement
With over 28 million UK customers, we can help to 
create a more sustainable and inclusive future for the 
people and businesses we serve. In 2024, we continued 
to focus on making the biggest impact we could for the UK 
in the interest of all our stakeholders. I’m pleased to share 
our progress. 
Improving access to housing 
We are deeply involved in the UK’s housing sector, and 
we want to help the UK access good-quality and genuinely 
affordable housing. As the UK’s largest mortgage lender, we 
helped more customers onto the housing ladder last year 
by providing £15 billion to first-time buyers, delivering 
growth in line with our strategy. In addition to making 
finance available, we continue to support customers to 
retrofit their homes through our Green Living Reward and 
renewed Effective Homes partnership, to offer customers 
quality and affordable insulation. We continue to champion 
the UK’s social housing sector and alongside our charity 
partner, Crisis, we have called for one million more homes 
at social rent by the end of the decade. Since 2018, we 
have supported £19.5 billion of funding to the sector, 
delivering £2.2 billion in 2024 and growing our Commercial 
Banking business, while supporting our purpose objectives.
Beyond our focus on new homes, we are working with 
partners across the industry to improve the UK’s existing 
housing stock. Last year, we announced the National 
Wealth Fund Partnership – a £500 million fund to help 
Our 2024 sustainability report showcases how we are 
delivering on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, by 
unlocking sustainable and inclusive growth for our customers, 
colleagues and communities. By delivering on our sustainability 
objectives and focussing on our customers, we’re accessing 
new commercial growth opportunities, providing positive 
outcomes for stakeholders and building a more resilient and 
profitable business that delivers higher, sustainable returns.

Investing in our regions
Last year, we continued to support regional development 
and thriving communities. In 2024, we became the first major 
UK bank to lend to a Community Development Financial 
Institution (CDFI), contributing £43 million to three CDFIs 
as part of a £62 million fund. This investment is designed 
to support 800 businesses and up to 10,500 regional jobs. 
This transaction was facilitated by our Regional Impact 
Fund, committing £1 billion to regenerating housing and 
communities, creating economic opportunities in regions 
and supporting the transition to net zero across the UK. 
Building a diverse business to serve 
customers and communities
Beyond supporting the development of UK regions, we 
need to make sure our own business understands and 
reflects the communities we serve. To that end, we have 
continued to develop our approach to diversity and now 
aim for a gender balance of 45 to 55 per cent in all 
executive roles by the end of 2030. 
We have also updated our ethnic diversity targets, aiming 
for 3.5 to 4 per cent of Black heritage and 19 to 22 per cent 
of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic colleagues in executive 
roles by end of 2030, increasing our ambition for senior 
colleagues. We believe that a diverse and inclusive 
workforce also allows us to retain and attract the 
best talent which is essential for delivering our ongoing 
strategic transformation.
Building resilience by supporting the 
net zero transition
We have further embedded our environmental strategy 
and Climate Action Plan across the Group this year. 
We continue to support the UK’s transition to net zero 
by advancing initiatives that decarbonise our economy 
and protect nature. Last year, we deployed significant 
lending and investment aligned to our core business areas. 
In 2024, we achieved our financing targets for EPC A and B 
mortgage lending and financing for electric vehicles and 
plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
We made our first investment in nature protection, 
becoming a founding business partner of Projects for 
Nature, supporting three landmark nature recovery 
projects in England. Through our banking business, 
we have now provided over £47 billion of sustainable 
finance since 2022. In Scottish Widows, we achieved 
our cumulative investment target of £25 billion 
in climate-aware strategies one year early, with 
£25.9 billion invested by the end of 2024. Looking 
ahead, we’ve set new financing targets of £11 billion 
for EPC A and B mortgages and £10 billion for electric 
vehicles by the end of 2027. We start 2025 in a strong 
position with emissions calculated for 96 per cent 
of our bank lending and we continue to support our 
clients with their net zero transitions. 
We strengthened our approach to Credible Transition 
Plans in 2024, expanding the number of clients 
we assess, with £14 billion of our Commercial and 
Institutional Banking book now covered by Transition 
Plan Assessments, a significant increase from the 
£2.9 billion assessed last year. Supporting the net 
zero transition is driving growth across our business 
and will help secure the long-term resilience of our 
customers, communities and financial sector. 
Delivering growth and opportunity in 2025
As we look forward to the rest of 2025, we will continue 
to unlock sustainable and inclusive growth in line with 
our strategy and deliver on our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper. 
Charlie Nunn
Group Chief Executive
bolster retrofitting of social homes in the UK. 
This blended finance model will enable housing 
associations to improve energy efficiency and bring down 
costs for residents – improving health, work and home 
lives. Going forward, we will continue our work across the 
housing sector to increase the provision of safe, sustainable 
and affordable homes, in line with our strategy to unlock 
sustainable and inclusive growth.
Empowering our customers
From day-to-day spending to saving for the long term, 
we want to empower our customers to make confident 
decisions that add up to a more prosperous future. 
As the UK’s biggest digital bank, we are putting more 
power in the hands of our customers to help them secure 
their financial wellbeing. Launched last year, our Ready-
Made Investments offer investments picked and managed 
by our expert teams to help empower our customers to 
start investing. Our Ready-Made Pensions are also helping 
customers grasp their retirement planning by allowing them 
to view, track and top up their pensions via our mobile app 
for the first time. By offering our customers these new and 
easy to use digital products, we are growing the Group’s 
assets under administration. 
Elsewhere in the business, we launched our new Bill 
Switcher and Benefit Calculator tools to help customers 
with their everyday spending. Since launching in October, 
over 1 million customers have interacted with the Benefit 
Calculator and over 300,000 have accessed Bill Switcher 
to check potential savings. Over the last 12 months, 
2.4 million customers took advantage of our in-app 
Credit Score tool, with over 780,000 actively improving 
their credit health. Tools like these help us better serve 
our customers and support the growth we delivered 
in 2024. We also continued our work to empower 
a diverse range of UK businesses last year, providing over 
32,000 hours of targeted support for under-represented 
entrepreneurs. It’s been an important year of progress, 
and we will continue to use our unparalleled data and 
insight to empower our customers to improve their 
financial wellbeing.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Our Group strategy continued
Creating a sustainable and inclusive future is core to our business 
growth and purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Guided by our 
Group strategy, we are concentrating on areas where we can 
have the biggest impact, delivering our purpose while creating 
value for all our stakeholders.
We have identified purpose pillars that underpin how we are 
Helping Britain Prosper and support the delivery of our Group’s 
strategy. These pillars represent areas where we believe we can 
deliver significant societal impact at scale for the UK, leveraging 
our core capabilities as an integrated financial services provider. 
They are built on the foundation of ongoing business activity 
and to embed sustainability in all that we do while acting in 
a trusted and responsible manner through risk management, 
conduct and governance.
By delivering on our objectives across the pillars, we can create 
further commercial growth opportunities as well as positive 
outcomes for our stakeholders and thus build a more resilient 
and profitable business to deliver higher, more sustainable 
returns for our shareholders.
Our purpose pillars enable us to consider and embed activities 
to support a just transition for the UK. A just transition means 
‘greening the economy in a way that is fair and inclusive to everyone 
concerned, creating decent work opportunities and leaving no 
one behind’1. We continue working to identify ways we can support 
the transition to net zero whilst retaining our focus on key social 
objectives such as skills, affordability, education and regeneration 
across sectors, regions and the range of our customers.

Our Group strategy
Overview
The Group has continued to engage with our 
stakeholders to determine the sustainability topics 
which are important to them. 
In 2024 we refreshed our material topics list through 
a review of both our external and internal 
environments, which included our value chain, 
markets in which we operate, products, services 
and activities, as well as through horizon scanning, 
reviews of reporting frameworks and stakeholder 
engagement. Our internal environment includes 
colleagues, processes and policies, culture and 
management. We have used the outputs from this 
exercise to refresh our materiality assessment.
Our Group strategy continued
Value chain and materiality
At the heart of our purpose is a desire 
to create value for all our stakeholders 
by understanding what matters to 
them. Engaging with and listening 
to our stakeholders is intrinsic 
to our business acting in a trusted 
and responsible manner.
Our role as a UK-based financial institution is to 
facilitate the flow of funds between participants in the 
UK economy, act as custodians of financial assets and 
protect value for our customers, all while considering 
long-term trends and their impact on what we do and 
the value we create for the society and communities we 
operate in. As such, the way we manage sustainability 
issues matters and our performance is integral in
how we shape finance as a force for good.
In 2024, we continued to explore and evolve our 
approach to double materiality, leveraging existing 
materiality processes and tools with the aim of 
embedding a double materiality1 assessment.
The Group continues to consider the regulatory 
landscape and is preparing for readiness to report in 
alignment with the UK government adoption of the 
International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and 
the implementation of the EU’s Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD) reporting for selected EU 
entities from 2025, with the remainder of the Group 
falling into scope for CSRD reporting from 2028.
Further details on our Group Value chain can be 
found within our annual report and accounts here

As defined within the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. 
When conducting our materiality review and impact 
assessment of our operations, products and services in 
line with the requirements of the United Nations Environment 
Programme for Financial Institutions Principles for Responsible 
Banking (UNEP FI PRB), we have considered, among other 
frameworks, the UN Sustainability Development Goals 
(SDGs) which provide a common framework for us to show 
how we use our operating model, scale and resources to 
respond to some of the UK’s biggest societal challenges.
We prioritise our material topics based on:
1.	 The strategic importance of the issue to the Group
2.	 The importance of the issue to our stakeholders
3.	 The social, economic and environmental impact 
of each topic in relation to the core activities, 
products and services provided by the Group

Our ongoing participation in global

World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD)
The WBCSD is a global organisation of over 200 businesses 
working to achieve the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals through the transformation of economic systems. 
The Group joined the Council in summer 2023 and as a full 
member has been participating in several projects aligned 
to our systems thinking, including the Agriculture and Food 
Pathway and Nature Action in order to support our 
sustainability ambitions. 
United Nations Environment Programme 
for Financial Institutions – Principles for 
Responsible Banking
The Group became a member of the UNEP FI PRB 
in 2019 to support the banking industry accelerate 
its contribution to achieving society’s goals as expressed 
in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris 
Agreement. During 2024, we have participated in the 
review of the principles framework.
Equator Principles
Lloyds Banking Group is a signatory to the Equator 
Principles, which is a risk management framework for 
determining, assessing and managing environmental 
and social risk in project finance transactions, such as 
large-scale energy, industrial or infrastructure projects. 
We continue to support the association by participating 
in ongoing working groups considering the scope and 
nature of the principles. 
For details on environmental sustainability specific 
partnerships see pages 78, 119 to 120 and 124.
Our frameworks
We have a number of frameworks in 
place across the Bank and Scottish 
Widows that support the delivery of our 
strategy. These frameworks provide the 
detail on how we consider sustainability 
in our banking products and services, 
investments and stewardship activities. 
Sustainable Financing Framework 
The Sustainable Financing Framework, launched in 2023, has 
been designed to set out our methodology for classifying 
whether certain financial products and services offered by 
Lloyds Banking Group may be described as sustainable for 
the purpose of tracking and disclosing the Group’s progress 
against its sustainable financing targets. 
The Framework is used as the basis to support the 
reporting and assurance of the Group’s progress against 
its sustainable financing targets and will be used when 
developing sustainable finance products. It also promotes 
new environmental and social financing opportunities. 
The structured and consistent framework enhances the 
Group’s risk management and reporting, which can 
encourage innovation in financing and the development 
of new financial products and services that align with 
the Group’s sustainability objectives and ambitions.
The framework covers the Group’s Consumer lending, 
Business and Commercial Banking and Corporate and 
Institutional Banking eligible products. It sits alongside 
the Group’s Sustainable Bond Framework and was updated 
during 2024 to incorporate the Group’s Housebuilding 
Sustainability Finance Framework.
For further information refer to the Sustainable Financing 
Framework here 
Sustainable Bond Framework
The Group’s Sustainable Bond Framework facilitates the 
issuance of use of proceeds green and social bonds of any 
seniority within the capital structure by Lloyds Banking 
Group or any of its subsidiaries. It covers five categories 
of lending: green buildings, renewable energy, energy 
efficiency, clean transportation and affordable housing; 
setting out the methodology for classifying whether 
products may be described as sustainable, supporting 
the funding of eligible assets and the Group’s sustainability 
strategy. The updated framework was published in April 
2024. The Group has issued two green bonds under the 
framework to date.
For further information refer to the Sustainable Bond 
Framework here 
External Sector Statements
As a Group, managing risk effectively is fundamental 
to our strategy and future success. As discussed further 
in our Risk Management section (page 127), our ESG risk 
appetite related to our direct lending activity is outlined 
in our External Sector Statements available in our 
sustainability downloads stating our requirements 
and expectations for lending to high-risk sectors.

Responsible Investment Framework
At Scottish Widows, responsible investment (RI) is fitted as 
standard to help us deliver good outcomes for our customers. 
We look after the retirement savings of millions of hard-
working people who expect us to exercise our judgement 
on the most appropriate way of investing over the long term. 
Our approach seeks to develop resilient investment portfolios 
which offer both downside protection and upside potential, 
while shaping a better world to retire into.
It is underpinned by the 1987 United Nations definition of 
sustainability: ‘Meeting the needs of the present, without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their 
own needs.’ This is fully aligned with our focus on what 
matters to our customers today and tomorrow.
To bring to life how we do this, our Responsible Investment 
Framework sets out the principles which guide our approach, 
from asset allocation to manager selection, fund research and 
engagement activity. We are signatories to the UN’s Principles 
for Responsible Investment 
 which have also steered the 
evolution of our framework. 
Our responsible investment strategy is underpinned 
by our stewardship policy, including ensuring alignment 
with the FRC’s Stewardship Code and our exclusions 
policy and is approved by the Board of Scottish Widows.
Our stewardship policy applies to all Scottish Widows 
investments, other than direct loans in our shareholder 
funds, where Lloyds Banking Group External Sector 
Statements are applied. These loans represent a small 
proportion of our investments. 
We believe stewardship is integral to our business and 
investment philosophy. As a large UK asset owner, we want 
to ensure we play our part, not only in the responsible 
oversight of our own assets, but in driving industry-wide 
transition for better long-term outcomes for our customers 
and clients, benefitting the UK and global economy 
as a whole.
Our Responsible Investment (RI) Framework
01
We seek to integrate RI across public 
and private asset classes, applying our 
exclusions and stewardship policy as 
foundations. We deliver this through 
our asset managers and increase our 
impact through private markets.
02
We are active owners and engage 
with corporates to set expectations 
and support their transition. We use 
our shareholder rights and vote to 
influence company direction, 
escalating where necessary.
05
We focus on shaping real world 
outcomes, driving best practice 
and addressing system-wide issues, 
strengthening our influence through 
industry collaboration.
06
Our net zero carbon emissions 2050 
ambition is focused on a just, low 
carbon transition that is inclusive and 
connects climate, nature and social 
considerations.
03
Our approach is driven by research 
into the risks and opportunities of 
sustainability themes and supported by 
data analysis. This provides rigour and 
strengthens the decisions we make to 
deliver better outcomes for customers.
04
We aim to offer an industry-leading 
fund range to our wide range of 
customers and offer choice to meet 
different customer objectives. We seek 
to do this by providing fund options 
that align with their values while 
growing their savings for the future.

obligations.
We target our stewardship initiatives across three 
core pillars:
•	 Monitoring and oversight of our appointed 
investment managers
•	 Direct and collective engagement with material 
investee companies
•	 Contributing to industry-wide initiatives like those 
related to policy advocacy 
We aim to underpin this activity through dialogue

Overview
Access to quality and affordable housing
Supporting 
the UK housing 
market
Access to housing is one of the core conditions in the 
creation of a sustainable and inclusive society – providing 
financial and household security whilst supporting healthy 
lives, strong communities and economic productivity.
Through our reach, expertise and the banking and insurance 
products and services we provide, we touch every part 
of the UK housing ecosystem – from housebuilding through 
to housing associations, private landlords to renters and 
homeowners. Our approach is core to our Group strategy 
and supports the delivery of inclusive and sustainability 
growth opportunities in both our Retail and Commercial 
Banking businesses.
We are uniquely placed to drive change and as access 
to secure and quality housing is becoming increasingly 
challenging for a large number of people, we want to 
explore the opportunities to increase access to the benefits 
of home ownership. This includes not only through mortgages 
but also through shared ownership alongside supporting 
a quality rental and social housing sector that encourages 
inclusive communities, and increasing the availability 
of specialist housing. 
Our efforts in the sector were 
recognised through the Property 
Week RESI Award for Large Financier 
of the Year and Real Estate Capital’s 
award for Sustainable Finance 
Provider of the Year: Europe.
Broadening 
access to home 
ownership
Supporting our mortgage customers
As the UK’s largest mortgage lender, we are supporting 
more and more people to buy their first home. We have 
provided over £15.1 billion of funding to first-time buyers 
in 2024. 
We have made available £2 billion of lending to first-time 
buyers borrowing more than 4.5 times their income and our 
‘First-time Buyer Boost’ proposition allows eligible customers 
with a deposit of at least 10 per cent to borrow up to 5.5 
times their income. This has ‘boosted’ the amount they 
can borrow to buy their first home by up to 22 per cent.
Through our family of brands, we provide buyer events to 
support customers on their home buying journey. We also 
enable customers to set a deposit savings goal and track 
their progress on this towards their home buying aspiration. 
Our customers have also utilised the ‘Your Credit Score’ 
tool to help understand and take control of their credit 
health. Please refer to page 26 for more information on 
Your Credit Score.
Product support for customers with smaller deposits 
include intergenerational options such as our ‘Lend a Hand’ 
mortgage from Lloyds Bank. This allows a family member 
to put down 10 per cent of the purchase price of a home 
into a fixed term savings account, in place of a deposit.
The Group is also a major participating lender in the 
Government’s Mortgage Guarantee Scheme which 
supports the provision of mortgages to customers with 
a deposit of 5 per cent to 10 per cent. We will remain 
committed to supporting customers with lower 
deposits realise their home ownership aspirations. 
Making the home ownership journey easier
In 2024, the Group invested £3 million in Coadjute, 
an innovative proptech designed to connect all parties 
involved in the home ownership journey. Coadjute’s 
platform is being designed to simplify the house buying 
process for all involved parties by connecting existing 
property software systems across the house buying journey. 
It will enable related parties to share communications and 
documents quickly and securely, increasing transparency 
and speed across each step of the property buying journey 
from estate agents to brokers, banks and conveyancers. 
Recently, Group research has shown 30 per cent of those 
looking to step into home ownership for the first time 
admitted that they do not understand the process of 
buying a property, with 51 per cent only somewhat 
understanding it. Over time, Coadjute’s solution could 
make it easier and cheaper to buy a home, helping both 
first-time buyers get onto the housing ladder and those 
wanting to move home.
The Group led the investment, alongside industry partners 
across the housing sector. As the lead investor, the Group 
will support Coadjute in its ambition to help the housing 
industry simplify some of its most complex pinch points 
and speed up the home buying journey.
Supporting the UK housing market 
is core to our Group strategy.

Shared ownership
Shared ownership offers a potential pathway into 
home ownership for those initially unable to access full 
ownership. We are a founding member of the Shared 
Ownership Council, which aims to grow this market and 
provide enhanced support for these customers. We have 
reduced the minimum share a customer needs to purchase 
a new build home from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. 
In 2023, we launched ‘Pathways’ through Lloyds Living, 
which provides renters the ability to buy their home 
through shared ownership. From our initial pilot, 10 per 
cent of customers have now acquired the first share in their 
home, with tranches between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. 
The Pathways scheme is benefitting a range of customers 
– from first-time buyers and people relocating to split 
families and downsizers – and we are now expanding 
the pilot and looking to scale the pipeline for 2025. 
Our Pathways scheme is helping more people get a foot 
on the property ladder, giving customers the opportunity 
to buy their rented property through shared ownership. 
This is bringing down the affordability barrier experienced 
by many in trying to obtain a mortgage for the full value of 
a property, for example through reduced deposit amounts 
of 5 per cent and is providing customers with greater 
security in their homes.
For further information on Lloyds Living please refer 
to page 17.
We have also commenced a pilot with The Housing 
Network where we are working with local authorities 
to house families living in temporary accommodation. 
Chaudhry and Khaula were ready 
to put down roots and settle into 
a home that suited their growing 
family. With two children, they longed 
for a change in scenery and were 
drawn to Chesterfield with its 
welcoming community and closer 
proximity to family.
The couple explored their housing 
options and decided that the Lloyds 
Living Pathways shared ownership 
scheme was the perfect choice for 
them. With Chaudhry relying on 
a modest self-employed income, they 
wanted a solution that gave them the 
flexibility they needed and allowed 
them to invest in their future rather 
than rent. 
“We had lots of questions about 
shared ownership…Every question 
was answered, and every concern 
addressed. The customer service 
was exceptional in every way,” 
Khaula shared.
With an accessible deposit minimum 
of just five per cent of the share they 
were buying, the Pathways shared 
ownership scheme proved to be 
the perfect solution for the couple. 
Shared ownership allows buyers 
to purchase an initial share of 
a property, while paying rent on 
the portion they do not yet own. 
Over time, they have the option 
to gradually increase their ownership 
by purchasing additional shares, 
ultimately working towards owning 
their property outright.
“We got the dream home we 
wanted,” Khaula said, referring 
to the private four-bedroom house 
tucked away in a quiet corner of 
the development. “It’s the perfect 
fit for our family.”

Overview

Supporting the rental market
The Group is working to improve quality in the private 
rented sector. In 2022, we published research in collaboration 
with Social Finance exploring how lenders can improve 
the private rented sector. The report concluded that a 
National Landlord Register in England will have a significant 
impact on housing quality and conditions for renters, 
and emphasised there is a golden opportunity to design 
the register in such a way so that mortgage providers 
can use it to inform lending decisions and influence 
landlord behaviour. 
We have continued to build consensus across the industry 
and with political stakeholders on the opportunity for 
mortgage providers to access and use the Private Rented 
Sector Database proposed in the Renters’ Rights Bill 
in England. This will ensure greater accountability for 
landlords in providing quality rental housing and a ‘one 
stop shop’ for relevant guidance on landlord obligations. 
For tenants it will increase transparency and the 
information available before they decide to rent 
a property and throughout their renting journey. 
Lloyds Living
Renamed from Citra Living in 2024, the rental and 
shared ownership provider of Lloyds Banking Group 
passed its third anniversary. We now operate a growing 
portfolio of more than 3,500 professionally managed 
homes, improving access to affordable, high-quality, 
energy efficient housing across the UK. 
Lloyds Living is working with leading housebuilders and 
developers through strategic partnerships to accelerate 
the delivery of housing, through homes for private rent. 
In 2024, we have diversified our development partners, 
enabling regional development and now work with small 
and medium enterprise (SME) developers, supporting 
their growth ambitions. In total, we now have 13 partners, 
each working across multiple sites. 
For further information on how Lloyds Living is supporting 
renters on the journey to ownership please refer to page 16.
Supporting landlords to be sustainable
Our BM Solutions1 business has teamed up with the Energy 
Saving Trust to help customers make energy efficiency 
improvements to their properties. This year we launched 
our Landlord Retrofit Tool which creates a personalised 
action plan for improving each rental property that’s 
tailored to a landlord’s budget. The tool suggests specific 
changes for a property, and links through to relevant 
government grants and energy company schemes to 
support with the cost of completing the measures. 
Our BM business development managers frequently 
educate brokers on private rented sector regulation 
and proposed standards relevant to landlords in the 
different nations of the UK. We also partnered with 
other professionals across the private rented sector 
this year to bring retrofit and regulatory expertise 
directly to landlord audiences.

Supporting small and

This year we partnered with Homes 
England and Barratt Redrow to 
launch a £150 million joint venture 
to oversee multiple large-scale 
projects, in response to the demand 
for new homes across the country.
This pioneering MADE partnership 
between the Group, Homes England 
and Barratt Redrow has created a 
master developer to accomplish largest-
scale residential projects, community 
regeneration and place-based design.
The first agreement was signed with 
Tameside Council to deliver its flagship 
project, Godley Green Garden Village in 
Greater Manchester. Once established, 
the partnership will be responsible 
for overseeing and managing the 
development of the garden village, 
as well as delivering an ambitious 
social value strategy and ensuring 
robust long-term stewardship 
is put in place. This type of 
cross-sector collaboration is 
needed to address the country’s 
chronic housing shortage, at 
significant ambition and scale.
The landmark new partnership 
announced today will support 
our commitment to ramp 
up housing supply and boost 
economic growth by 
developing more large-scale, 
attractive and sustainable 
places across the country 
with the homes, jobs

communities need to thrive.”

Overview
Increasing the supply of social 
and affordable housing
£2.2bn 
of new funding supported  
to the social housing sector 
in 2024
The Group has been championing 
social housing for decades. Since 
2018, we’ve supported £19.5 billion 
of funding to the sector. Social 
housing continues to be a source 
of lending growth, with improving 
returns year on year. 
We work with over 320 housing associations, from 
small local associations to larger organisations with 
tens of thousands of homes. We work right across 
the country, from Osprey Housing in the North East 
of Scotland down to VIVID headquartered in Portsmouth. 
Our experience in the sector is helping these clients 
meet the UK’s housing needs through various funding and 
expertise mechanisms. Through our pensions and long-term 
savings brand Scottish Widows, we are able to provide 
longer-term funding to the sector, as well as helping 
to support the provision of products such as annuities.
Social housing is an integral part of the UK’s housing 
landscape with millions of people benefitting from stable 
and genuinely affordable homes. We believe social housing 
should be considered a key piece of the national infrastructure 
alongside transport, energy and digital infrastructure – 
providing the basic foundations of thriving communities and 
a prosperous economy. Its absence exacerbates insecurity, 
inequality and poor societal outcomes. 
Our funding helps housing associations to invest in the 
quality of their housing stock, from building new homes to 
supporting retrofitting and energy efficiency improvements, 
helping to create warmer homes and lower energy bills.
In 2024, we supported £2.2 billion of new funding to the 
social housing sector of which £1.2 billion is sustainable1 
(green or social use of proceeds) or sustainability-linked1 
(including key ESG performance indicators). Funding to 
the social housing sector is included in the Commercial 
Banking £30 billion sustainable financing target due to 
its social use of proceeds. Social housing continues to be 
a source of lending growth, with returns improving year 
on year.
Refer to page 66 for more on our sustainable financing 
targets and progress.

Social Housing Initiative
In 2023, Charlie Nunn, Group Chief Executive, 
launched the Social Housing Initiative (SHI) to bring 
together a range of stakeholders to take steps 
in addressing the chronic lack of social housing 
and genuinely affordable homes in the UK. 
In 2024, through the SHI’s collaborative efforts, 
members are delivering on a number of pilot 
initiatives to reduce barriers to good homes, 
unlocking land and addressing immediate pressures 
on local authorities to house those in urgent need. 
In 2023, we reviewed our social housing lending policy 
so that, where applicable, associations can accelerate 
spending on tenant safety, damp and mould, retrofit 
and increasing the supply of new homes. Reflecting 
this, since 2023 we have migrated a range of clients 
who are benefitting from a combined year one increase 
in financial capacity of c.£800 million, a cumulative 
increase of c.£4 billion over a five-year period.

Building futures – a new era of 
investment in social housing
This year we published a new white paper, Building 
futures – a new era of investment in social housing, 
which proposes innovative new solutions to the 
challenges facing the social housing sector.
There is a need for a significant increase in investment 
in social rent housing in the country, and in the paper 
we set out our prospectus for action. It also included 
a package of measures that will help deliver more 
social homes, including proposals for two new 
investment mechanisms that could generate up 
to 200,000 new homes for social rent over 10 years 
and wider reforms for the social housing sector.

Commitment to small local housing 
associations 
In July 2024, we announced a new £200 million financing 
commitment to support local providers who provide 
housing for those who need it most. Specialist housing 
providers are small in number but deliver critical services 
for vulnerable people. Beneficiary groups include people 
at risk of homelessness and rough sleeping, and people 
suffering from complex mental health issues and learning 
disabilities or recovering from addiction. 
This financing arrangement is included in the Commercial 
Banking £30 billion sustainable financing target due to 
its social use of proceeds. 
Decarbonising our housing stock is critical 
for the transition to a low carbon economy, 
and there is urgent need for good-quality, 
greener homes which are warmer and more 
affordable to maintain. 
We have a significant role to play as one 
of the UK’s largest retail and commercial 
banks, and are proud to work in partnership 
with the National Wealth Fund to 
accelerate the retrofit of social housing. 
Through a blended finance solution, we are 
enabling housing associations to improve 
energy-efficiency and cost-effectiveness 
for residents – improving health, work and 
home lives. We’ll continue working across 
the housing sector to help increase the 
provision of safe, sustainable homes.”
Charlie Nunn
Group Chief Executive 
This is exactly the kind of investment we 
want to see to grow our economy, just days 
after the International Investment Summit 
that secured over £60 billion of investment 
into the UK. And this is only the start. 
With £27.8 billion in total, the National 
Wealth Fund will unlock tens of billions 
more in private investment, fuelling 
growth across the UK and making a real 
difference in people’s lives.”

Converting old sites into new social housing
To increase the supply of new social housing in the UK, the 
Group has announced intentions for the redevelopment of 
decommissioned Group data centres and former office sites 
into new social housing projects. The Group has plans to 
identify suitable housing partners in the regions who will 
be responsible for redeveloping the sites to increase the 
availability of social housing. The construction of the first site
in Pudsey, West Yorkshire, formerly an office and data centre, 
is set to commence in 2026. Subject to planning permission, 
the first redevelopment in Pudsey will create up to 80
new homes that could be available for social rent and help 
to increase the supply of good, affordable homes in the UK. 
This project will also be guided by our efforts in greening 
the built environment, please refer to page 95 for our 
strategy and progress.
National Wealth Fund Partnership
In 2024, Lloyds Bank and the National Wealth Fund (NWF) 
signed a £500 million funding commitment to support 
the retrofit of social housing in the UK. This marks the first 
investment since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that 
the UK Infrastructure Bank has transformed to become 
the NWF. Funding is flexible and competitively priced 
to support housing associations to meet their net zero 
ambitions. Improvements such as low carbon heating 
and insulation create warmer homes, lower bills and 
better life outcomes for residents. 
This deal showcases how innovative public and private 
expertise can come together to deploy private capital 
to deliver warmer, greener homes for social tenants.
This capital has already been deployed to support 
housing providers such as New Start, a family-run 
not-for-profit organisation that provide quality, 
supported housing and residential care services to 
vulnerable men, women and children. With our backing, 
New Start has helped hundreds of people experiencing 
homelessness across Merseyside.

couple of nights before I presented 
myself as homeless to Edinburgh City 
Council in 2021. Those nights were 
unbelievably challenging.”
John was placed into temporary 
accommodation whilst he received 
support from the council and a local 
homelessness charity, Turning Point.
“The stereotype of a person 
experiencing homelessness sat on the 
street doing nothing was the complete 
opposite to me: I spent all my time 
running around to appointments 
and meetings, doing everything I 
could to reboot my life and rebuild 
the momentum I had lost when I 
reached crisis point. It took every 
ounce of my energy to keep going.”
John’s time in temporary 
accommodation was challenging. 
“I asked to move from the 
accommodation in which I was staying 
as the atmosphere became really 
uncomfortable. The location was 
Crisis’ Changing Lives programme 
awards grants to people with lived 
experience of homelessness between 
£250 and £5,000 to progress education 
or employment, or to help set up their 
own business, alongside wrap-around 
support including mentoring, 
workshops and other development 
opportunities.
John was encouraged to apply for 
an initial grant to complete a Housing 
Rights Awareness course, enabling him 
to understand the legal and structural 
landscape of homelessness. 
“My confidence and health started 
to come back, and the trauma started 
to fade into the background. I realised 
I could turn everything around.
I had the opportunity to apply for a 
second Changing Lives grant to obtain 
a Housing Studies diploma run by the 
Chartered Institute of Housing and 
University of Stirling. I’m now learning 
remote and I had no money to travel 
into Edinburgh. I was able to move 
somewhere more central so I could 
access my appointments, but this 
accommodation was considerably 
worse – there was crime and people 
died whilst I was living there. I was 
then moved again with all the stress 
and upheaval.”
John’s experience of temporary 
accommodation significantly impacted 
his mental health. “I completed a 
counselling course to develop my skills, 
and it began to hit me just how wrong 
my life went. I became incredibly 
depressed and hopeless.” John’s 
temporary accommodation had 
a curfew which impacted his social 
support network. “I needed a huge 
stroke of luck for something to change. 
And that was when Crisis came in.”
“I was walking up Edinburgh’s Royal 
Mile when I saw Crisis’ logo which 
I remembered from being a teenager.” 
about the mechanisms of 
homelessness to pursue my dreams 
of working in homelessness and 
housing, and I’m soon to complete 
a related internship.”
When you’re facing 
homelessness, you feel 
invisible and not part of 
society. After two years of 
homelessness, Crisis gave 
me the recognition that I 
had worth and reminded 
me that society cares.”
At Lloyds Banking Group, we are 
proud to support the Changing Lives 
programme, with funding, strategic 
support and mentors. John is one of 
thousands of grant recipients since 
Changing Lives was launched in 
2022 and can now realise his goal of 
becoming a housing rights specialist.
John walked into Crisis and asked 
to speak to someone to help and 
was seen that week by Amanda, an 
Engagement and Assessment Worker. 
“Amanda helped me to regain my 
autonomy by moving me into self-
contained temporary accommodation. 
I had my own space. My family and 
friends could come and visit me for 
the first time in two years. That 
meeting changed my life. Had it not 
been for Crisis’ action, I truly believe 
I would have never recovered.”
Alongside supporting John with his 
living situation, Crisis matched him 
with James, a Strengths and Assets 
Coach, to help him explore his future 
aspirations. “I was invited to speak 
at a parliamentary event to share 
my experience. Everything clicked 
into place after that; I felt it was my 
calling to use my lived experience 
to help others in similar situations.”
John’s story: 
How our charity partner 
is changing lives
Our partnership with Crisis, the 
UK’s homelessness charity, and 
Simon Community in Northern 
Ireland, works in synergy alongside 
our call for one million more homes 
at social rent over the next decade 
to end homelessness for good. 
Since April 2023, thousands 
of the Group’s colleagues have 
supported this ambition – from 
participating in fundraising events 
to volunteering thousands of hours 
in Crisis shops, Christmas hotels, 
or as mentors. 
“Homelessness is often the 
confluence of three things 
happening simultaneously – 
poor mental health, relationship 
breakdown, or job loss. Most people 
can sustain one of these, but two 
or more at the same time can tip 
an individual into homelessness. 
I experienced the latter two in quick 
succession which led to me sofa

Customers can fund their home improvements in 
a way that works best for them, whether that is savings, 
government grants, additional borrowing, or a combination. 
Since launch, we have provided over 3,500 customers 
with a cashback reward.

efficient. Since 2019, 2.3 billion square feet of real estate 
has been assessed using our Green Buildings Tool. 
In 2024, Commercial Banking supported £1.2 billion of 
new funding which is sustainable1 or sustainability-linked1 
to accelerate our sustainability ambitions, including 
investment in making the UK’s social housing stock more 
energy efficient. Since 2021, we have supported £6 billion 
of new funding in this area.
 
Sustainability reporting standards for social 
housing and housebuilders 
Lloyds Bank and Scottish Widows continue to adopt 
the Sustainability Reporting Standards for Social Housing, 
with colleague representation on the board of Sustainability 
for Housing. In 2024, with support from Lloyds Bank, 
Sustainability for Housing is progressing the transition 
of its data services to Housemark, the leading data and 
insight company for the UK housing sector providing 
benchmarking data.
As one of the largest funders of the UK housebuilding 
sector we know we have an important role to play, both 
in terms of developing the standards for more sustainable 
homes and in providing finance to help housebuilders 
meet these standards. We also merged our housebuilding 
sustainability finance framework into the sustainable 
financing framework in 2024.
In 2021 we joined the executive committee of 
NextGeneration, alongside the UK Green Building Council, 
Homes England and JLL (the initiative secretariat), to help 
drive the creation of sustainability standards for new 
build homes in the UK. The benchmark supports the UK’s 
largest housebuilders in achieving material sustainability 
credentials. Ensuring smaller housebuilders weren’t left 
behind, two new standards were developed, with our 
support, NextGeneration Project and Core – supporting 
small and medium housebuilders begin or accelerate their 
sustainability journeys by reducing complexity and focusing 
on the areas that will make the most difference. 
We continued our sponsorship of the Future Homes 
Conference in 2024 to support the housebuilding sector 
to deliver and comply with the incoming Future Homes 
Standard. At the conference, the Future Homes Hub 
launched its suite of sustainability metrics, aligning 
to the criteria of the NextGeneration Initiative. 
Please refer to page 34 for more on how we support 
businesses on their growth and sustainability journeys.

Encourage companies, 
especially large 
and transnational 
companies, to adopt 
sustainable practices 
and to integrate 
sustainability 
information into 
their reporting cycle.
With the support of Lloyds and 
JLL, Anwyl Homes completed 
the NextGeneration Core

assessment, which focused 
on key sustainability issues and 
allowed Anwyl to benchmark 
itself against the market. The 
assessment clearly identified 
where Anwyl performed well, 
providing a clear focus for 
the future.
The exercise has been 
incredibly beneficial, and we 
can see immediate areas of 
improvement. It shows Anwyl 
Homes is doing many of 
the things expected from 
a sustainability perspective 
and given we do not have a 
sustainability officer, we are 
really pleased with our first 
benchmark score. It’s been 
a very worthwhile exercise 
and will positively change

how we approach and manage 
our sustainability now and 
in the future.”

Access to quality and affordable housing continued
In 2024, the not-for-profit has hosted events in five 
locations in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham 
and Stoke-on-Trent. The ambition is to expand into Leeds, 
Newcastle and Sheffield in 2025 and into all four home 
nations by 2026. Regeneration Brainery has recently 
established an advisory board made up of leading industry 
professionals to provide strategic guidance as the 
enterprise looks to scale up further.
Michele Steel, CEO of Regeneration Brainery said: 
“Regeneration Brainery was founded, is supported by, 
and is for the property industry. We can’t do what we do, 
giving a leg-up to thousands of students each year into 
life-changing career opportunities, without the support 
of our partners. Lloyds Bank has been at the forefront 
of our activities as a Champion Partner since 2021 – giving 
hundreds of hours of volunteering time, mentoring 
individual students in need of support, and providing 
a critical platform to talk about our work and the value 
of diversity to its vast network of clients and industry 
organisations. We can’t wait to see how much greater our 
impact will be working together over the next three years.”
Real Estate Balance: advocating for equity, 
diversity and inclusion
In 2023, we announced a partnership with Real Estate 
Balance, a campaigning organisation working to advance 
equity, diversity and inclusion in UK real estate and its 
associated sectors, with a particular focus on gender, 
ethnicity and social background. Real Estate Balance 
works closely with the industry to support its members 
in making cultural changes and identifying best practices, 
contributing to the enhanced performance of the industry.
SDG 8.5
By 2030, achieve full and 
productive employment and 
decent work for all women and 
men, including for young people 
and persons with disabilities, and 
equal pay for work of equal value.

Industry partnerships and 
supporting skills development
We have renewed our partnership with 
Regeneration Brainery for another 
three years to help tackle the skills 
shortage in the UK property sector – 
giving young people hands-on 
experience and mentorship 
opportunities.
With a severe skills shortage in the sector, the industry 
is struggling to attract talent with the enthusiasm and 
know-how to innovate, meaning demand isn’t being met. 
Our renewed partnership with Regeneration Brainery – 
an award-winning, not-for-profit academy for young 
people which aims to tackle the skills shortage by 
boosting diversity in the property and construction 
industry, and providing young people with hands-
on experience, helps to support this need.
Attracting a wide and diverse talent pool is one of the 
reasons why we partnered with Regeneration Brainery 
in the first place. Regeneration Brainery has won multiple 
awards for delivering positive social impact, and has been 
named as the UK Real Estate Investment and Infrastructure 
Forum’s (UKREiiF) charity partner for a second consecutive 
year. Since its creation in 2017, it’s worked with over 6,000 
students – or Brainees – finding hands-on work experience 
and meaningful networking opportunities with property 
professionals. Over a third of Brainees have joined the 
industry or taken on an industry-specific educational 
opportunity. Over 18,000 volunteering hours have been 
given by over 650 industry mentors based right across 
the UK.

the skills shortage in the UK property sector
Purpose in action
Abiola joined Regeneration Brainery 
whilst studying Finance at Salford 
University. He was on a gap year at 
the time and was not sure what he 
wanted to do after university. 
His older sister had been part of a 
Manchester Bootcamp back in 2017 
and brought him along for the 
Manchester Bootcamp in October 
2021. Inspired by what he found, 
Abiola is now probably our most 
prolific Ambassador, joining us at 
Brainery Weeks, school career fairs, 
conferences and networking events 
all across the UK, including the April 
2024 Manchester Brainery Week. 
Having tried careers in finance and 
event management, Abiola decided 
that property and regeneration was 
right for him and he has recently 
secured a role as a Graduate 
Development Manager at Muse 
Places – Muse’s first ever 
noncognate graduate employee.
Regeneration Brainery has given 
me so many opportunities to 
connect with the property 
industry’s finest. I now want 
to inspire, mentor and support 
the next generation of built 
environment professionals. I plan 
to use my lived experience and 
unique perspective to provide 
value to Brainees on their journey 
into the property industry.”

Empowering customers continued
Putting more money 
in customers’ pockets
In 2024, we transformed the 
way we support our customers. 
We created new products, services 
and experiences built entirely 
around customer needs, to 
financially empower them. 
Supporting our customers to save
We are helping Britain to save with 3.9 million savings 
accounts opened in 2024 alone, and with our ISA products, 
customers have saved an additional £8.1 billion tax-free. 
We were also extremely pleased to launch MBNA Savings 
to our customers, extending our range of accounts across 
our brands and giving our customers even more options 
to find one suitable for their needs.
For those who already bank with us, we take a number 
of steps to make sure our customers are engaging with their 
savings. We contacted over four million deposit customers 
to ensure they are aware of their savings options, including 
limited withdrawal products offering higher rates than 
instant access, whilst retaining flexibility in how savings 
are accessed. We have enhanced the process to open a 
savings account with us, launching in 2024 a ‘one click’ 
process for our most popular savings products.
At the same time, we continue to contact customers on 
variable rate mortgages each year to tell them how much 
they could save by transferring to a lower fixed rate.
New products and tools
We have focused on designing products and services that 
solve some of our customers’ most underserved needs, 
like finding missed benefits or switching bills.
We are also utilising various educational tools and 
platforms to equip our customers and communities with 
the knowledge to empower them to make decisions that 
result in the most prosperous outcomes for themselves. 
Please refer to page 38 for further information on our 
education initiatives.
We have expanded our financial empowerment tools 
through our mobile banking app with the launch 
of the Benefits Calculator and Bill Switcher.
Benefits Calculator
Data from the Group and Policy in Practice 
shows that eight million households across the UK 
are missing out on £23 billion in benefits each year. 
Through our new Benefits Calculator customers can 
find benefits and grants they could be eligible for. 
Using our in-depth calculator (powered by our 
tech partner Inbest), customers can get a more 
detailed view of the estimated amounts they may 
be entitled to, along with next steps on how to 
make a claim. Since the launch of the tool, more 
than one million customers have engaged with it. 
This includes single young professionals who have just 
moved into their first home not taking advantage of 
Council Tax discounts, growing families missing out 
on Child Benefit and Universal Credit, and retirees 
with unclaimed Pension Credit. 
Our ambition is to put at least £500 million in 
customers’ pockets, remaining focused on supporting 
the growth of a resilient customer base.
Bill Switcher
Our data shows that Lloyds Bank customers spend 
37 per cent of their monthly income on regular bills 
and that on average customers could save £220 
on broadband and £250 on mobile bills every year. 
Since the launch in September 2024, over 
300,000 customers have engaged with the tool.
Launched with the help of our tech partner ApTap, 
Bill Switcher makes it easier for customers to find 
deals that could save them money. We’re now 
highlighting our customers’ utility bill payments in 
their app statements to show them where we think 
they can save by switching with just a simple click.

Your Credit Score, a free service 
provided in partnership with 
TransUnion, empowers customers 
with up-to-date insight into 
their credit information, what’s 
affecting their credit score, and 
hints and tips to improve it over 
time. Launched in September 
2021, we have recorded more 
than 11 million registered users, 
with 2.4 million registering in 
2024 alone.
 
In 2024, we supported more 
than 780,000 people making 
improvements using the tool, 
which can help them achieve 
their aspirations – like getting 
car financing or a mortgage to 
buy their first home.
	
 
It also allows customers to 
spot anything that doesn’t look 
right but might have a negative 
impact on their score – as in the 
case of our customer Melissa 
who was tracking her score 
and doing all the right things 
in the run-up to applying for 
a mortgage. But one day she 
noticed her score went down 
due to a new credit card 
account opened in her name. 
This was a fraudulent operation 
which she was able to flag 
quickly and easily through the 
app and it was promptly 
rectified, getting her credit 
score back on track, ensuring 
her mortgage application wasn’t 
affected.

Empowering customers continued
Customers can access support through 
multiple channels to seek help with 
their financial wellbeing or managing 
their money. 
In the moments that matter, we play a key role in supporting 
customers and communities, particularly those who might 
be having difficulty in managing their money. By offering 
tailored solutions and access to essential digital and financial 
skills, we’re empowering individuals to regain control of 
their financial wellbeing. This support ensures customers 
have the tools and knowledge they need to navigate 
challenging financial circumstances and life events, fostering 
resilience and promoting long-term financial stability.
Throughout 2024, we have helped customers across over 
535,000 accounts in financial difficulty by offering tailored 
solutions that meet their needs and help them on the path 
to financial resilience.
Through our Lloyds Bank, Halifax and Bank of Scotland 
branches, customers can book an appointment with a 
specially trained colleague who can support them with any 
money worries. We also had more than 3,000 colleagues 
helping to provide financial assistance to customers in 
financial difficulty through tailored services and products.
We offer customers in financial difficulty easily accessible 
support, either over the phone or online, through: 
•	 Allowing time to seek support: We can offer credit 
card, loans and overdraft customers who need time 
to seek support and guidance a temporary pause 
on all interest and fees, with no contact regarding 
payment during that period
•	 Repayment plans: Mortgage, motor, credit card, 
overdraft and loan customers are able to discuss 
a range of support options, including allowing more 
time for repayment or making reduced payments 
for a period of time
•	 Consolidating debts: Credit card, loans and overdraft 
customers can consolidate their outstanding debt into 
a lower interest loan
•	 Changing products: We offer customers the option 
to secure a new mortgage rate up to four months in 
advance, which provides more flexibility and choice. 
If these rates fall during those four months, customers 
can then switch again to the lower rate. Customers 
on a variable rate, whether they’re up to date on 
payments or not, can switch to a new fixed rate
•	 Mortgage Charter: We remain committed to the 
Mortgage Charter measures and have enhanced our 
customer journeys to enable customers to get the 
support they need

Key resources to support customers
Our Money Worries and Money Management website 
pages across our Lloyds, Halifax, Bank of Scotland 
and MBNA brands are an invaluable resource for 
the over 1.4 million annual visitors. 
1.	 Money Worries pages provide guidance for 
customers likely to be in financial difficulty or 
concerned about keeping up with payments, 
including the ability to directly access tailored 
solutions to help get back to financial health.
2.	 Money Management pages contain resources, 
tools and tips to help customers stay on track 
and manage their finances. 
3.	 External signposting to organisations such as 
StepChange, which provide independent help 
and debt advice as well as support with income 
maximisation
Support tool for customers in vulnerable 
circumstances
Throughout 2024, we have continued with our 
commitment to supporting both colleagues and 
customers in vulnerable situations. Our continued 
expansion of this tool helped us offer appropriate 
solutions based on the impacts and needs identified, 
empowering colleagues to have meaningful 
conversations with customers about their 
circumstances.
This tool was accessed over 120,000 times in 2024 
highlighting the importance of providing colleagues 
with the knowledge and tools to serve our customers. 
Where we are unable to help, where appropriate we will 
look to signpost or refer to external organisations and 
partners, providing customers with additional support.

A customer who had been 
homeless for two years had no way 
to cook and only ate snack foods. 
He was also suffering with health 
issues and waiting for an operation 
on his knee. 
 
He was in receipt of Universal 
Credit and Personal Independence 
Payment but was unsure if he was 
eligible to claim more. This 
customer was looking for advice 
and support to help him find 
somewhere to live.
 
Following our referral to Citizens 
Advice, they gained the customer’s 
consent to contact his local 
authority and was given details 
for a community centre he could 
attend for immediate support.
 
The customer was given a hot 
meal, accommodation for the 
night and assigned an emergency 
case worker to support him to find 
permanent housing.
Understanding the unique needs 
of our customers
We recognise our customers have unique needs and 
circumstances and we are committed to understanding 
and fulfilling these needs. We have introduced features 
on our online and mobile banking platforms that allow 
customers to record their support needs, such as special 
formats for letters and statements or indicating speech 
difficulties and use of British Sign Language. 
Customers are encouraged to communicate their 
requirements with us over the phone, in person and 
online. In 2024, over 2.8 million specific customer support 
needs were registered across our channels, enabling us 
to better meet our customer needs. 
Recording customers’ support needs and sharing them 
with relevant teams is a practical way to ensure customers 
don’t have to repeat difficult conversations. This not only 
streamlines the process but also shows empathy and 
consideration for the customer experience. 
Our help and support hubs across customer websites are 
a rich resource for individuals seeking advice and guidance 
on various financial situations. The inclusion of information 
regarding key life events, health issues and money worries, 
along with signposting to independent organisations and 
charities, is a valuable service for all customers.
Upskilling and training our colleagues 
to support our customers
We strive to be more inclusive every day, encouraging 
colleagues to think inclusively to meet all customers’ needs. 
Our ‘Inclusive for Customers’ training launched in 2024, 
was introduced as a mandatory colleague training module, 
outlining the importance of inclusivity, focusing on 
supporting all customers with their individual needs. 
This training module was awarded 
gold at the Event and Visual 
Communication Association (EVCOM)
awards for Diversity & Inclusion.

Empowering customers continued
Our specialist support teams 
are trained to handle specific 
circumstances requiring extra  
care and bespoke support, which 
demonstrates our dedication 
to addressing individual needs. 
The dedicated phone numbers for these specialist teams 
are accessible on our customer websites, ensuring ease 
of access for those who require specialist assistance. 
Our colleagues are able to make referrals into these 
specialist support teams, reflecting our collaborative 
approach to providing the best possible support for 
customers. This ensures that customers in need are 
identified and connected with the appropriate 
resources and expertise efficiently. 
Trusted persons
The Trusted Person Card and Trusted Person Alerts 
provide extra support for customers needing help with 
their finances. The card allows friends, family and carers 
to assist with everyday purchases and cash access using 
a separate card and PIN. Trusted Person Alerts let 
customers choose someone to receive text updates about 
their account activity without granting access to make 
payments or view balances, ensuring privacy and security. 
We also offer ‘speak on behalf’ for customers who would 
like an informal agreement for a trusted person (such as 
a family member or friend) to speak on their behalf. 
These services have been effective, with over 12,000 
customers benefitting from them.
Supporting customers impacted by gambling
We empower customers to manage their finances and 
control their spending with practical tools. Customers can 
set spending limits and sign up for Gamban directly from 
our websites for additional support. They can also access 
confidential online support and forums through GamCare, 
offering an alternative for those who prefer not to speak 
directly with someone.
Domestic and financial abuse 
Our Domestic and Financial Abuse team has provided 
support to over 13,000 victim-survivors to rebuild their 
finances. Specially trained by the domestic abuse charity 
Surviving Economic Abuse, our colleagues are able to 
support customers in the way that best suits their needs. 
The team also signposts to domestic abuse charities for 
emotional and practical support where needed and takes 
direct referrals from domestic abuse charities. 
Working with experts we have continued to develop our 
domestic abuse training module, providing colleagues with 
a stronger understanding of what domestic and financial 
abuse is and how we’re able to support our customers. 
We work closely with Surviving Economic Abuse, learning 
from its experts, including victim-survivors of financial 
abuse, to inform and evolve our strategy and enhance our 
support for colleagues and customers. Throughout 2024, 
we have supported over 4,500 victim-survivors of domestic 
and financial abuse.
Customers are able to seek support without the need to 
leave home by calling us, using our secure messaging system 
via our websites, or requesting a call-back from one of our 
dedicated case handlers.
Empowering our customers in all circumstances 
In 2024, our specialist support teams provided 
dedicated support to all customers affected by: 
01
Domestic and financial abuse – offering 
tailored support to empower customers in 
regaining financial control including opening 
new accounts, separation of joint accounts, 
supporting with debt and more.

Overview

Empowering customers continued
Our customer endured over 10 years 
of physical and financial abuse in 
their marriage. They had a joint 
account but were not allowed to 
access funds without permission. 
All bills were their responsibility, and 
their partner, who rarely worked, 
demanded financial support, 
resorting to violence if unmet. 
To cover essential bills, the customer 
frequently used their overdraft. After 
an incident at home, they left the 
relationship. The customer struggled 
to support themselves and their 
children due  accumulated debt.
We then helped the customer open 
a new account with a non-
geographical sort code to protect 
their financial independence and 
privacy. They were also referred to 
external support organisations like 
Surviving Economic Abuse and 
Women’s Aid.
Supporting our customers’ needs 
We want all our customers to have an excellent experience 
and be able to access our services in a way that is right for 
them, wherever they are. We are committed to making 
banking accessible and inclusive for everyone.
The Recite Me tool is available on our Halifax website, 
giving customers a range of tools to help access the 
website, supporting our neurodiverse customers and those 
with visual impairments. 
The Lloyds Bank Digital Helpline offers a range of services 
to support customers with hearing loss or who are d/Deaf. 
We also offer Signly, a pioneering British Sign Language 
(BSL) translation application on our Lloyds Bank, Halifax 
and Bank of Scotland customer websites, supporting our 
d/Deaf customers. 
Our inclusive design and delivery toolkits are practical 
resources that help our teams adopt inclusive approaches 
throughout the planning and delivery process. We ensure 
our teams have the tools to build and test their content 
and systems, incorporating accessibility standards into 
our methods for delivering change. We collaborate with 
the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) to improve our 
websites and apps to make them more accessible to 
customers, particularly those with physical disabilities 
and impairments.
In 2024, we introduced an Inclusive Design Panel in 
partnership with the social business, Three Hands. 
The panel is comprised of individuals with lived experience 
of various circumstances and experts from charities and 
support organisations. This panel reviews, tests, critiques

and provides ideas on different products, improving 
accessibility and making products and services 
more available. 
Inclusivity in access to banking
People experiencing homelessness, financial abuse, 
survivors of modern slavery, refugees, asylum seekers 
and prisoners are all demographics that may face greater 
difficulties in accessing banking services. Our commitment 
to financial empowerment is reflected in being the largest 
provider of basic bank accounts in the UK. 
Throughout 2024, we worked with HM Prison and 
Probation Service supporting 48 prisons across the UK 
to provide prison leavers with basic bank accounts and 
face-to-face education and skills training. This training 
enables prison leavers to learn money and digital skills, 
along with the skills needed to get back into work. We 
continue to financially empower our customers by ensuring 
they have access to essential banking services, which are 
crucial for securing housing and achieving financial stability.
We’re able to offer customers who do not hold standard 
identification a bank account, through our non-standard 
ID processes. This offering allows us to directly address 
a common hurdle that people may face when trying 
to establish a financial foothold.
It’s important we understand the things we can do 
to support customers who don’t speak English as their 
first language, if they need extra help. Our introduction 
of translation services in branches and over the phone 
is enabling customers to take advantage of products 
and services they previously may have not accessed, 
with over 108,000 customers using the service. 
This year, we have received accreditations and awards to recognise our support for customers with 
disabilities. In 2024, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute charity has awarded Lloyds Bank, 
Halifax and Bank of Scotland an ‘Advanced’ rating through its ‘Mental Health Accessible’ programme for 
banks and essential services. We also received the National Autistic Society’s prestigious Autism Friendly 
Award, marking our commitment to become the UK’s first autism-friendly bank.

Empowering 
long-term 
security
We want our customers and 
communities to be equipped with the 
right tools to build prosperity at every 
stage of their life. Our purpose in 
Helping Britain Prosper includes the 
long-term security of our customers 
and communities.
Through Scottish Widows and the wider Group, we have 
focused on increasing the accessibility and education 
around long-term planning – building financial security 
for people through pensions, investments and 
insurance products. 
The UK has the largest pension market in Europe, worth 
over £2 trillion. Over the past decade, automatic enrolment 
has helped an extra 10 million people save for their futures, 
increasing the proportion of Britons who now have a stake 
in society through their pension pots. 
Our annual retirement reports have identified the different 
areas that impact our customers and their communities’ 
long-term security. They have also identified the ways 
we can support to reduce inequality and insecurity 
in those areas.
We have developed and expanded 
our tools and resources to support 
our customers in securing their futures, 
whilst growing the Group’s assets under 
administration.
Ready-Made Pensions
Built and managed by our experts, a Ready-Made 
Pension can help customers manage their pension 
savings and plan for retirement – making it easier to 
save for the future. Customers can view, track and top 
up their pension any time, all in one place, using the 
mobile banking app. Investments are made through 
Scottish Widows based on the planned retirement age.
Ready-Made Investments
Our Ready-Made Investments contain investments 
picked by our experts, helping take the worry and 
confusion away from investing. Investing is flexible 
starting with £50 per month and an adjustable level 
of risk. All funds are ready-made and managed by 
our experts. 
Beat the Gap
This tool was launched on International Women’s Day 
by Scottish Widows. Beat the Gap is intended to show 
when and how the gender pension gap can typically 
emerge across the average woman’s life and provide the 
top three ways to beat that gap. Using the information 
provided, plus some assumptions, Beat the Gap uses UK 
average data on pensions, earnings and childcare to 
show how answers could impact a future pension pot.
Pension Mirror
Using AI technology, the tool scans the user’s face and 
guesses their age. It then tells them the average pension 
savings for other people their age using the Office for 
National Statistics data, encouraging the comparison of 
their personal pension savings and engagement with the 
Scottish Widows app alongside education over pensions.
Retirement report 
Scottish Widows’ 20th annual retirement report 
reflects on some of the big changes over the last two 
decades which have decisively impacted how people 
prepare for retirement. The report focuses on the 
issues which face the UK and sets out what needs 
to be done to address these challenges. 
Our report shows that although retirement is going 
well for most of today’s retirees, some are negatively 
impacted by financial concerns or health problems, 
with growing differences between those who are 
enjoying retirement today and those who are thinking 
about what retirement might look like in the future. 
It also considers divergences in retirement conditions, 
preparation and outcomes across ethnicity, disability 
and the LGBTQ+ community.
Women and retirement report 
Scottish Widows’ women and retirement report, 
also in its 20th year, examines the progress that 
has been made in closing the gender pensions gap 
– the difference between women’s retirement 
savings and men’s.
This latest report notes that on the current trajectory 
of change, it will take at least another 20 years before 
the gender pension gap is closed but acknowledges 
the impact of positive interventions such as the 
introduction of automatic enrolment, which has 
seen more women than ever saving into a workplace 
pension. It calls for a Lifetime Savings Commission 
to be set up, to enable all forms of retirement savings 
to be evaluated and avoid short-term policy changes 
that create complexity, confusion and impact 
consumer confidence in saving.
Urgent action is also required to help tackle 
the gender pension gap. Education on how 
to support women with the steps to engage 
in their pension early is a must, but when 
combined with policy changes it will play 
a crucial role in helping all women actively 
take control of their pensions and start 
thinking about future savings decisions.”

The Scottish Widows Care 
proposition for Scottish Widows 
Protect (SWP) policies includes 
built-in benefits at no additional 
cost. Clinic in a Pocket (CiAP), 
RedArc and Macmillan Cancer 
Support provide practical and 
emotional support for you and 
your family during times of need. 
They are available to you, your 
partner, and your children (up to 
age 23) from the start of the plan, 
without requiring a claim.
CiAP is a 24-hour GP service that 
allows customers to access a GP 
anytime, anywhere in the world. 
Appointments can be booked for a 
15-minute video call, during which 
the GP can offer specialist referrals 
or medical prescriptions. Between 
January and August 2024, there 
were 550 consultations from 
Scottish Widows customers by CiAP, 
with 16 per cent involving children 
under 15. Notably, 48.5 per cent of 
referrals were from repeat users, 
underscoring the service’s value. This 
service is designed to complement, not 
replace, face-to-face GP appointments.
RedArc offers a personal nurse 
support service, where a nurse is 
assigned based on the specific 
medical condition and remains 
available by telephone on a long-term 
basis. The support includes long-term 
emotional assistance, preparation for 
consultant appointments, signposting 
to self-help groups and sourcing 
medical aids. From January to August 
2024, 25 new cases were registered 
with RedArc, slightly above the 
year-on-year average of 21 since 2018, 
with over 150 communications made 
across these cases.
Scottish Widows contributed to an 
industry-led engagement campaign 
coordinated by the Association of 
British Insurers (ABI) and the Pensions 
and Lifetime Savings Association 
(PLSA) encouraging people to engage 
and learn about their pensions 
through three simple steps:
1.	 Find out if you have any lost 
pension pots.
2.	 Log in to pensions accounts 
and check what you’ll get 
when you retire.
3.	 Picture your future self and 
how much you’ll need.
Please refer here 
 for more 
information on this campaign.
Since the launch of the Scottish 
Widows and Macmillan 
Partnership, 834 customers have 
benefitted from Macmillan’s 
support through signposting and 
conversations. Collectively, these 
customers have benefitted 
financially by over £405,000 as a 
result of this relationship. 
Macmillan is on hand to support 
customers with emotional, 
practical and financial support and 
its advisers can help you to find 
the right type of support for you. 
Due to the success of the 
partnership, in 2023 it was agreed 
to extend by another five years.

Mansion House Compact
Scottish Widows is proud to be one of the nine original 
signatories to the Mansion House Compact – a pledge 
from the UK’s largest defined contribution pension 
providers, committing them to the objective of allocating 
five per cent of assets in their default funds to unlisted 
equities by 2030. 
Responsible for £100 billion of pension investments 
on behalf of 4.5 million customers, Scottish Widows 
has an important role to play in giving customers access 
to high growth and early-stage companies from across the 
UK and the wider world, with the potential for improved 
returns and a more comfortable retirement.
With a long-term investment horizon, our ability to invest 
in the industries of the future ensures we align customers’ 
interests with the providers of goods and services they 
will rely on in the moments that matter through each 
stage of their lives.
And as these businesses grow and serve new markets, 
so will their capacity for job creation. Providing not 
only goods and services, but also the jobs of the future. 
Just another way in which Lloyds Banking Group 
is Helping Britain Prosper.

Empowering British businesses is central to our core 
purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. We are proud to 
be by the side of a diverse range of British businesses, 
supporting over 900,000 businesses and entrepreneurs 
with leading digital and relationship banking services, 
as they start up, grow and thrive, establishing deep 
and valuable customer relationships for the Group.
Our aim is to create an inclusive environment that 
empowers growth and development across a diverse 
range of businesses. We believe we can only prosper 
when businesses and communities across all parts 
of the UK have the right opportunities to succeed. 
We are listening to businesses and working with others 
to broaden our expertise and are doing more to understand 
the barriers that businesses face. We are working hard 
to put the right programmes of mentoring, upskilling 
and networking in place, as well as tools and services 
that meet the specific needs of our business customers. 
We continue to provide dedicated support to businesses 
that may need guidance in navigating challenging times. 
We remain focused on empowering underserved 
business owners from diverse backgrounds and have 
continued to create specific outreach programmes and 
mentoring to enable these entrepreneurs to thrive.

Empowering businesses to grow
Supporting businesses through every stage
In 2024, the Group continued to play a crucial role in 
empowering and investing in businesses of every size, scale 
and location. From the early guidance and funding needed 
by entrepreneurs, to supporting larger companies and 
enterprises as they expand and grow.
Our support to businesses goes beyond financing. 
We’ve supported over 200,000 businesses via the Lloyds 
Bank Academy with interactive webinars and mentoring. 
Since the launch in 2023, we have also supported over 
700 businesses via our Start-Up, Scale-Up programme 
– which is designed to help entrepreneurs and early-
stage businesses achieve their growth aspirations.
In 2024, we continued to provide dedicated support 
to businesses that may need guidance in navigating 
challenging times. We proactively reached out to 
approximately 82,000 businesses via direct SMS, emails 
or engagement with relationship managers.
During 2024, we partnered with CBI Economics to publish 
the report Realising Regional Potential, which identified and 
assessed high-value, emerging clusters throughout the UK. 
Business clusters are engines of growth, helping businesses to 
drive innovation, investment, productivity and job creation. 
As we collectively navigate the challenges and opportunities 
ahead of us, sector clusters continue to be key for economic 
growth. Leveraging our economy’s local strengths and 
specialisms is therefore crucial to fostering development 
and prosperity throughout the UK.
Please refer to supporting regional development and 
communities on page 41 to find out more about how we 
are creating opportunities for businesses and communities 
in lower income places.
Be the Business 
In 2024, through our partnership with Be the Business (BtB) 
we helped UK small and medium enterprise (SME) leaders 
improve the financial and operational performance of their 
business through greater productivity. 94 businesses have 
now benefitted from a Be the Business programme, and 
we have also provided 32 volunteers to the programme, 
enabling colleagues to support SMEs with their skills 
and expertise. 
British Chambers of Commerce 
In 2024, we announced our second partnership with 
the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), working 
together to support more SMEs with their 
international trade ambitions. 
The partnership is developing research to better 
understand the trade barriers faced by business. 
It is also bringing together SMEs from across the UK 
to explore the practical support and solutions they 
need to help them prosper on the global stage.

Empowering diverse businesses
We understand that an important part 
of empowering underserved business 
owner communities is through helping 
to break down the socio-economic 
barriers that impact them. 
In 2024 we, alongside our partner network, have invested 
over 32,000 hours of targeted support for over 9,000 
Black, women and disabled entrepreneurs through our 
programmes and initiatives that are underpinned by 
data-led research and actions. Supporting long-term 
inclusive growth for the Group, we have focused on 
providing tools and services tailored for different need, 
but supporting growth and development for all.
Disabled entrepreneur support
In 2024, we have continued to listen and learn from the 
disabled entrepreneur community, whilst progressing 
actions internally and helping to convene the ecosystem on 
systemic change. We have collaborated with Small Business 
Britain to host networking events, provide mentorship and 
learning opportunities, and promote visibility of disabled 
role models – all aimed at empowering disabled 
entrepreneurs to thrive. We are also co-creating new 
propositions and services with active consultation on the 
design process by disabled entrepreneurs to enable better 
outcomes for customers. 
>32k hours 
of targeted support for over 9,000 Black, 
women and disabled entrepreneurs
Disabled entrepreneurs represent a vital yet often 
overlooked segment of the UK’s business community 
and we are proud to have taken a lead role in supporting 
this agenda through research and engagement with 
the community, whilst championing systemic change. 
By creating equitable opportunities to start and grow 
businesses for disabled entrepreneurs, according to the 
Lilac Review, an estimated £230 billion could be added 
to the economy alongside the provision of a strong basis 
for inclusive banking more broadly. 
In February 2024, we were proud to host the launch of 
the Lilac Review – an independent, government-backed 
initiative designed to identify and overcome the barriers 
faced by disabled business owners. The Lilac Review’s 
Interim Report was released in May 2024, an in-depth 
study that explored the challenges faced by disabled 
entrepreneurs including the structural barriers encountered 
when starting and growing a business. The report included 
a series of actionable recommendations for government, 
financial services and business support organisations. 
In December 2024, we became a founding signatory of 
the Disability Finance Code for Entrepreneurship, backed 
by the Department for Business and Trade (DBT), and 
designed to increase the pipeline of disabled entrepreneurs 
accessing finance across the industry. In 2025, we will be 
evidencing our commitment towards the code objectives.

Overview
Amelia Peckham, co-founder of 
Cool Crutches & Walking Sticks, 
acquired her disability at the age 
of 19 following a serious accident. 
Along with her mum Clare, she 
founded her business in 2006. 
They sell comfortable, colourful, safe 
and silent crutches and walking sticks 
that are designed to reflect the user’s 
personality and style ahead of their 
injury or disability. The company 
is growing rapidly and has gained 
significant recognition – including 
numerous awards, press coverage 
and celebrity endorsements for her 
products. Amelia is very passionate 
about actively championing the 
disabled community and is celebrated 
as a role model amongst her peers. 
 
Amelia has been working closely 
with Lloyds Bank in addressing the 
needs of disabled entrepreneurs. 
The Lilac Review Interim Report 
emphasised the importance 
of including disabled entrepreneurs 
in the development and review 
of financial products and services. 
Amelia joined us in leading a cohort 
of eight disabled entrepreneurs 
for a two-day co-creation event. 
Through this event the entrepreneurs 
collaborated with product and 
inclusion specialists, designing new 
product and service concepts focused 
on flexibility and accessibility. 
Amelia has recently switched her 
banking to Lloyds Bank due to the 
positive steps we are taking to 
support disabled business owners, 
enabling more equitable access 
to opportunities. 
For so long inclusivity and 
accessibility has been a topic of 
conversation – an important one 
but invariably not one that’s led 
to much change, until now. 
The Lilac Review has been 
focused on change from its 
inception, not just talking the talk 
but walking the walk. For me it 
gives hope, action and renewed 
passion to a community that has 
been left out for far too long. The 
Lilac Review is pivotal in proving 
change for our community is not 
only a priority but it’s happening 
and that is about the most 
exciting prospect for us as 
individuals but also as founders 
and disabled-led businesses too. 
 
‘You can’t be what you can’t see’ 
is a phrase that we are passionate 
about, one that’s integral to 
change – we need to be visible, 
we need to be in the room, part 
of the conversations and included 
in the mission to drive change 
and I’m delighted to say the Lilac 
Review does just that! It includes 
us, it encourages us, it highlights 
our value and power in a way that 
instils confidence and hope for 
a better future for everyone. 
What’s not to love!”
I know I bang on but what you are 
doing is genuinely ground-breaking, 
the approach you are taking is 
exemplary and the atmosphere 
yesterday was like nothing I’ve 
experienced before. This is and will 
continue to be life-changing for our 
community and your team are such 
a force of knowledge and action, 
it is so exciting to see!”

As part of our ongoing commitment to the Investing in 
Women Code, we are dedicating resources to initiatives 
that promote the growth and scaling of women-led 
businesses through improvements in access to finance, 
networks and other key resources. Lloyds Banking Group 
is also actively involved with the Invest in Women 
Taskforce. Backed by DBT, the taskforce aims to enable 
more women to start and grow their businesses. 
In addition, we continue to engage with the Women 
in Manufacturing initiative, a network of industry and 
academic professionals dedicated to promoting inclusion in 
the sector. We have supported the ‘Changing Perceptions’ 
conference in September 2024 for the second year and 
continue to work with individuals and businesses in the 
industry to produce content such as articles and podcasts 
to discuss how inclusion will support the skills gap.
Black entrepreneur support
The support we provide for Black entrepreneurs continues 
to grow in awareness and impact, including close 
relationships with community partners, sustained visibility 
and authentic presence providing a platform to deepen 
support. Our actions remain centred around the 
recommendations and calls to action from our research 
reports – ‘Black. British. In Business & Proud’ (BBiBP) 
 
In 2024, we engaged over 5,000 Black entrepreneurs 
with over 20,000 hours of support through the events 
and initiatives that make up the programme. 
Some of the highlights include: 
Women entrepreneur support
We have engaged over 3,000 women entrepreneurs with 
over 11,000 hours of support through events and initiatives 
in 2024. We have continued to work with partners such 
as Leeds Business School at Leeds Beckett University for 
the #WECAN project and sponsored the Female Founders 
Rise community in 2024.
Black in Business 
 our partnership with Channel 4 
to provide Black businesses with £500,000 worth 
of TV advertising resulted in 21 million views of these 
commercials; we have renewed this partnership for 
2025. Each winner reported significant growth in 
brand awareness and opportunities arising from the 
campaign. Grant funding and expert mentor sessions 
were provided to five ‘Rising Stars’, who reported 
this support contributed to increased revenue, 
operational efficiency and team morale.
Immerse 
 in partnership with Foundervine, we 
ran our third year of the programme including: two 
accelerators for early-stage and growth businesses 
with grant funding distributed to the winners of the 
end of programme showcase day.

Supporting skills development
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) 
are a critical force in sustaining good, 
well-paid employment in the UK. 
We have continued to equip SMEs 
through levy transfer with the funding 
and knowledge to invest in skills and 
create local employment for young 
people and adults. 
The Group is amongst the largest private sector donors 
to SMEs and by end of 2024, we committed financial 
support to over 1,700 apprentices, employed by over 
1,200 businesses to a cumulative value of £18.9 million. 
Through this support we continue to champion skills 
development, education and sustainable employment 
for young people and adults in line with our strategy 
of Helping Britain Prosper.
The Lloyds Bank Levy Transfer fund has been supporting 
SMEs to take on more apprentices by covering the costs 
of apprenticeship training since 2019. Lloyds Bank has made 
25 per cent of its apprenticeship levy available to support 
the UK economy grow through the upskilling and training 
of apprentices across the UK. 
The Group completed its largest single apprenticeship 
levy donation to date in 2024 with £540,000 funding 45 
educators at St. Bart’s Multi-Academy Trust in Stoke-on-
Trent to upskill their use of educational technology in 
the classroom and management of schools, improving 
operational efficiency and educational outcomes as part 
of St. Bart’s Digital Champion Programme. The programme 
continues to empower and equip educators with digital 
skills and tools and strengthen the culture of growth 
and development. 
The Group continues to emphasise the importance of 
skills development in manufacturing, primarily through 
its partnership with the Manufacturing Technology Centre 
(MTC) training centre. Through our partnership with the 
MTC, small businesses in the local area can access funding 
to enable the development of their existing workforces, 
as well as improving career opportunities for young people. 
The Levy Transfer can be used to fund both Level 3 and 
Level 4 apprenticeships, delivered from the MTC’s training 
centre based in Coventry and Oxfordshire.

Dalgety 
Teas
Mark Dalgety, born in London and 
raised in Guyana, is one of the five 
beneficiaries of the 2024 Channel 4 
and Lloyds Bank, Black In Business 
initiative. The origins of Dalgety 
Teas can be traced back to Brixton 
Market in 1993 after a conversation 
with a trader who wanted to source 
Cerassie/Corilla tea bush from the 
Caribbean. After making £8,000 
from that one order and realising 
there was a gap in the market, the 
idea to develop it into a business 
was born and orders soon began 
to pour in.
As the sole initial distributor, Mark 
knocked on the doors of 50 shops 
per day, establishing a network 
of customers across the country. 
Now, you’ll find them in over 3,000 
independent stores throughout the 
UK and three major supermarkets 
— Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco.
We see the Black In 
Business initiative as 
an opportunity for Black 
owned businesses to 
promote, advertise and 
showcase their products 
and services. The initiative 
also allows other 
communities and 
demographics to benefit 
from innovative products 
and services that under 
normal circumstances 
they might not have been 
exposed or privy to.”

Overview
Our commitment to becoming a 
more digitally inclusive financial service 
provider is an important part of our 
aim to help our customers prosper.
 
Our digital initiatives and tools demonstrate our dedication 
to providing practical support and resources to empower 
individuals facing various financial challenges and life 
events. We are helping businesses and communities scale 
and grow through building their digital skills.
 
In 2024, over 840,000 customers, individuals and small 
businesses have been empowered with financial and digital 
capability support. We have worked with social housing 
associations, a charity and local authorities to provide 
face-to-face support. We offer housebound and low 
digitally confident people with the only industry Digital 
Helpline, which provides free support, data and devices.
 
Online, we offer a free open-sourced set of essential digital 
skills, employability and financial skills training, created 
in partnership with internal experts and external partners. 
For customers, we embed support in key customer 
journeys, and offer expertise and content to our large 
clients and charity partners. For small businesses, 
mentoring and coaching has also been provided.
Consumer Digital Index 
The annual publication of the Consumer Digital Index 
report, illustrates our continued commitment to tracking 
and analysing people’s behaviours and attitudes towards 
technology, online services and financial wellbeing. This 
report serves as a significant resource for understanding 
the evolving digital landscape in the UK. The report is used 
by UK Government, devolved nations and local authorities, 
industry and the charity sector. 
The integration of the Essential Digital Skills Benchmark 
into the Consumer Digital Index Report provides a 
comprehensive view of the digital skills necessary for 
independent internet access and is a crucial tool for 
assessing, informing and improving digital literacy. 
Supporting the UK government through our proactive 
approach in defining and measuring the Essential Digital 
Skills Framework, we aim to reinforce our broader 
commitment to Helping Britain Prosper through 
supporting societal wellbeing and education.

Overview
Empowering a prosperous future continued
Empowering education continued
We believe that early exposure to 
financial education empowers young 
people to manage their money 
effectively as they transition to 
financial independence. That’s why 
we continue to support children and 
young adults across the UK, helping 
them understand the value of money, 
manage their day-to-day finances and 
develop financial resilience. 
Our efforts are primarily delivered face-to-face by 
colleague volunteers in schools and further education 
establishments, through both centrally managed campaigns 
and do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives. The impact of education 
extends beyond the young people we engage with, 
reaching their families and wider communities.
Regardless of the delivery channel, we provide a range of 
free resources for use available for download via the Lloyds 
Bank Academy site. Resources used for financial education 
in schools are Quality Mark accredited, the UK’s only widely 
recognised accreditation system for financial resources. 
Employers can integrate this content into their apprenticeship 
and graduate enrichment programmes, and our materials 
are accessible for colleagues to support their own families, 
friends, networks and communities.

For the first time in the

Whitchurch High School, 
Cardiff to deliver age-

our Quality Marked resources 
to students with Additional 
Learning Needs (ALN). 
In partnering with this 
school, we worked with 
students aged 11-16 years, 
using ‘Keeping my Money 
Safe’ and ‘Staying Safe 
with Digital Money’ 
modules ensuring they 
were appropriate for 
the learning needs of the 
students in attendance.
Making money meaningful with financial education
In 2024, around 300 colleagues used their skills and 
resources to deliver face-to-face financial education 
lessons to over 2,600 students in 26 different educational 
environments across the UK. We continue to work with 
Young Enterprise to ensure that the learning outcomes 
of our resources align with recommendations from the 
Money and Pensions Service, and we collaborate with 
peer organisations through our engagement with UK 
Finance. We also actively promote Talk Money Week. 
Our ambitions for 2025 include scaling up DIY activities 
by colleagues in their local communities.
Resources for our customers 
Aiming to empower and uplift our customers’ capability 
and confidence, we have developed a multi-channel and 
multi-brand offering that provides digital and financial 
support. With partners, we have researched, co-created 
and tested materials to meet customer needs face-to-
face, over the phone and online. Across 2024, over 
623,000 individuals will have received meaningful 
support, including over 4,700 receiving free devices 
and data – thanks to partnerships with Vodafone, 
Assurant and WeAreGroup. Our involvement reflects 
a comprehensive approach to improving digital and 
financial participation. Our efforts to provide practical 
support, resources and training to individuals facing 
financial challenges and digital exclusion are making 
a material difference.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Helping Britain Prosper means 
committing to realising the potential 
of all of the UK’s regions. Our Regional 
Development programme actively 
creates opportunities for further 
investment and growth to support 
communities, businesses and 
sustainable returns for the Group.
The Group recognises there is still more that can be done 
to help address regional inequality and create thriving 
communities. Recent research shows that our larger, 
regional cities such as Liverpool, Birmingham and Leeds 
have considerable potential for economic growth and 
social regeneration and are falling behind their European 
counterparts. Maximising the economic prosperity 
of these places could lead to the UK economy growing 
by an additional £100 billion per year1.
Our Regional Development programme
To harness this opportunity, our Regional Development 
programme was established with three main objectives: 
•	 Creating economic opportunity
•	 Regenerating housing and communities
•	 Capturing the benefits of net zero transition 
Working alongside our clients and partners, we aim 
to continue Helping Britain Prosper by increasing the 
flow of funding into the UK’s regions and nations.
Funding regional opportunities
One way in which we’re stimulating increased investment 
in the UK’s lower income regions is through deployment 
of funding from our Regional Impact Fund (the fund). We’ve 
committed £1 billion to support opportunities in the UK’s 
regions which are aligned with our Regional Development 
objectives. The fund is allocated specifically to projects 
that will have significant social, economic or environmental 
impact at a regional level.
Our first transaction from the fund was the provision 
of £43 million of funding to support the Community 
Development Finance sector. You can read more about 
this in the case study on page 44.
A key objective of our fund is to support social and affordable 
housing in alignment with the Group’s overall strategic 
priorities. An early example is our funding to Breck Homes, 
enabling the development of sites for social and affordable 
housing in the North-West of England. Many of these 
developments are located in some of the most deprived 
areas in the UK and our funding will accelerate growth plans, 
allowing Breck Homes to continue to help to meet the 
growing demand for this type of housing. 
For further information on how we are supporting access 
to social and affordable housing refer to page 19.
A key objective of our fund is 
to support social and affordable 
housing in alignment with the

Small businesses play a key role 
in our economy with 99 per cent 
of all businesses in the UK being 
classified as small.
We help small businesses in many 
ways including providing bank 
accounts, funding, advice on starting 
and running a business, and digital 
skills. We also support Community 
Development Finance Institutions 
(CDFIs) which are small, non-profit 
lenders who provide finance to 
local businesses, often in the most 
disadvantaged communities. Around 
50 per cent of CDFI lending is to 
areas in the UK’s 35 per cent most 
deprived regions and CDFIs have 
a strong regional focus. 
They also finance a greater number 
of female-and-Minority-Ethnic-group-
led businesses than average.
During 2024, we provided £43 million 
of funding to three CDFIs based 
in Doncaster, Wolverhampton 
and Bradford, as part of a 
£62 million fund, supporting 
small businesses and growing 
sustainable returns for the 
Group. This ground-breaking 
commitment is the first 
commercial loan made to the 
sector by a mainstream UK 
lender and aims to invest in 800 
businesses, supporting around 
10,500 jobs. Aligning with 
our purpose, this represents 
a source of sustainable return 
for the Group.
Building on this investment, 
we are now playing a leadership 
role in scaling the sector, 
including providing grants to 
CDFIs to help them expand 
their capacity and capability. 
We are also working 
collaboratively to encourage 
the flow of finance into the 
sector from other lenders.

Support for higher education is at the 
very heart of our purpose of Helping 
Britain Prosper. It’s for this reason that, 
across the UK, the Group has a 
relationship with over 70 per cent of 
higher education institutions and is 
the lead bank to 30 per cent of larger 
universities, winning more tenders in 
2024 and continuing to drive our 
sustainable growth.
For example, we provided a £100 
million revolving credit facility to the 
University of Glasgow to support its 
liquidity during its ambitious capital 
investment programme. The 
programme includes the development 
of a new state-of-the-art building 
dedicated to learning, teaching and 
research, which will have the capacity 
to accommodate 3,600 students.
However, we also recognise that 
both the UK’s universities and the 
UK’s regions are facing significant, 
and well-recognised, challenges as 
the 21st century economy develops. 
During the year, working alongside 
PwC UK, we engaged leaders across 
the nation, from higher education, 
industry, finance and city and 
regional government.
These discussions culminated in the 
co-authoring of a report, ‘Drivers 
of growth: Universities’ enhanced 
civic role at the heart of national 
prosperity’ 
 where we set out 
the opportunities to address these 
challenges, by placing our universities 
at the heart of the revival of the 
UK’s regions. 
The report sets out practical 
recommendations, for example how 
successful universities place their 
regions at the heart of their purpose 
and strategy, and how enduring 
partnerships between regional 
education institutions, businesses 
and public bodies can provide the 
foundations for long-term success. 
One example which we showcase 
in the report is the work of the 
Manufacturing Technology Centre 
(MTC). The MTC works closely with 
its three Midlands-based founding 
universities – Birmingham, 
Nottingham and Loughborough – 
and over a dozen others. The Group 
has committed £15 million total 
sponsorship to the MTC since its 
inception and we expect to exceed 
our commitment of supporting the 
training and upskilling of more than 
6,000 apprentices, graduates and 
engineers in manufacturing by the 
end of 2029. 
The MTC offers programmes that 
address key challenges such as 
supply chain resilience, digital 
transformation, and new product 
or process development. To date, 
participating businesses have 
collectively gained around £7.2 
million of business benefit through 
increased revenue, cost reduction 
and profit growth.

In January 2024, LDC exited its 
investment in Bristol-based 
business Cakesmiths to Onoré. 
During the two-year partnership, 
LDC supported Cakesmiths to 
secure high-profile client wins, 
significantly upgrade its digital 
platforms to almost treble revenue 
and EBITDA whilst also investing 
heavily in its workforce and 
operations.
The business remains based in 
Bristol with all its cakes handmade 
by a growing team of 180 from 
the local area, including talented 
bakers. The business has an 
inclusive approach that caters to 
a wide range of palates, including 
a broad vegan and very-low gluten 
range, and prides itself on exciting 
innovation and limited edition 
‘small batch’ runs. All Cakesmiths 
packaging is fully recyclable 
reflecting the business’ 
commitment to reducing waste 
to landfill whilst keeping products 
fresh during distribution. Customer 
and colleague needs remain at 
the heart of their operations, with 
a continued focus on providing 
high-quality service and products 
led by a local workforce.
LDC continues to be committed to 
supporting regional development 
through partnership with 
entrepreneurs and businesses 
throughout Britain – using private 
equity as a catalyst for growth, 
change and sustainability.
“This is the second time I’ve 
worked with LDC and, as always, 
they are a class act who have 
supported us every step of the 
way. I like the way that LDC 
support management and 
challenge us to be better 
in many different ways.”

Investing in education: The Edwin Group
LDC exited its investment in 
The Edwin Group (the group) to 
Quad Partners in 2024 following 
a successful three-and-a-half year 
partnership. The Newcastle-based 
group is a purpose-led education 
services provider, employing 
a team of dedicated, education 
specialists who work nationally 
to safely recruit and retain the 
highest quality leaders, teachers 
and support staff.
Through this partnership 
The Edwin Group has expanded 
to work with over 4,500 schools 
across the UK and opened nine 
new locations. Over the past year 
the group recruited over 11,000 
teaching and support staff, 
equipping them with the skills they 
need to support schools and their 
young people. The group’s tailored 
approach to providing education 
solutions that address systemic 
With the team at LDC’s support, we are now better 
equipped than ever to meet schools’ and multi-academy 
trusts’ increasingly complex needs. Importantly, we’ve 
been able to grow the business and expand our range 
of products and services without losing sight of our 
values or our commitment to excellent customer service."

challenges in the sector has 
made them the long-term partner 
of choice for schools and multi-
academy trusts. Mental Health 
Champions have been trained 
across the group to support their 
community through their bespoke 
solution, Still Human. Still Human 
educates schools on how to better 
support staff wellbeing, improve 
workplace culture, reduce stress 
and boost staff retention.
The group is committed to its ESG 
responsibilities and was awarded 
ESG Excellent status following 
an independent third-party audit 
by Sustainable Advantage for 
its ongoing work and investment. 
The Edwin Group is proud to have

Woodland Trust
We’re contributing to a greener and more sustainable 
future through our partnership with Woodland Trust 
and our commitment to planting 10 million trees 
over 10 years to the end of the decade. 
To meet the UK’s goal of net zero carbon emissions 
by 2050, woodland cover needs to increase from 
13 per cent to 19 per cent, (the equivalent to 1.5 billion 
trees) but the UK currently has one of the lowest levels 
of woodland cover in Europe, (25th out of 28 countries). 
Our partnership contributes towards this goal, 
while also enabling colleagues to volunteer with 
the Woodland Trust in both tree planting 
and inventory activity.

B4SI aligned community investment in 2024
As a Group we have a duty to help 
support communities facing challenges 
such as social disadvantage, housing 
problems and poor financial education 
as well as the wider issue of the 
transition to net zero, which affects 
us all, through investment and skills. 
Through our Community Engagement programme, we work 
with a range of specialist partners, leveraging our skills and 
scale to help create a more inclusive and sustainable society. 
Our investment into communities takes on many forms, 
including direct cash donations, colleague volunteering 
and fundraising. We use the Business for Societal Impact 
(B4SI) measurement framework to define our corporate 
community investment in a clear, consistent and robust way.
Through funding our four charitable Foundations, our bold 
partnership with Crisis to increase access to high-quality 
affordable housing, delivery of financial education to children 
and young people and championing sustainability with the 
Woodland Trust, we are helping tackle social disadvantage 
and support important sustainability initiatives.
Colleague volunteering 
Our primary volunteering themes are closely aligned to 
our Group’s purpose and strategic partnerships to support 
our impact as a Group on our key focus areas to Help 
Britain Prosper. 
Our ‘Time to Make a Difference’ volunteering programme 
supports colleagues to give a minimum of eight hours a 
year within work time to volunteer. In 2024, we launched 
a brand new ‘Your Volunteering’ app for colleagues to 
ensure that their volunteering journey and the Group’s 
ability to report on engagement are both greatly enhanced. 
We encourage our colleagues to engage in skills-based 
volunteering to better serve our communities in tangible 
ways and gain valuable experiences.
This year, colleagues from across the Group took part 
in a Conservation Day with the Steyning Downland 
Scheme (SDS), to experience exactly how the Weald 
to Waves project we are supporting as part of Projects 
for Nature puts nature recovery and landscape 
connectivity into action.
Throughout 2024, 13,500 colleagues contributed more than 
86,000 hours of volunteering, utilising a wide variety of their 
skills across our purpose themes of sustainability, charitable 
foundations, financial education and housing/homelessness. 
We also encourage colleagues to claim Matched Giving, 
managed through our Foundations, against hours 
volunteered in their own time for local charities.
More information can be found about our financial 
education schools volunteering programme on page 40.
Charity partnerships
Supporting housing as a route to end homelessness
Housing provision is embedded in the Group’s purpose, as 
well as being one of the biggest challenges our society faces 
today. By aligning our charity partnership to this purpose, 
we know that we can have a much greater impact.
Currently, 242,000 families and individuals across the 
UK are experiencing the worst forms of homelessness. 
We are working with Crisis (and Simon Community in 
Northern Ireland) to help them provide the support that 
will help people to leave homelessness behind for good. 
In 2024, we announced that our partnership would be 
extended for a further two years to the end of 2026.
Since our partnership started in 2023, over £3.1 million 
has been raised with over 1,300 colleagues volunteering 
their time to support activities across the UK. Highlights 
in 2024 have included a ‘signature’ challenge trek in the 
Atlas Mountains through which 120 colleagues raised more 
than £550,000, and 2,400 colleagues raising £250,000 
through City Walks around the country.
Through our partnership, Crisis is launching Good Place 
Lettings Agency, breaking down the barriers that people 
face in accessing affordable housing. Our partnership 
is also helping people to rebuild their lives and become 
financially secure through the Changing Lives grant 
programme, supporting financial stability through access 
to further education, employment or business start-ups.
As we look forward, we’ll focus on expanding the Crisis 
Changing Lives programme and we’ll help fund Crisis’ 
frontline services across its network of nine Skylight 
centres. Through the centres, members are connected 
to a dedicated lead worker to support them with highly 
personalised care and help to find the right services 
for their situation. Please refer to page 21 for a case 
study on how Crisis is helping rebuild people’s lives.

donated to our charitable 
Foundations in 2024
Our four independent charitable Foundations 
have been providing vital support through 
partnership to small and local charities 
across the UK and Channel Islands for nearly 
40 years, helping tackle social disadvantage 
in the communities that need it most. 
The Foundations provide core funding 
alongside other forms of support to help 
people overcome complex social issues 
such as ill mental health, domestic abuse, 
addiction and homelessness. 
From their work, our Foundations share their 
insights, expertise and best practice with 
the Group to help inform our customer and 
colleague products and propositions. Our 
partnership goes much further than traditional 
funding; we share skills, time and expertise 
with the Foundations, with hundreds of 
colleagues getting involved.
In February 2024, we donated £35.2 million to 
our Foundations, up from £24.7 million in 2023. 
In the last five years, we have donated over 
£120 million. In August 2024, we donated 
an additional £500,000 specifically to help 
charities in England, Wales and Northern 
Ireland deal with the impact of civil unrest, 
which was used for emergency transport, 
food support or the provision of security as 
well as offsetting the cost of cancelled events.
Lloyds Bank Foundation 
for England and Wales 
Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and 
Wales has awarded Skills Enterprise c.£142k 
in unrestricted grants that will support it 
through to 2026. It works with vulnerable 
and marginalised people, offering digital 
and vocational skills training to help them 
develop skills, connections and confidence 
– empowering them towards stable 
employment as a way out of poverty. 
Its CEO has recently been matched with 
a Lloyds Banking Group colleague mentor 
and the charity has been connected to 
our Academy Teams who are training the 
charity staff in our Essential Digital Skills 
programme, before they can roll it out 
to their service users. 
Bank of Scotland Foundation 
Our Matched Giving Programme encourages 
colleagues to volunteer and fundraise 
for charities they care about. Each year, 
colleagues can claim up to £500 to match 
funds they’ve raised for charities and £10 per 
hour, to a maximum of £500, for charities 
where they’ve volunteered their time.
Thanks to volunteers from Lloyds Banking 
Group, Musselburgh Windsor Community 
Football Club has received an impressive 
£22,120 over the last 12 years from Bank 
of Scotland Foundation.
Allan Russell from our Insurance, Pensions 
and Investments division, one of many 
colleagues who volunteer with the club, 
commented: “What I love most about 
volunteering is being involved at a team 
level with my kids… watching them 
develop and grow.”
John Hood, Club Operations Manager, said: 
“The financial support that Bank of Scotland 
Foundation gives to charities supported 
by Lloyds Banking Group colleagues who 
volunteer is invaluable and is greatly 
appreciated by everyone.”
Lloyds Bank Foundation 
for the Channel Islands 
The Lloyds Bank Foundation for the Channel 
Islands funds, supports and champions 
charities in the Channel Islands that make 
a positive difference to the lives of people 
who are socially excluded and disadvantaged, 
enabling them to play a fuller role in the 
community.
On World Homeless Day, two Guernsey 
charities – Action for Children and Maison 
Saint Pierre – unveiled ambitious plans 
to create up to seven new training flats 
for young people at risk of homelessness. 
With over £200,000 of funding from 
Guernsey Community Foundation, Lloyds 
Bank Foundation for the Channel Islands 
and the Social Investment Fund, the new flats 
will be ready for occupation early in 2025.
The Foundation’s Executive Director, 
Jo Le Poidevin, said: “This project perfectly 
demonstrates the power of collaboration and 
community within Guernsey’s charity sector.”
Action for Children, Guernsey is currently 
supported by the Foundation through 
a two-year grant of £97,638. 
Halifax Foundation 
for Northern Ireland 
First Steps Women’s Centre, based in 
Dungannon, provides education, training 
and support to women. It offers up to 
350 places per year to women on wellbeing, 
life skills and ancillary programmes. It also 
offers a wrap-around service which includes 
an onsite crèche with bilingual staff, minibus 
transport to and from the centre and a 
counselling service.
It has received a £5,000 community grant 
from the Halifax Foundation for Northern 
Ireland towards a numeracy, literacy and 
health and wellbeing programme for 120 
women who have been suffering from 
isolation, loneliness, mental and/or physical ill 
health. Debbie said: “It was great to see the 
impact that our funding has on beneficiaries.” 
The charity was also supported by colleagues 
in 2024 through a Charity Response Forum, 
where charity leaders benefit from a problem-
solving workshop with colleagues keen to 
share their business experience.

2024 marked the start of a new 
partnership between Lloyds Banking 
Group and British Cycling, as lead 
partner for their events, social 
impact programmes and sponsor 
of Great Britain cycling team. This 
relationship is built on shared values, 
with both organisations proudly 
supporting people, businesses and 
communities across the breadth 
of the country. As such, we’re 
committing to playing an active role 
in all aspects of the sport – from 
increasing the reach of grassroot 
initiatives to supporting elite events. 
This multi-year partnership has been 
entered into with our sustainability 
objectives front of mind. Working 
in collaboration with British 
Cycling, we’ll embark on a series 
of programmes that will positively 
impact communities across the UK.

succeeded in increasing the reach 
and impact of British Cycling’s 
flagship events, the Lloyds Tour 
of Britain Men and Lloyds Tour 
of Britain Women. Research 
commissioned by British Cycling 
has shown the Tours of Britain have 
contributed a combined £27.6

audiences and having a positive 
impact on the towns and cities 
through which the Tour passes.

As the relationship with British 
Cycling grows, our work will focus 
on purpose-led programmes that 
seek to inspire participation and 
increase engagement of an activity 
that is inherently sustainable.

Our 2024 
diversity, equity 
and inclusion 
performance
A more inclusive business is a stronger business. In line with 
our Group strategy and our activity to maximise the potential 
of people, our goal is to ensure inclusion is at the heart of 
everything we do, further integrating initiatives across our 
operations, ensuring it influences every aspect of our work 
with our customers, colleagues, communities and partners. 
Our refreshed approach and plans remain centred around 
our guiding principle of Inclusive Every Day, our internal 
campaign launched in 2023. This is supported by our 
inclusion plans which we’ve developed in partnership with 
our Group Executive Allies, diverse colleague panels and 
our employee networks.
Recognising the importance of social mobility, we are 
dialling up our focus on this important topic, ensuring 
we provide equitable opportunities for all. This includes 
enhancing our understanding of our colleagues’ experiences, 
launching our new colleague network – Boost and providing 
increased support for those entering the workforce for 
the first time.
We’ve also dedicated additional time to understand 
our colleagues’ perspectives through listening sessions 
and have developed our first training programme focused 
on disability and neurodiversity. This programme is not 
only available to all our colleagues, but we have also 
created a public-facing version of our e-module to support 
businesses, organisations and individuals become more 
disability and neurodiversity confident. With the review 
complete and the groundwork in place, from 2025 we 
are taking a bold new approach to our ambitions, which 
we will achieve by 2030.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Gender
We are committed to leading the 
way on gender equality. Our focus 
is on enhancing the talent pipeline 
to achieve a gender balance in 
senior roles. 
Our commitment to gender balance is reflected in the 
steady progress we have made, with 40.4 per cent of senior 
roles held by women at the end of 2024. This is against 
the ambition we set ourselves in 2020 to achieve 50 per 
cent representation of women in senior roles by 2025. 
Our dedication to gender balance remains steadfast and 
in 2024 we refreshed our overall approach, moving to new 
ambitions that better align with our strategic ambitions.
Advancing gender balance in our 
leadership team
With our refreshed strategic ambitions and plans firmly 
at the heart of our transformation, we’re setting a new 
ambition to reach and maintain a gender balance of 
between 45-55 per cent in executive1 roles by the end 
of 2030. Setting this ambition for our leadership team 
is important in providing role modelling and inspiration 
for our colleagues and ensures more inclusive strategic 
decision making. It also supports greater innovation 
and adaptability, both vital as we continue to transform 
our business for the future.
Alongside this ambition, we will continue to focus 
on meeting the goals outlined in the FTSE Women 
Leaders Review.
Supporting women into tech and data
We know women are underrepresented in tech and 
data roles – currently women represent nearly 29 per cent of 
these positions in Lloyds Banking Group, aligning with broader 
UK market trends. As demand for these roles grows, we are 
committed to supporting gender balance in this area. 
Our Elevate Programme, designed to cultivate talented 
women up to the senior manager level in tech, data 
and security, received the prestigious Princess Royal Training 
Award from HRH The Princess Royal and City & Guilds 
in 2024. With an underrepresentation of women in tech, 
we are pleased to see that many of the women who have 
attended Elevate have experienced a positive impact 
in their career.
Growing future talent
In 2024, we continued to attract women into our tech 
and data graduate and apprenticeship roles, with women 
comprising 40 per cent of our tech and data graduates, 
and 48 per cent of our tech and data apprentices. This 
is extremely important to ensure we continue to build 
a balanced pipeline for future senior roles. 
Our Breakthrough Network
Actively championing women in our workplace, our 
Breakthrough Network aims to create a truly gender-
inclusive environment. This year, it has organised 
a robust calendar of events, collaborating with other 
networks to focus on career development, financial 
resilience, women’s health and safety and supporting 
significant observances like Menopause Awareness 
Month and International Women’s Day.
External recognition 
and achievements
We have continued to be recognised 
for our work externally in 2024, 
named in the Times Top 50 Employers 
for Gender Equality 
 for the 13th 
consecutive year and announced 
winner of the INSEAD Balance in 
Business Award for Best Strategy 
 
These accolades reflect our ongoing 
commitment to sustaining an 
inclusive and equitable workplace.
In 2024, we proudly continued our role as co-sponsors 
of the government-backed FTSE Women Leaders Review, 
achieving all the recommendations, including reaching 
40 per cent women in Board and leadership positions, 
ahead of the 2025 target date.
Lloyds Banking Group is also the highest-ranked bank in 
the FTSE 100 for ‘Women in Leadership’, advancing to 5th 
place overall in 2024 – a significant rise from 73rd in 2017.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Enabling our colleague networks helps us to support 
higher levels of engagement across our business and is 
an important factor to enabling our colleagues to thrive, 
helping us build deeper connections with the different 
communities that we serve across the UK.
We are committed to listening to our colleagues to 
better understand their experiences and track progress 
against our ambitions. Listening sessions are also crucial 
for us to ensure we understand and improve how we 
respond to social issues that impact all of our colleagues. 
External recognition
At the 2024 Ethnicity Awards 
 we were once again 
listed as one of its Top 10 Employers. We have achieved 
this every year since the launch of the awards in 2018 
and have been recognised as its overall Outstanding 
Employer three times.
Lloyds Banking Group colleagues have also been recognised 
in the INvolve Empower Role Model Lists 
 and at the 
Black British Business Awards 
 highlighting their 
contributions and leadership within the community.
Ethnicity
We are committed to building an 
inclusive society and creating an 
organisation that reflects the diverse 
community that we serve. 
We remain focused on both being representative of 
our communities that we serve and creating an inclusive 
environment. Increasing representation of colleagues 
of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic heritage remains 
challenging, but we are focused and continue to make 
progress in the right direction.
Throughout 2024, we have seen a continued increase 
in the representation of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
and Black heritage representation in senior roles. At the 
end of 2024, 12.6 per cent of senior manager positions 
were held by Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic colleagues, 
and 1.8 per cent held by Black heritage colleagues.
We continue to exceed the Parker Review recommendation 
of having at least one Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic Board 
member. For more information on our Board ethnicity see 
page 136 of the annual report and accounts 2024 
As we move into the next chapter, our new ambitions for 
2030 reflect the fluid nature of both our transformation 
and our evolving society. Grounded in UK census and 
industry benchmarking, we are moving to ranging goals 
between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent for Black heritage 
and 19 per cent and 22 per cent for Black, Asian and 
Minority Ethnic representation in executive1 roles.
We continue to be guided by the principles of our Race Action 
Plan, launched in 2020, which focuses on driving cultural 
change, improving recruitment and progression within the 
Group and actively supporting Black heritage communities 
across the UK. We are looking closely at our colleague life 
cycle and enhancing representation in key growth areas such 
as technology and data. Alongside this we’re continuing 
to upskill our workforce and leadership and are committed 
to ensuring fairness in our people policies and processes.
Upskilling colleagues and supporting with 
career progression
In 2024, we continued our Line Manager Race Education 
sessions, and are proud that around 10,000 line managers 
and leaders have been trained since launch. Additionally, 
129 colleagues joined our Career Acceleration Programme, 
which supports our Black heritage talent with their 
career aspirations. 
Growing future talent
We welcomed another cohort of Black interns from the 
10,000 Interns Foundation, with 35 students joining us 
in 2024. And 120 T-Level students, age 16–19 completed 
an 11-week paid work placement in our cyber, data, 
engineering and finance teams. 43 per cent of these 
students were of Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic heritage2.
In 2024, we also welcomed new graduates with 34 per cent 
of Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic heritage and 8 per cent 
of Black heritage. 
Our colleague networks
Our Race, Ethnicity and Cultural Heritage (REACH) network, 
Black Organisation for Leadership and Development (BOLD) 
and Faith community groups continue to support colleagues’ 
career ambitions and create an empowering environment. In 
2024, they hosted various events, discussions and activities 
to support and connect our Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
colleagues and allies, both virtually and in person. 
Building an inclusive organisation continued
Ethnicity pay gap
Continued progress has been made with the mean 
gap reducing by 2.7 percentage points to 3.0 per 
cent (April 2023 to April 2024). This is the largest 
improvement since we started reporting in 2020.

Support for colleagues and future talent
We also launched our Group-wide disability and 
neurodiversity upskill programme. Developed based on 
colleague feedback, it includes an interactive e-module, 
a toolkit and workshops for line managers, delivered 
in partnership with the Business Disability Forum. 
Colleagues with lived experience of disability and 
neurodiversity played a crucial role in shaping the design, 
content and functionality of our e-module. For the first 
time, we incorporated features such as an inbuilt text 
reader, zoom functionality, a British Sign Language 
interpreter and audio narration. This inclusive approach 
sets a new standard for future design across the Group. 
As part of our commitment to drive disability and neuro-
inclusion beyond our organisation, we also launched a 
public-facing version of the e-module which any individual, 
business owner or organisation can access here 
Following a successful pilot in 2023, we proudly continued 
to support the 10,000 Interns Foundation programme 
in 2024, welcoming 17 students with a disability or 
neurodivergent condition for eight weeks of paid work 
experience. These initiatives enrich the diversity of our 
inclusive talent programmes. 
Our Access network, which supports colleagues with 
disabilities, long-term health conditions, neurodivergent 
conditions and allies, continues to raise awareness, provide 
upskilling opportunities, support and reduce stigma. 
Within Access, we have established communities including 
a neurodiversity group and a d/Deaf Culture Club. 
In 2024, Access hosted its first Hackcess event, focused 
on driving inclusive innovation. This unique event leveraged 
the collective knowledge and lived experiences of over 
60 colleagues, aiming to improve our workplace through 
innovative and inclusive design thinking. 
We continue to create inclusive buildings and workspaces. 
Our design standards ensure that our new workspaces are 
better suited to our colleagues with neurodivergent conditions. 
This includes offering a variety of workspaces to suit differing 
work styles, minimising ambient and visual noise, optimising 
natural light, and ensuring layout and sensory consistency 
across sites. We also now have five accessible Changing 
Places facilities available for colleagues and the public, 
after opening another facility in our Leeds office. 
External recognition
In 2024, colleagues have been recognised in the global 
Enable Role Model list.
We continued to sponsor the Disability Power 100 list 
 
which celebrates the achievements of the most influential 
people with disabilities in the UK and aligns with our own 
ambitions to drive disability inclusion across society.
Upskill programme 
Since its launch in September 
2024, over 35,000 colleagues 
have completed the ‘This is Me’ 
e-module and 676 line managers 
have attended the workshop. This 
programme plays a pivotal role in 
helping us build a more disability- 
and neuro-inclusive organisation, 
driving better outcomes for our 
colleagues, customers and 
communities. We aim for 80 per 
cent of colleagues to complete 
the e-module by the end of 2025. 
Feedback has been overwhelmingly 
positive. Many have highlighted 
the accessibility of the training, 
the powerful impact of real 
colleague stories and how the 
programme has made them 
rethink how they can be more 
inclusive on a daily basis. 
“I found the training powerful and 
quite emotional. The thought of not 
being able to be your full self when 
you come to work really saddened 
me. It struck me how little thought 
I’d given to this over the years – how 
I had taken for granted the fact I feel 
comfortable being myself at work. 
It made me question whether 
I was doing enough as a leader 
to understand how my team feel 
and what role I could play.” 
Rob Cregeen, Consumer 
Relationships 
“We don’t often get the opportunity 
to discuss real lifestyle scenarios in 
a psychologically safe space and this 
workshop gave us the opportunity to 
do just that… I feel more comfortable 
and confident challenging 
conversations where I have heard 
microaggressions, and assumptions 
about others. One of the best 
workshops I have attended!”
Gill Spensley, Commercial Banking
SDG 8.5
By 2030, achieve full and productive 
employment and decent work for 
all women and men, including for 
young people and persons with 
disabilities, and equal pay for work 
of equal value.
SDG 10.2
By 2030, empower and promote 
the social, economic, and political 
inclusion of all, irrespective of age, 
sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, 
religion, or economic or other status.
Disability and neurodiversity
We aspire to be a best-in-class leader 
in disability and neuro-inclusion. 
Since launching our goal to double the representation 
of senior colleagues with disabilities in 2023, we’ve seen 
a significant uplift in the number of colleagues sharing 
their disability data – rising from 24.7 per cent in March 
2023 to 60.5 per cent at the end of 2024. Our aspiration 
is for 80 per cent of UK colleagues to have shared their 
data with us by the end of 2025. 
 
Alongside this goal, we committed to: 
•	 Making our recruitment processes more accessible 
and inclusive 
•	 Supporting career development
•	 Improving the accessibility of our workspaces 
and technology 
•	 Upskilling colleagues to reduce stigma
•	 Championing the disability community beyond 
our organisation

Sexual 
orientation  
and gender 
identity
We are committed to continually 
improving the employment experience 
for our LGBTQ+ colleagues. 
Our goal is to create a workplace where LGBTQ+ individuals 
feel comfortable and empowered to be their true selves. 
As a leading employer in this field, we recognise the 
challenges that LGBTQ+ individuals may face. We are 
committed to addressing these challenges and building 
a supportive and inclusive environment for everyone.
Support for colleagues
In 2024, we introduced comprehensive guidance to 
support colleagues who transition or change their gender 
at work. This guidance was developed in collaboration 
with colleagues from our Rainbow network, internal 
experts, legal advisers, external specialists and allies. 
It aims to assist both colleagues and their line managers, 
enhancing support for individuals on their journey and 
improving line managers’ understanding of the complexities 
involved in transitioning or changing gender identity.
This year, we’ve piloted an enhanced Employee 
Assistance Programme (EAP) specifically for our LGBTQ+ 
colleagues and allies. This initiative was launched in 
response to feedback indicating that the existing EAP 
could better address the unique challenges faced by our 
LGBTQ+ colleagues. Our pioneering service is supported 
by individuals with lived experience and specialist 
training, ensuring our colleagues are met with empathy 
and understanding.
Pride continues to be an all-year round celebration of all 
sexual orientations and gender identities. Activities peak 
in the summer with over 1,000 colleagues and their guests 
taking part in 18 external Pride events across the UK. 
Rainbow continues to play a pivotal role in supporting our 
LGBTQ+ colleagues and allies. In 2024, Rainbow ran events 
across key awareness days including Trans Awareness Week, 
Lesbian Visibility Day, Bi Visibility Day and National 
Coming Out Day. 
We also launched our series of LGBTQ+ Client Roundtable 
events, these sessions examine various challenges that 
the LGBTQ+ community faces both within organisations 
and externally. Our discussions span a range of important 
topics, including talent attraction, career pathways 
and colleague support. These are all core outputs from 
our recent My Voice colleague survey, and we believe they 
are crucial conversations to partner with our clients on.
External recognition
In 2024, colleagues have been recognised in the INvolve 
OUTstanding Role Model lists 
 and in the LGBT Great Top 
100 Gamechangers list 
 which recognises and celebrates 
LGBTQ+ talent around the world.
Building an inclusive organisation continued
Social mobility
In 2024, we’ve focused on 
understanding more about the socio-
economic diversity of our colleagues. 
We are developing a strategy aimed at removing barriers 
and ensuring that individuals from any socio-economic 
background have the opportunity to reach their full 
potential. Inclusion is core to our purpose and values and 
gives an important lens through which we view outcomes 
for customers, communities and colleagues. We recognise 
the greater focus on social mobility, and we are actively 
involved with the Progress Together group, which is focused 
on improving diversity at senior levels in financial services. 
We have an opportunity to be recognised as a leading 
organisation that removes barriers and provides 
opportunities for individuals from any socio-economic 
background to thrive. Our goal is to position social mobility 
as a golden thread that weaves through all aspects of 
representation, recognised as a key lever in achieving all 
our inclusion objectives and ambitions. We are focused on 
improving our inclusive insights to ensure they are reflective 
of our colleagues. Our aim is for 70 per cent of colleagues 
to share their socio-economic background and, in 2024, 
we made it easier for colleagues to do this by adding 
the data capture within our central people system.
Understanding our colleagues
67.3 per cent of colleagues have shared their socio-
economic background with us. Notably, 23.8 per cent of 
colleagues overall and 21.2 per cent of our senior colleagues 
come from low socio-economic backgrounds1, which 
compares favourably against other organisations as per 
the Progress Together annual benchmarking.
Launching our Social Mobility 
colleague network 
In 2024, we launched Boost, our Social Mobility network 
aimed at fostering a sense of belonging for colleagues 
from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The network 
promotes education and awareness around social mobility 
and supports colleagues in reaching their full potential, 
regardless of where they started off in life. Boost has 
collaborated with our other diverse colleague networks 
to host various events, including a Social Mobility in 
Financial Services session and supporting the National 
Mentoring Day. Boost’s two executive allies play a crucial 
role in reinforcing our commitment to social mobility, 
demonstrating leadership support, including at the 
Group Executive Committee and on the Board. 
Supporting the next generation 
In 2024, we supported young people in education from 
primary to further and higher education. Our Youth 
outreach helped over 100,000 young people develop 
essential skills and experiences to realise their potential. 
Named T Level Employer of the Year, we supported 
vocational learning for 120 students in cyber, data, 
engineering and finance; the largest placement 
provider in the UK. 
To support social mobility we extended outreach to 
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds to five 
UK regions through our partner Uptree and pioneered 
undergraduate mentoring with Zero Gravity. In 2024, 
38 per cent of our summer interns and 26 per cent 
of our graduate intake told us they have come from 
a lower socio-economic background.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Supporting our colleagues
We recognise that colleagues who can 
be their authentic selves at work are 
central to our success and delivering on 
our purpose. We want to ensure all our 
colleagues feel supported, inspired and 
motivated at Lloyds Banking Group.
Grow with purpose
Lloyds Banking Group is committed to Helping Britain 
Prosper by identifying profitable solutions to building 
a more inclusive and sustainable future for people and 
businesses in the UK.
We believe that focusing on our purpose and doing right 
by our customers, colleagues and communities will help 
us identify new areas of growth, build a more resilient and 
profitable business, and deliver higher, more sustainable 
returns for shareholders. 
Our colleagues are key in delivering the Group’s ambitious 
transformation and growth strategy, which also sets out 
a plan to be a purpose-driven business and we recognise 
our culture is a fundamental enabler of that. 
The Group’s purpose of Helping Britain Prosper is as 
important as ever and in order for us to grow our business 
in a way that delivers good outcomes for customers, 
communities and colleagues, we need to put our purpose 
at the front and centre of every decision we make. 
Throughout the year, we have been further embedding 
our purpose and values across the organisation and helping 
colleagues understand how our values guide not only the 
way we work together, but also how we make decisions. 
Our leaders play a crucial role in the cultural change. 
Following on from the senior leadership development 
programme centred around the organisational shifts we 
completed in 2023, the focus for 2024 was our vision of 
becoming a customer-focused digital leader. Once again, all 
340 senior leaders were brought together in smaller groups, 
over two days immersed in how we take a ‘customer-back’ 
approach, innovate, drive quicker and more accountable 
decision making and raise the performance bar for our 
customers. This was taken further down the organisation 
through one-day sessions with our Scale and other senior 
leaders, who collectively lead c.75 per cent of our 
colleagues. We are planning to take this further in 2025, 
as we build business unit-focused leadership plans 
for 2025.
In driving the change, leaders are supported by a 
movement of over 6,300 colleagues as ‘Catalysts’ across 
the business. Representing more than 10 per cent of our 
colleague population, these changemakers role-model our 
values and purpose, share stories and drive improvements 
by challenging the status quo and unblocking issues that 
get in the way of how we work. Our Catalysts inspire 
everyone across the Group to help us become a truly 
purpose-driven organisation.
Recognition
To create an environment of belonging, recognition is a key 
component to boost morale, increase productivity and 
foster a positive workplace culture. It helps employees feel 
valued and motivated, leading to higher job satisfaction 
and retention. 
From June 2024, recognition has gone through significant 
transformation, connecting colleagues to ‘what good looks 
like’ with our behaviours and introducing our 
transformation cards on the platform. 
From Group-wide alignment to annual awards, celebrating 
those who have had Game Changing outcomes for our 
customers, to a platform refresh, enabling our colleagues 
to have an updated experience of recognising each other.
Our upgraded platform includes:
•	 Better accessibility for more colleagues
•	 Evolved branding to align to the business and continue 
to improve the look and feel
•	 AI-powered technology to make content more relevant 
and personalised
•	 Inclusion coach to check language is inclusive and 
recommend changes if needed
Policy simplifications
Our colleagues told us that it was taking them 
too much time to find the information they needed 
on our people policies. So we’ve taken action 
and simplified our colleague policy standards and 
guidance to make it easier for colleagues to find 
what they need. We’ve reduced the amount of 
content by 60 per cent and colleagues have told 
us it’s much clearer for them to understand.
Dealbreakers
As part of this simplification we’ve created a new 
Personal Behaviours Policy standard which replaces 
the colleague conduct, disciplinary and grievance 
& harassment standards. This now includes clarity 
around behaviours we won’t tolerate and should 
all challenge. Known as our ‘Dealbreakers’ these 
clearly outline the behaviours we’ll discourage. 
They sit alongside our Values which are behaviours 
we want to encourage.

Colleague engagement
In 2024, we deepened how we listen to our colleagues to 
provide a more regular and complete picture of sentiment.
We want people to love working here. With more than 
66,000 colleagues1 working across the Group, we welcome 
their views and opinions on a range of topics to help 
us grow together.
We evolved our pulse and annual surveys by providing 
greater alignment to our strategy and purpose, which has 
made it easier to take action and address what colleagues 
have told us. Our annual survey has been rebranded 
in response to feedback and to improve the colleague 
experience. Other listening included two additional 
one-off surveys; on colleagues’ perceptions of internal 
communication channels and to understand how 
colleagues feel heard, alongside Board listening 
activities and listening focus groups on key topics.
Our annual survey was completed by 81 per cent of 
colleagues in the Group, which gave us a near-complete 
view on sentiment on our transformation journey, including 
over 190,000 comments. Engagement increased by five 
percentage points to 71 per cent and our advocacy measure 
(employee Net Promoter Score) increased by four points 
to +8. Both are robust outcomes considering the backdrop 
of high volumes and pace of change. Our line managers 
continue to be integral in building and maintaining a positive 
culture, with trust in leadership showing strong growth.
During the year, the Group communicated directly with 
colleagues detailing Group performance, changes in the 
economic and regulatory environment, and updates on 
key strategic initiatives. Meetings were held throughout 
the year between the Group and our recognised unions. 
Stakeholder engagement takes place at all levels within 
the Group and is an important part of how we are 
delivering on our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper.
The Board continues to engage both directly and indirectly 
with its stakeholders. This engagement helps to provide 
a better understanding of our colleagues’ perspective, 
and the impact the Group has on their day-to-day lives. 
Please see our annual report and accounts 2024 
 
on page 86, for additional information on how 
the Board engages with the workforce.
Freedom of association and collective 
bargaining
We support our colleagues’ rights to exercise freedom 
of association and have extensive consultation and 
collective bargaining processes in place. 
During 2024, we collectively consulted and negotiated 
with two trade unions on behalf of our UK workforce, 
that represent around 98 per cent of colleagues, and 
have engagement with the CEO and Group executives. 
An evolved approach to colleague engagement and 
collective representation will be implemented in 2025 
with the introduction of three forums to better represent 
colleagues at grades where trade union membership is low. 
Pension schemes
98 per cent of our employees participate in the Group 
pension schemes. 
Lloyds Banking Group Pensions Trustees Limited, which 
is responsible for managing the largest Group pension 
schemes, has the ambition to reduce carbon emissions 
by at least 50 per cent of its approximately £35 billion 
investments by 2030 and be net zero by 2050. 
As part of this and in response to member feedback, 
Lloyds Banking Group Pensions Trustees Limited integrated 
sustainability considerations into its investment strategy, 
allowing our colleagues in the defined contribution schemes 
to opt to participate in an ESG-aligned pension investment.

Our Group strategy
Overview
In 2023 we secured a sector-leading 
two-year pay deal with our two 
recognised unions covering both 
2024 and 2025. 
Performance management  
‘Your Best’
Colleague 
remuneration
Your Best is the way we enable 
high performance and continuous 
development. It helps everyone 
deliver brilliantly for our customers, 
communities and colleagues. 
Your Best is a framework that builds on our Group’s 
strategy, purpose and values. It helps us achieve our key 
aims of making the Group a place that people love to work, 
where people deliver for our customers and communities, 
and shape finance as a force for good. 
The year starts with goal setting, where leaders and 
managers help colleagues connect with the Group’s 
strategy. Colleagues understand how their work aligns 
to this and create focused performance goals and 
development goals to ensure they can deliver more 
for our customers and they have the relevant skills 
to be able to do this, both now and for the future.
On a day-to-day basis, colleagues are supported to 
be their best by in-the-moment feedback and coaching 
from their managers. This is a two-way dialogue as 
we encourage managers to ask regularly for feedback 
on how they are leading their teams. 
Quarterly check-ins provide the opportunity for line 
manager and colleague to talk about performance 
and development more holistically, providing clarity 
on performance to date and setting actions for the next 
90 days. Checkpoints provide a quarterly opportunity 
for management to come together to discuss colleague 
impact across the peer group, helping to provide 
challenge and check for bias, informing check-ins.
This deal has created certainty for our more junior 
colleagues who will receive a further minimum pay 
award of £1,500 pro rata and a new minimum starting 
salary of £25,000 in April 2025, a 6.3 per cent increase 
on 2024 and some 25 per cent higher than our minimum 
pay at the start of 2023. 
The Group continues to be an accredited Living Wage 
Foundation Employer with current pay rates comfortably 
above the minimums required for accreditation.
To encourage ownership, colleagues are eligible to 
participate in our HMRC-approved share plans. We also 
continued to promote our Healthy Finances Hub and 
Employee Assistance Programme to enable colleagues 
to support themselves at key personal moments.

annual report and accounts 2024

Our Group strategy
Overview
Health and wellbeing
The health and wellbeing of our 
colleagues remains a key priority for 
the Group. We use a data and values-
led strategic approach to understand 
the wellbeing needs of our people, 
along with any emerging issues and 
trends in the external environment. 
We are on an innovation journey, ensuring our wellbeing 
proposition meets the existing and emerging needs of 
colleagues as the business continues to grow, focus and 
change. Our approach continues to deliver support across 
each of our six pillars and wellbeing remains a key theme 
in our internal communications, helping colleagues to feel 
supported through the wide range of focused wellbeing 
support on offer to empower healthy and sustainable 
choices. We use colleague stories and journeys throughout 
wellbeing campaigns to make the content relatable and 
real – highlighting the context, support received and 
colleague update. 
Throughout the year, our focus on improving mental health 
has seen us deliver colleague listening and focus groups 
to better understand colleague needs, psychological 
safety workshops for managers and interactive wellbeing 
screening (kiosks) which were introduced across some 
of our key offices. Our strategy centres on directing 
our colleagues to the wellbeing support that they need 
quickly and simply using wellbeing roadshows, our 
advocates network and a refreshed communications 
approach to grow awareness and engagement. 
Colleague mental health 
At Lloyds Banking Group, the mental health and wellbeing 
of our people is our priority and we remain committed 
to creating a fully inclusive workplace where all colleagues, 
regardless of business area, contract type or geography 
are supported to thrive at work. We believe it is important 
that we are consistently challenging the stigma that exists 
around mental health and encouraging open conversations 
so that we are able to serve our customers in the best 
way we can. 
Our approach focuses on the spectrum of mental health, 
from everyday wellbeing through to clinically diagnosed 
conditions. We focus on prevention as well as support.
We use a range of data to understand the wellbeing and 
mental health of our colleagues. This includes a range 
of internal mental health and people data, mental 
health services utilisation, colleague listening and 
colleague voice to gauge the overall health, wellbeing 
and engagement of colleagues. We use that data to 
support evolution of the provision to support wellbeing 
and to create a culture around wellbeing where 
colleagues and leaders feel safe to be vulnerable and 
seek support. Colleagues make more than 120,000 visits 
per month to our internal Health, Safety & Wellbeing 
site which hosts continually renewed resources to 
support colleagues.
At the start of 2018, we increased the amount of cover 
available to colleagues through private medical benefit 
for mental health conditions (£50,000), to be equal to 
the financial support available for physical conditions and 
to create ‘parity of esteem’. Utilisation data demonstrates 
that colleagues find this increasingly helpful.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Building an inclusive organisation continued
Health and wellbeing continued
Almost 50,000 permanent and temporary Lloyds Banking 
Group colleagues learned about mental health and how 
to support others through specialist mental health online 
training and a further 2,600 have completed suicide 
prevention training.
This year, we’ve launched our new wellbeing advocates 
programme, with more than 1,500 advocates now 
onboarded and trained. This new programme places 
focus on ‘whole person wellbeing’ with understanding 
that overall wellbeing and mental health are intrinsically 
linked and should be supported. 
We provide free subscription to the market-leading 
meditation app, Headspace, to all colleagues and their 
loved ones. The app provides access to content covering 
a range of topics from stress to self-esteem. Approximately 
26,000 colleagues have registered, along with 2,500 of 
their loved ones. These initiatives continue to help us to 
change our culture around mental health, empowering our 
colleagues to openly talk about, and take ownership of, 
their own wellbeing and take action to support it. 
Private medical benefit 
All colleagues are offered private medical benefit as a 
core employee benefit, which gives access to high-quality 
medical care, including accommodation, nursing care 
and specialist advice.
In 2024, we’ve extended colleague cover to include 
neurodiversity assessment and diagnosis and worked 
with the Neurodiversity arm of our Group disability 
network to improve awareness. Our Group Disability team 
have invested heavily in building manager awareness and 
capability through our new Disability and Neurodiversity 
Manager training.
Cover is also available for family members by purchasing 
additional benefits through our benefits programme, Flex.
Menopause support 
Approximately 31 per cent of our workforce is made up of 
women aged over 40, which means many of our colleagues 
could be experiencing symptoms of perimenopause or 
menopause. We want to ensure all our people are healthy 
Pushing mental health boundaries
We continue to focus on improving colleague access to the 
right mental health support that is tailored to them and 
their individual needs. We’re undertaking market-leading 
trials with our EAP partner, testing opportunities to get 
colleagues who have certain protected characteristics 
paired directly with a counsellor who has similar relevant 
lived experience. This approach reduces friction for our 
most vulnerable colleagues and builds confidence to 
access mental health support during a time of need.
Mental health as a key component of our health and 
wellbeing strategy continues to be a focus, 
building a culture where mental health stigma is 
consistently challenged and reduced. We listen to 
colleagues, test and learn, remaining agile to further 
hone our approach and ensure all colleagues feel 
supported to be their best at work. 
Our commitment to the mental health of our colleagues 
has been Accredited ‘Excelling’ by the City Mental Health 
Alliance (CCLA) against its Thriving at Work  
Assessment.
Race and Ethnicity Mental Health  
Advocates
We collaborated with the City Mental Health Alliance 
on the mental health and race at work report, which seeks 
to build the business community’s understanding of the 
challenges faced by Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic 
employees at work and how this impacts their mental 
health. The Group has had tremendous success through its 
training and offering of colleague mental health advocates. 
By leveraging the mental health and race at work report, 
we have recruited and trained 42 race and ethnicity mental 
health advocates to support our Black, Asian and Minority 
Ethnic colleagues to discuss mental health-related issues 
and get support directly from colleagues who have lived 
similar experiences.
at work and reach their full potential. As a Menopause 
Accredited bank, we have also continued to improve 
our support for colleagues, increasing the primary care 
benefit limit from £250 to the entire £500 allowance 
for menopause-related support, so colleagues are able 
to have more conversations with a clinical expert.
We continue to challenge the stigma around menopause 
and support all our colleagues to be menopause-aware 
and informed. Our support proposition continues 
through training and awareness programmes such 
as the Menopause Promise to improve day-to-day 
experience and provide medical support through 
our Bupa private medical benefit. 
Homelessness support
As part of our commitment to the homelessness 
covenant, helping to end homelessness and Helping 
Britain Prosper, we launched support for colleagues 
facing homelessness. This focuses on helping to remove 
the stigma, with dedicated support and guidance for 
colleagues and line managers, additional flexibility 
and paid leave.

Domestic and 
economic abuse 
support
We believe employers have a very real 
role to play in supporting individuals 
who have experienced and survived, 
domestic and economic abuse. 
By raising awareness, acknowledging 
and responding to the issue, work can 
be a safe space. We continue to work 
with specialist charities including 
Surviving Economic Abuse and Tender, 
along with Employers’ Initiative on 
Domestic Abuse (EIDA) to shape and 
improve our support for colleagues. 
Providing support to colleagues 
We share regular communications to raise awareness, to 
provide the opportunity for colleagues to ask questions 
and find out more about the support available. In 2024, 
alongside our 16 Days of Action Against Domestic Abuse 
campaign, we worked with EIDA, Tender, Galop and 
Crisis, to host a series of Group-wide webinars focusing 
on topics such as young people and domestic abuse, 
domestic abuse through an LGBTQ+ lens and the 
intersection between domestic abuse and homelessness. 
Professional support to specialist charities and support 
organisations is signposted, including the Bright Sky app. 
We have specific guidance for managers on how to 
support colleagues experiencing domestic and economic 
abuse. This guidance aims to increase awareness and 
understanding of the nature and impact of abuse, to 
help them support colleagues in the workplace and 
to signpost them to access additional help from 
appropriate third parties. 
Group emergency assistance
Our established Emergency Assistance Programme 
for colleagues (and their children) covers the cost of one-
to-one support and emergency accommodation for 
14 nights. During an emergency stay, the colleague can 
receive additional support to help them with their next 
steps. We also offer to change their work mobile number 
to help prevent the perpetrator contacting them.
Sharing our experience
As our support for colleagues who are victim/survivors 
of abuse has reached maturity, we take our commitment 
to Helping Britain Prosper very seriously, and are proud 
to have become the employer member of Manchester 
Gender Based Violence Board. This is a multi-agency 
action group accountable for design and delivery of 
criminal, healthcare, education, policing and employer 
initiatives to tackle domestic and economic abuse.
For more information about how we support our 
customers who are experiencing domestic and economic 
abuse, please see page 29.
Support for our working carers
It is important to us that we care for those who care for 
others alongside managing work commitments. In 2024, 
we started collecting data to understand how many of our 
colleagues have this responsibility and how we can ensure 
they remain included and supported through:
Peer support call, communities and colleague stories 
Ongoing content and events which support colleagues 
who are working carers, physically, emotionally, financially 
and practically.
Paid access to the ‘Jointly’ care coordination app
This handy tool allows colleagues to securely capture 
and share essential information to support them when 
delivering care collaboratively with other friends, family 
members and support agencies.
Parent/Carer Hub
Support for working carers of neurodivergent children and 
adults. A hub and online community providing colleagues 
with hints, tips and links to help them to support their 
loved ones, wherever they are on their journey.
Fertility Friendly Employer
We are proud to be the first UK Bank recognised as a 
‘Fertility Friendly Employer’ by Fertility Matters in 2024. 
This achievement validates the Group’s commitment to 
supporting colleagues throughout their fertility journey, 
recognising fertility treatment can have a significant
impact on employees in the workplace.
Colleague health and safety
Ensuring a safe working environment is key to the operation 
of the Group as we are an organisation dependent on our 
people. Our Health and Safety policy statement is agreed 
by our CEO and demonstrates the commitment of the 
Group to providing a safe working environment.
In 2024, we have been developing and building our 
six key safety principles. Our key principles are formed 
around physical and psychological abuse, the safety of 
our people, providing a safe working environment, safety 
in construction, the wellbeing of our people and the 
protection of the environment. Over the next 18 months, 
everything we do will have one or more of these principles 
at the heart of the decision.
Working with partners
Crisis
In 2024, we delivered joint communications for World 
Mental Health and World Homeless Day in order to raise 
awareness of the mental health impact of being homeless. 
The campaign was linked to our charity partnership 
with Crisis and internally we delivered educational and 
fundraising-linked activities and externally we shared 
a message calling for policy makers to act, via our social 
media channels. 
Our Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) 
The EAP provides colleagues and their families (dependants 
and children age 16-23) with free confidential support 
and advice on a range of issues. It covers topics ranging 
from emotional support to very practical legal and financial 
wellbeing. The service is available 24 hours a day, 365 days 
a year, ensuring that support is always available to our 
colleagues. On average each month, 560 calls are made, 
and 303 counselling sessions take place. 
Working with Cancer Pledge
At the beginning of 2023 we became a founding signatory 
of the ‘Working with Cancer Pledge’ and are very proud 
to continue activities to improve the workplace experience 
of people that have been affected by cancer.

How we deliver
Our Group strategy
Overview
Colleague learning and development
In 2024, we significantly intensified 
our focus on developing and expanding 
our colleagues’ critical skills through 
improved learning and development 
pathways and platforms.
Skills-based organisation
A skills-based approach to how we learn, develop and 
operate is core to our business. Every role now has defined 
skills and proficiency levels, which we will continue to 
evolve with changes in job architecture, operating models 
and industry trends. We are also developing skills pathways 
to facilitate effective, targeted skill development and 
career planning for our colleagues. As we gain further 
insight into the range and depth of skills within our 
organisation, this approach will evolve to support 
workforce planning. 
Learning resources are now skill-aligned, enabling 
colleagues to self-serve and address development gaps 
using the enhanced search functionality and academies in 
Viva Learning. Development discussions are encouraged to 
focus on skills, providing both line managers and colleagues 
with clearer expectations for each role. We’ve also run a 
number of Career Roadshows to equip for skills growth 
with a variety of tools and support available, build future 
understanding on career opportunities and provide 
networking opportunities. 
Over the course of the year, we reviewed our learning 
function and expanded the role of learning partners 
to Learning and Skills partners, emphasising our focus 
on critical skill development. We transitioned from a 
functional resourcing model to a pooled model within our 
Change & Design team, allowing flexible resource allocation 
to address the highest priority activities across the Group. 
Reskilling
In 2024, our reskilling initiatives were led by an outcome 
focus; this approach ensured that our programmes were 
truly effective and beneficial for colleague development 
and strengthening the Group’s workforce skill base – making 
reskilling accessible to everyone. We have now successfully 
reskilled 145 colleagues through personalised internal 
learning pathways, resulting in moves such as customer 
advisor to software engineer. We want to support colleague 
learning and development throughout the lifecycle of their 
careers, empowering our colleagues to be adaptable in an 
ever-evolving world, with skills that are transferable and 
sustainable.
Learning platforms and academies 
This year, we have strengthened our strategic collaboration 
with Microsoft by launching Viva Learning for our colleagues. 
This integration embeds learning into the Microsoft Teams 
environment, making it easier for colleagues to identify 
skill-based learning opportunities, including those aligned 
with broader Group priorities such as sustainability, where 
we have launched a new nature training series and modern 
slavery learning to our colleagues.
Building on the success of our Data & Tech Academy, we 
have introduced new academies for various job groups 
including customer care, finance and risk. These academies 
offer curated pathways to help colleagues develop the core 
skills needed for their current and future roles. In Q4 2024, 
academies were accessed over 41,000 times, with more 
than 200,000 courses completed. We will continue to 
invest in developing these essential skills in 2025.
In the second half of 2024, we collaborated with 
Microsoft to enhance its skills offering. We involved 
508 colleagues in testing the new functionality for skills 
and learning recommendations, providing feedback 
to shape the final solution. In 2025, we will launch Skills 
in Viva to our colleagues.
Using data and AI to drive skills 
development
The development of a comprehensive suite of reports 
has empowered our Learning & Skills partners to 
offer performance consultancy to our business areas, 
strategically driving the development of their top five 
priority skills. We have created an interactive dashboard 
that allows all line managers to monitor learning 
consumption against critical skills. This tool enables 
focused development conversations, ensuring that 
learning activities add value not only to the business 
but to our colleagues’ development.
In 2024, we began investing in AI to enhance our learning 
solutions in both design and implementation. We have 
adopted a product that reduces video production time 
by up to 80 per cent and introduced a scenario-based 
practice tool that simulates real-life situations, providing 
constructive feedback to help colleagues improve their 
conversational skills. Use of AI and machine learning will 
be critical in maintaining pace and quality in the delivery 
of learning and development tools for the Group. Please 
refer to page 144 on how the Group uses AI.
Empowering our colleagues with 
digital skills
In 2024, we joined the Workforce Digital Skills Charter 
by FutureDotNow to close the digital skills gap in the 
UK workforce. With nearly 22 million working-age adults
lacking essential digital skills, it’s crucial for us to equip 
all our colleagues with these skills to support their work 
and daily life. Building a digitally capable workforce
benefits our customers, colleagues and communities.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Early careers
43%
of T Level Students are of 
Black, Asian and Minority 
Ethnic heritage
Apprenticeships and T Levels are a key 
method in supporting social mobility 
and providing opportunities that are 
accessible to people from a range of 
backgrounds. The Group is committed 
to providing alternative pathways 
to careers that are skills-based 
and sustainable.
Apprenticeships
Through our award-winning programmes we have 
continued to extend and enhance our apprenticeship 
delivery, currently offering apprenticeships in over 30 
occupational roles from Level 2 (GCSE equivalent) to Level 
7 (Master’s Degree equivalent). We typically have 1,200 
colleagues on an apprenticeship at any time and we 
welcomed 620 new apprentices this year. The programme 
recruitment also contributes to our focus on diversity with 
25 per cent of external hires coming from a Black, Asian 
or Minority Ethnic heritage and 47 per cent being women. 
2024 saw us launch several new apprenticeships including 
the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Practitioner.
T Levels 
We have continued to grow our offering to T Level students 
with 120 completing paid placements in 2024. The 
placements give the students a head start in their careers 
enabling them to be work-ready, build relevant skills and 
grow in confidence. A third of the students came from 
economically disadvantaged backgrounds and 43 per cent 
were of Black, Asian or Minority Ethnic heritage. T Levels 
provide a direct pipeline to an apprenticeship scheme and 
29 students from 2023 returned to Lloyds Banking Group 
to start a higher-level apprenticeship this year. 
Work experience programmes
The Group coordinates various work experience 
programmes for school children to engage with the 
Group. In the course of 2024, the programme achieved 
the following:
•	 Skillsbuilder – essential skills sessions to over 8,500 
students aged between 6 and 19
•	 Work experience – virtual, hybrid and on campus for 
students aged 14 years or older totalling 1,490 places
•	 Careers fairs, talks and outreach to a total audience 
to date of 19,217 students
•	 Skillsbuilder Accelerator – 12,000 students attended
My work placement really helped 
to boost my confidence because it 
taught me I can achieve anything I put 
my mind to, even if it is outside of my 
comfort zone. I learnt that my voice 
matters and it is important for me 
to speak up and give my opinion, 
even if it means disagreeing.”

Rachel: 
T Level Student 
of the Year
Rachel was a student that has now started a Level 4 
Software Engineering apprenticeship. On her placement 
she developed a chatbot that could answer questions 
about neurodiversity. Her commitment to growth 
was recognised through her winning the Lloyds 
Banking Group T Level Student of the Year award 
and to go on to be highly commended in the regional 
finals of the Apprenticeship and Skills Awards.
SDG 4.4
By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth 
and adults who have relevant skills, including technical 
and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs 
and entrepreneurship.
SDG 8.6
By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth 
not in employment, education or training.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Systems approach
The transition to net zero cannot be addressed by 
considering sectors in isolation: instead a systems approach 
is needed to create a comprehensive plan for reducing 
carbon emissions.
In 2023, we developed a new environmental sustainability 
strategy taking a systems-led approach to enable cross-
Group collaboration, and to support our understanding of 
the changes and solutions needed to enable the transition 
to net zero. Considering the transition in this context helps 
to inform the actions needed to unlock impact and progress, 
by identifying and prioritising the most material risks, 
opportunities and dependencies for the Group.
A systems-led approach supports us to consider the 
synergies and potential trade-offs between areas of the 
Group, the systems and our purpose pillars. As part 
of this approach we also consider environmental issues 
beyond climate such as nature as we recognise the 
interconnectivity, and we will continue to explore 
greater integration moving forward. 
The Group has identified systems where we believe we 
can leverage our scale and reach in the market and the 
financial services and products we offer to support the 
transition to net zero. The systems engage with where 
we live through greening the built environment, how 
we move through low carbon transport, how we farm 
through a sustainable farming and food system, and 
the energy we use through an energy transition system.
We also need to ensure we transition the broader business, 
including our supply chain, and manage our own impacts, 
to provide a foundation for our system activity and support 
progress against our net zero ambitions and targets. 
It is recognised globally that the pace of the transition 
is falling short of what is needed, and more is required 
from all parties involved. Development of technologies 
and solutions at the scale and rate needed requires 
support from government, companies and society, with 
a strong dependency on a supportive policy environment. 
These dependencies can present barriers to achieving 
a transition that limits warming to 1.5°C in line with the 
Paris Agreement and impacts our progress against our own 
ambitions and targets. However, these challenges cannot 
become a barrier to action. 
We will continue to understand and support the needs of 
our clients and customers to transition through the advice, 
financial services and products we offer including through 
our engagement with clients on Credible Transition Plans 
(see pages 85 to 87 for further information). As a Group, we 
will continue to collaborate with government, industry, our 
customers and wider society to play a role where possible 
to transition the UK. 
Through 2024, we have further developed our system 
action plans to enhance our understanding and prioritise 
actions that we can take to support our ambitions. This will 
be an ongoing activity because of the continually changing 
external environment and associated dependencies. 
Our system action plans and progress against associated 
Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) sector targets in each 
system are at varying stages. This reflects the differing 
dependencies, complexities and wider external context 
impacting each system. For more details on our transition 
plan progress see page 68, and for information on the 
activities we are undertaking for our own operations 
and supply chain see pages 69 to 76. 
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Our environmental strategy
Considering nature and a just transition
Protecting and restoring nature goes together with supporting 
the transition to a low carbon economy. We recognise that we 
have both an impact and a dependency on our natural world 
and that healthy ecosystems are a critical ally in the fight 
against climate change.
The Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was adopted 
in 2022 at COP15, and in 2024 COP16 focused on 
implementation, where a major theme was on mobilising 
resources and aligning financial flows to meet the goals and 
targets of the GBF – recognising that financial institutions 
have a key role to play in halting and reversing nature loss.
In recognition of the declining state of nature, and its 
relationship with climate change, we have been taking key 
initial steps as part of our systems approach and in line with 
the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) 
to better understand and manage our nature-related 
dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. In 2024, 
we refreshed our nature materiality assessment, using the 
updated data from Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities 
Risks and Exposure (ENCORE) released in 2024. Our 
materiality assessment forms part of the ‘Locate’ step of 
the TNFD LEAP approach and has identified which sectors 
we are lending to, and qualitatively where our potential 
exposure to nature-related risks may be, based on the 
impacts and dependencies of our clients’ economic activities. 
We acknowledge potential trade-offs and synergies between 
climate and nature and aim to fully integrate our approach 
as part of our strategy over time including as part of our 
transition planning.
From a transition to net zero perspective, we are 
continuing to work to understand and support the just 
transition impacts through our four key strategic systems. 
There is recognition that the just transition will present 
in different ways across these systems and at their 
intersections, and so initial steps have been to build 
just transition consideration into our associated target 
setting approach. 
We are also driving client and customer transitions 
through engagement and awareness across divisions 
(see pages 85 to 87 for further information on our 
Credible Transition Plans). 
Our approach aims to support our clients 
to transition, mitigate risks for the Group 
and identify opportunities for growth 
through financing and investment.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Our emissions 
reduction  
ambitions
We have set several ambitions across 
our own operations, supply chain, 
lending and investments to support 
the decarbonisation of our business 
in line with limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C. 
While we continue to make progress on our ambitions, 
there are significant challenges and external dependencies 
in many areas of the economy, including the technologies, 
solutions and policies required, that will need to be 
addressed for us to achieve these ambitions. See 
pages 69 to 124. 
Globally, we are not moving quickly enough to tackle 
the climate crisis at the speed we know is required and 
we will need to do more and collaborate with a wide range 
of stakeholders to unlock the barriers that stand in our 
way or we will not achieve our ambitions. The financial 
ecosystem provides a critical means to accelerate the low 
carbon transition, by leveraging purposeful engagement 
with policymakers, regulators, customers, clients and 
suppliers. Policy advocacy will continue to be a priority, 
shaped by the experiences of customers and clients in 
adopting energy efficiency and low carbon technologies. 
Another priority role is convening stakeholders to share 
understanding, and test and scale low carbon solutions, 
at pace.

We have obtained ISAE 3000 (revised) limited 
assurance that the selected 2030 ambitions, targets 
and pledges below, align with the temperature goal of 
Article 2(1)a of the Paris Agreement which states the 
objective as “holding the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial 
levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, 
recognising that this would significantly reduce 
the risks and impacts of climate change”:

The limited assurance includes assessment that the 
above noted ambitions and targets have been set 
at a level of emissions or emissions intensity reduction 
that is equal to or greater than the reduction required 
using the Paris-aligned scenarios and science-aligned 
methodologies as described in our sustainability 
metrics basis of reporting 2024 
 
In February 2025, the Climate Change Committee 
(CCC) is expected to publish advice to government 
on the level of the Seventh Carbon Budget and 
emission reductions required to ensure the UK is 
on the pathway to net zero by 2050. During 2025, 
we will assess the implications of the CCC’s Seventh 
Carbon Budget for our emission reduction ambitions, 
particularly for our 2030 ambition to reduce our 
bank financed emissions and for our bank Net-Zero 
Banking Alliance (NZBA) sector targets which have 
been set using the CCC’s Sixth Carbon Budget.
We continue to keep the Science-based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) criteria under review. During 2024, 
we contributed to the consultation on SBTi’s 
Financial Institution Net-Zero (FINZ) Standard.

Our Group sustainable finance and investment
In 2024, we achieved three of our four targets totalling 
£20.8 billion of sustainable financing for Energy 
Performance Certificate (EPC) A and B mortgage lending 
and financing for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid 
vehicles for retail customers, as well as achieving our 
Scottish Widows £25 billion discretionary investment 
in climate-aware strategies target. 
Looking ahead, we’ve set new three-year targets of 
£11 billion for EPC A and B mortgages and £10 billion 
for electric vehicles from 2025 to 2027. This brings 
the total amount we have committed since 2022 
to £84 billion across the Bank and up to £25 billion 
of investments in climate-aware strategies for our 
Scottish Widows business.
We have established sustainable finance and investment 
targets aligned to our core business areas. Our financing 
and investment target horizons align to the Group’s strategic 
and performance management timelines that will continue 
to build up to support our 2030 ambitions and beyond 
to 2050. Sustainable finance and investment is a key 
mechanism that can be used to support the transition 
and reduce emissions, however, global coordinated action 
is needed across financial service providers, corporates, 
government agencies and regulators to deliver against 
our net zero transition ambitions and targets.
Our Sustainable Financing Framework 
 has continued to 
evolve to provide greater clarity on what the Group considers 
to be eligible types of sustainable finance covering the Group’s 
Retail lending and Commercial Banking lending. Sustainable 
finance and investment targets continue to be part of our

Our Group strategy
Overview
Supporting nature
Our use of carbon credits
We recognise that our business 
impacts and depends on nature, 
and that supporting nature’s recovery 
is essential in climate change mitigation 
and adaptation. 
Healthy ecosystems are more resilient to climate change and 
support climate regulation, which is critical to transitioning 
the UK to a low carbon economy and Helping Britain Prosper.
As we continue our journey to embed our Nature 
Approach, we have focused on the following key activities:
Capitalising on nature-related opportunities
Across the Group we recognise the importance of nature-
related opportunities and have started on a journey to 
educate ourselves and bring our clients on the journey with 
us. An important part of this is our partnerships where we 
collaborate and learn from those working directly with 
nature such as the Soil Association (pages 78, 112 to 114), 
the Woodland Trust 
 and our support for Projects for 
Nature (page 46). We have also produced a report 
 and 
film 
 with input from the Royal Society for the Protection 
of Birds (RSPB) showcasing nature-based solutions in 
action across the UK, and the raft of positive outcomes 
these can bring for nature, climate and people.
As one of the biggest banks for UK farmers, we understand 
that our clients can play a key role in engaging in nature 
markets, and we have been exploring how we can best 
support our clients’ lending needs. Our developer and 
homebuilding clients are impacted by Biodiversity Net Gain 
(BNG), which came into effect from February 2024, and 
we anticipate seeing growing demand for support in this 
area. For more information on how we are exploring 
opportunities associated with nature markets, including 
the Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM), see page 88. 
Carbon credits, if used responsibly, can 
be an important tool in combatting 
climate change and can support the 
financing of climate-resilient 
development. 
It is important that carbon credits are deployed as part 
of science-aligned decarbonisation strategies and are 
not used as an alternative for abatement. Credits can 
be used to mitigate remaining residual emissions and can 
also support mitigation activities beyond a business’ value 
chain. These activities can help support the transition 
at the pace and scale required, including associated 
environmental and social benefits.
Our strategy remains focused on reducing emissions before 
considering the use of carbon credits. To provide clarity 
and transparency on our approach to carbon offsetting, 
we have set out a series of nine principles that the Group 
will seek to follow. We recognise that this is a fast-evolving 
market, so will revisit them regularly to consider the latest 
developments and guidance and update them if we deem 
that there is a material change needed. We have also 
obtained a second-party opinion for our principles 
from ERM CVS. You can read more about our Group 
offsetting principles and second-party opinion in our 
sustainability downloads 
 
Group use of carbon credits
Financed emissions ambition: We do not currently plan 
to use carbon credits to offset our financed emissions, 
but we will monitor and seek to contribute to emerging 
industry standards in this area as they develop. 
Own operations ambition: We will use carbon credits 
to offset residual emissions from our operations for 2030 
and beyond.
Managing nature-related risks
We refreshed our nature materiality assessment, using 
the updated data from ENCORE released in 2024. Our 
materiality assessment forms part of the ‘Locate’ step of 
the TNFD LEAP approach. In addition, we have taken initial 
steps to integrate nature in our ESG credit risk process 
throughout 2024. Further information on our approach to 
managing nature-related risks can be found on page 128. In 
line with the core disclosure metric for financial institutions 
according to TNFD recommendations, we have also mapped 
our lending activities to TNFD Priority Sectors, which are 
those sectors considered to have material nature-related 
dependencies and impacts (see pages 79 to 80). 
Our approach to governance and risk management of 
nature-related issues is further covered in the annual report 
and accounts 2024 
 on pages 50 and 88.
Embedding the consideration of nature 
in all that we do
Building on the foundations of our all-colleague 
sustainability training refresh in 2023, we launched a new 
nature training series to our colleagues during 2024 – for 
further information see page 142. We have made progress 
on our Operational Pledge for Nature and continue to 
enhance biodiversity across our key operational sites 
for the benefit of people and the natural environment. 
For further information, see page 72.
Supply chain: We do not currently plan to use carbon 
credits to offset our supply chain emissions, recognising 
that we are still in the early stages of our supplier 
engagement activity. We will continue to evolve 
and adapt our approach as we learn through our 
supplier engagement. 
Beyond value chain: We may seek to use carbon credits 
for mitigation beyond our value chain for propositions, 
customer benefit or for relevant projects that support 
wider action. 
As the VCMs scale up over the coming years, it is likely 
that parts of the Group may interact with the market. 
This will include engaging with our clients and suppliers 
to encourage them to develop their own net zero plans, 
which may involve them using carbon credits for 
offsetting residual emissions for some of their activity, 
where applicable and in line with science. See page 88.
2024 carbon credit use
Within the Group, carbon credits have been purchased 
and retired to compensate for emissions associated with 
our Tusker and GmbH businesses. Tusker was acquired 
by Lloyds Banking Group in February 2023 and 
compensates for some of the tailpipe emissions of 
all salary sacrifice cars on their schemes, the charging 
requirements from the grid for electric vehicles and their 
operational emissions. Our GmbH business compensates 
for some of the operational emissions for its German 
and Dutch operations.
Any Tusker and GmbH use of carbon credits is excluded 
from our Group reported emissions and considered 
Beyond Value Chain Mitigation (BVCM). The details 
of carbon credits retired in 2024 are located in the 
sustainability metrics datasheet 2024

Our progress 
to net zero
We recognise that ambition alone 
won’t support the transition or deliver 
on our purpose of Helping Britain 
Prosper. We need a plan to deliver 
on our strategy and how we will 
measure progress in doing so. 
Our 2024 Group climate transition plan sets out the 
steps we’ll take to reduce emissions to net zero for our 
operations, supply chain and Bank financed emissions as 
part of our strategy. Our transition plan is governed under 
the same structure and financial planning process as our 
wider environmental sustainability strategy.
We know that as much as we can achieve through our 
own activity, we cannot achieve our ambitions alone. 
Transitioning to net zero is a universal endeavour and will 
depend on key players collaborating such as government, 
industry and wider society acting together to deliver net 
zero, alongside significant technology advancements 
in high-emitting sectors.

Overview
Own
operations
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Reducing the carbon footprint of our own operations 
is a key part of our sustainability strategy. 
We have an ambition to achieve 
net zero across our own operations 
by 2030, based on our 2018/19 
baseline3. The delivery of our 
ambition is supported  
by five pledges3:
Our operating model has evolved since setting our travel 
pledge in 2021. With the Group drawing more select skills 
from the global market, we have therefore had to reassess 
our existing travel pledge commitment. The operating 
model evolution has impacted our carbon emissions through 
a need for increased international travel by our colleagues. 
From reporting year 2023/24, we have revised the elements 
reported within our travel pledge to focus on domestic 
travel only aligned with our action plans. This includes 
domestic commuting, business travel and company vehicles. 
A breakdown of our travel-related carbon emissions by 
domestic and international travel is included in the 
sustainability metrics datasheet 2024 available in our 
sustainability downloads 
 
Moving forward, we will continue to actively promote 
sustainable travel options and monitor international travel 
emissions. We commit to putting controls in place to 
minimise international emissions to an essential level.
Our actions 
While we continue to make strong progress against our 
ambition and supporting pledges, we recognise that we will 
need to keep investing in our buildings, as well as supporting 
colleagues in the transition towards a greener future.
In 2025, we will continue to deploy energy efficient 
technology including LED lighting and improved building 
controls. We will remain focused on removing all use of 
natural gas from our estate, replacing gas boilers with low 
carbon heating technologies and creating more sustainable 
branches in communities across the UK. We will keep 
investing in sustainable and active travel facilities across 
our buildings whilst building upon our initial scoping actions 
for our waste and water pledges to maintain the momentum 
of a productive inception year.
We remain a committed member of the World Green Building 
Council Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, and the 
Climate Group’s campaigns on renewable electricity (RE100), 
energy productivity (EP100) and electric vehicles (EV100).

Water neutrality by 2030
We have removed the gas from the 
heating systems of five branches, 
meaning we can utilise the carbon free 
electricity we purchase through power 
purchase agreements (PPAs). 
To strengthen our commitment to the 
procurement of 100 per cent renewable 
electricity, we signed a three-year 
corporate PPA to complement our 
longer term PPA agreed in the previous 
year. This short-term agreement will 
cover around 25 per cent of our 
electricity requirement and provides 
direct line of sight from the electricity 
produced from two onshore windfarms 
to our buildings.
Guided by our 360 framework, our 
Manchester office refurbishment and 
our Leeds relocation focused on 
delivering net zero carbon operations via 
fully electric and heat pump solutions.
We have maintained high momentum 
on our travel commitment throughout 
the year. 
Across our estate, we now offer electric 
vehicle (EV) charging to our colleagues 
at 37 of our sites. Across our entire 
portfolio, we now have 303 EV charging 
points. We have also completed active 
travel enhancements at 63 sites. 
In conjunction with Cycling UK, we 
have undertaken a commuter cycling 
behavioural change pilot at two sites 
and we have completed bike servicing 
at four hub offices.
Our lift sharing platform offered to all 
UK colleagues has over 3,150 journeys 
authenticated with dedicated parking 
offered at four sites. 
We have improved data granularity and 
enhanced business travel data reports. 
We have set up forums to support travel 
emission reduction strategies, encourage 
further behavioural change with a 
rail-first approach for the UK, and put in 
place guard rails for international travel.
To complement this work, we have 
completed a number of in-person 
sustainable travel roadshows across our 
estate to support colleagues to make 
sustainable travel choices.
Over the medium term, we will continue 
to focus on the removal of gas from 
the heating systems of our properties. 
In conjunction with this, we will 
continue to consider any building fabric 
enhancements which are available 
and appropriate to be installed. 
We aim to enhance our portfolio of 
renewable energy supply, with a focus 
on solar installations where appropriate.
We will continue to purchase renewable 
electricity through direct PPAs. Where 
this is not possible, we will utilise the 
renewable energy certificate market 
as an alternative.
We will continue enhanced travel 
reporting and engagement to ensure 
our business units prioritise sustainable 
travel.
We will continue supporting our 
colleagues to adopt sustainable 
commuting habits, for example, 
with bike servicing at key hubs and 
EV roadshows.
We will continue to improve sustainable 
travel facilities across our estate.
We will investigate technology/app 
offerings such as gamification and 
rewards for sustainable travel.
We have taken further action to 
reduce our building energy consumption. 
In 2024, we completed 60 LED 
installations across our branch network, 
bringing our total LED installations 
to over 350 branches.
We have completed either full or partial 
LED installations across 22 offices within 
our portfolio.
In 2024 we added another 49 properties 
to our connected branches programme. 
This provides a remote monitoring 
solution which enables us to utilise 
the building management technology 
to ensure our building Heating, 
ventilation and cooling (HVAC) 
is performing as required.
To ensure our buildings retain as much 
heat as possible through minimisation 
of air leakage, we have utilised a 
technology called Quattro Seal. In 2024, 
we have installed this solution in 88 
branches.
We have continued with energy 
optimisation across the estate. For 
example, we have optimised power 
usage, leveraged technology and 
implemented innovative solutions to 
reduce consumption in our data centres. 
Alongside safely decommissioning our 
older, less efficient data centres, we are 
building a new highly energy efficient 
one.
We have completed a number of initiatives 
in support of our zero waste pledge.
At Chester Cawley House, we 
implemented a rocket composter, which 
can utilise 100kg of food and garden waste 
per day, with the compost produced being 
used in the site grounds.
We selected our Bristol Harbourside office 
to be the pilot location for a number of 
test and learn initiatives. We have installed 
new recycling stations to assist colleagues 
in making the right choices when disposing 
of their waste and we’ve replaced plastic 
milk bottles with dispensers.
We implemented a technology solution 
called Trackersack which provides 
accurate information on the weight of 
waste across each of the waste streams 
as well as contamination levels. 
To ensure we consider circularity, we have 
taken action to make sure items which still 
have a use can be redistributed across our 
estate. This year, we have reused 7,024 
items of furniture saving 640,497kg 
of carbon. 
Items which are still in good working order, 
but are no longer required, are donated 
whenever possible. This year, we have 
donated 217 items with an estimated 
value of £23,224.
We have engaged with our key technology 
waste partners to discuss reporting 
requirements and their processes for 
management of technology waste.
We have taken the initial year to 
understand our water consumption 
data. Working with partner 
organisations such as our water supplier 
and facilities management companies, 
we have taken steps to enhance the 
accuracy of our consumption data 
through a Long Term No Read 
rectification programme. This will bring 
our site meter reads up to date to ensure 
that the information we receive from the 
water supplier is accurate and useful.
We have reviewed and assessed our 
trade effluent agreement to ensure it 
is accurate, up to date and reflects the 
water removal strategy at our Halifax 
Trinity Road site.
We have reviewed our automated meter 
reading provision across the portfolio 
and have taken action to move a 
selection of these meters to more 
suitable locations.
We instigated seven building audits 
within the Severn Trent water wholesale 
area. These audits highlighted that we 
are using water in an effective and 
efficient way, allowing us to use this 
data as part of our data validation 
and benchmarking exercise.
We will continue to invest in our LED 
and HVAC programmes and will combine 
these with new technological solutions 
where appropriate. 
We will continue to work with other 
organisations through our innovation 
programme to test new technologies 
and technical solutions to reduce the 
carbon impact of our buildings.
We will continue our investment in the 
deep refurbishment of our office estate 
which will include, where appropriate, 
fabric upgrades, heat pump installations 
and upgraded building controls.
We will increase the number of new 
recycling stations and coverage of the 
Trackersack solution so we can accurately 
measure changes in recycling volumes 
and contamination levels.
We will scale up the delivery of milk 
dispensers to significantly reduce the 
number of plastic milk bottles coming 
onto our estate. 
We will select sites to achieve the TRUE 
waste certification, highlighting our 
dedication to ensuring that our waste is 
used for another purpose where possible.
We will continue to work with our key 
technology waste partners to enable 
reporting of our specific waste treatment 
and recycling rates.
We will ensure that water efficient 
equipment is included within the design 
of our office and branch refurbishments, 
tackling taps, showers and toilets to 
drive down water consumption.
We will scale up our automatic meter 
reading across the portfolio to drive 
change through increased accuracy 
of data.
We will increase focus on the 
development of a water offsetting 
strategy, including guidance for its 
implementation.

Overview
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Own operations continued
Our series of lunch and learn sessions 
in collaboration with leading UK 
nature charities covered many key 
topics in nature recovery, and our 
two new colleague allotments offered 
colleagues a chance to participate 
in wildlife-friendly gardening while 
at work. 
We have also completed two further 
nature-focused outdoor colleague 
collaboration spaces. These seating 
areas have been designed around 
UK native trees, hedges and plants, 
and provide both natural outdoor 
spaces for colleagues to meet and 
collaborate, while also offering vital 
stepping-stone habitats and sources 
of food for local wildlife. Colleagues 
can also learn more about the 
importance of nature at 12 office 
sites where we have installed 
nature-interpretive signage. 
In the coming years, we will continue 
to measure and monitor our progress 
and enhance biodiversity across 
our key operational sites for the 
benefit of colleagues and the 
natural environment. This includes 
undertaking a LEAP1 assessment 
at key sites within our direct 
Update on how we are bringing nature 
closer to our people and places
operations to understand our 
operational impacts and identify 
opportunities to support nature.
Our nature enhancement activities 
will take place at our urban spaces 
and larger operational green 
spaces, where we will strive 
to boost biodiversity units2 and 
improve ecosystem health and 
ecological functions. We will also 
continue to engage colleagues 
through delivery of nature-positive 
spaces, events, hands-on 
volunteering opportunities 
and nature training.

Biodiversity units explained and measured following the UK government guidance 
In 2023, we launched our 10-year 
biodiversity enhancement 
management plans across seven 
of our key operational sites. 
These plans help us to provide 
more sustainable habitats and to 
bring nature closer to our people 
and places. We are taking action 
to encourage larger areas of 
wildflower meadows and planting 
more UK native trees and hedges. 
We also aim to extend the feeding 
season for pollinators at our sites 
by planting diverse UK native 
spring bulbs and creating more 
pollinator-friendly planting beds. 
Our actions also include continued 
enhancements to our pond 
habitats at our Cawley House 
building in Chester to help support 
an important local population 
of great crested newts. 
Colleague engagement is a vital 
aspect of our operational nature 
strategy, so this year we continued 
to offer engaging opportunities 
for colleagues to get involved 
and learn more about nature. 
We are continuing 
to enhance our

Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Our ambition
We have an ambition to reduce our supply chain 
emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, from a 2021/2022 
baseline, on a path to net zero by 2050.
Our actions
Focus remains on directly engaging suppliers who 
make the biggest contribution to our supply chain 
emissions, driving alignment with our Emerald 
Standard. Overall, in 2024 we have seen further 
supplier progress towards meeting our standard, 
greater transparency of their plans and an improving 
trend towards suppliers allocating emissions to the 
Group for the goods and services supplied.
Whilst absolute emissions have reduced compared 
to our 2022/2023 reporting period, they are five 
per cent higher than our 2021/2022 baseline year 
primarily driven by a 15 per cent increase in supplier 
spend as we grow and invest in our business. 
Encouragingly, the carbon intensity of every pound 
we spend continues to reduce, reflecting the 
transition journey our suppliers are on and the 
benefits of our supplier engagement programme. 
We recognise the significant challenges we face 
in meeting our ambition given the indirect nature 
of supply chain emissions, the drive to grow our 
business, the need for new technologies (including 
the use of AI) and policies to support achievement 
of it. We are committed to managing our demand 
for goods and services sustainably and working 
collaboratively with key suppliers with a view 
to achieving net zero. 
Reducing the emissions we generate through our 
demand for supplier goods and services is an 
integral part of our net zero transition plan.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Supply chain continued
Our supply chain emissions 
In October 2024, Comprehensive Environmental Data 
Archive (CEDA) published updated carbon factors for 
the year 2022 and in line with the Greenhouse Gas 
(GHG) Protocol, we took the decision to apply these 
retrospectively to our prior disclosures which include 
our baseline year (October 2021 to September 2022). 
We believe it is important to provide the most accurate 
view of our emissions based on available data. As a result, 
our restated emissions are lower compared to those 
previously disclosed for our baseline year and baseline year +1. 
For the latest reporting period, October 2023 to 
September 2024, emissions are calculated from supplier 
spend totalling £4.6 billion (net of VAT). This represents 
a 15 per cent increase in supplier spend compared to 
our baseline year. Emissions have also risen but at a lower 
rate of five per cent over the same period, illustrated by 
a reduction in our emissions intensity from 132tCO2e/£m 
to 121tCO2e/£m. 
An additional factor influencing the 5 per cent increase 
in emissions is a change in our supplier spend composition. 
Scope 3 category 2 (capital goods) emissions have increased 
by 125 per cent due to a 151 per cent growth in this 
expenditure compared to our baseline position, whilst 
both category 1 emissions (purchased goods and services) 
and category 2 emissions (upstream transportation & 
distribution) have decreased by 6 per cent. 
This reflects the Group’s investment in our new data centre 
and capital expenditure to maintain/transform our office 
and branch network. The calculation of our category 2 
emissions relies predominantly on CEDA factors and these 
activities are more carbon intensive. We continue to work 
with the relevant suppliers to understand their ability to 
more accurately calculate and report emissions associated 
with the Group’s spend and more broadly, progress towards 
meeting our Emerald Standard. 
 
As part of our supplier engagement activities, we continue 
to encourage our key suppliers to disclose their full scope 
of material emissions via CDP and where possible allocate 
them to the products and services they deliver to the 
Group. Since we started reporting, supplier allocated 
emissions have more than tripled with 17 per cent of our 
emissions representing 39 per cent of spend calculated using 
supplier allocated data. Obtaining supplier-specific data 
is crucial for us to improve the accuracy of our disclosure 
and to capture supplier emissions reductions over time. 
Our latest reported emissions have been subject to limited 
assurance. To maintain confidence in our restated baseline 
year emissions, these have also been subject to limited 
assurance. 
Since our last disclosure, we have also investigated the 
emissions associated with the supply chains supporting 
our Lex Autolease, Tusker and Lloyds Living businesses. 
Their supply chain emissions arise predominately from the 
purchase of vehicles and property. Further work is required 
to refine the methods and estimates used to calculate 
the associated emissions before we can disclose them. 
Importantly, we also need to better understand and 
develop our response to mitigate and reduce the carbon 
impacts from this spend over the near and long term.
Overall, we estimate there is a further c.£5.6 billion (including 
VAT) of spend which is currently not captured or disclosed in 
our reporting. Lex Autolease, Tusker and Lloyds Living third-
party spend represents c.94 per cent of the c.£5.6 billion1.

How our suppliers perform against our Emerald Standard requirements
Engagement strategy 
In 2024, we expanded the rollout of our Emerald Standard, 
engaging with 162 suppliers. These suppliers represent 
more than 80 per cent of our supply chain in-scope 
spend and emissions based on the prior year’s reporting 
(October 2022 – September 2023). 
We completed an annual review of our Emerald Standard 
which resulted in some minor revisions:
•	
Providing a supplier can submit publicly disclosed 
emissions data to us directly for their latest reporting 
period in line with our specified scope and boundaries, 
we will accept a CDP disclosure/rating on a two-yearly 
basis (rather than annual)
•	
Following changes to EcoVadis’ criteria for awarding 
medals, we ask suppliers to achieve an overall score 
of 59 or more, rather than the previous silver rating

SDG 12.6
Encourage companies, especially large and transnational 
companies, to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate 
sustainability information into their reporting cycle.
In July 2024, we held our first face-to-face Supplier 
Sustainability Summit in London. From roundtables 
to fireside chats, the objective was to share insights, 
inspire change and facilitate thought-provoking 
conversations to help tackle climate change and 
accelerate the transition to net zero. 
Over 225 attendees joined us on the day with 
over half choosing to attend additional roundtable 
sessions covering topics from green skills to the role 
of technology in sustainability. Our suppliers had the 
opportunity to engage directly with experts from the 
Group’s Green Finance team, EcoVadis, CDP and wider 
sustainability subject matter experts and to hear from 
industry specialists on emerging legislation and topics 
such as nature. We were joined by inspirational individuals 
that had successfully driven sustainability change providing 
delegates with tangible ideas for consideration in their 
own organisations.
Overall, we have seen further positive movement from 
our suppliers both in attainment of, and progress towards, 
meeting our Emerald Standard. In Q4 2024 we carried 
out a final validation of our key suppliers’ progress towards 
meeting our standard based on their 2024 CDP disclosure 
and latest EcoVadis scorecards. We are pleased to report 
that 44 suppliers were assessed as fully meeting our 
requirements. At that time, CDP had not published 
its latest ratings and therefore our assessment was 
based on our suppliers’ 2023 CDP score. 
Continuous improvement
We continue to explore opportunities to improve how 
we address sustainability in our sourcing and supplier 
management processes. 
We have simplified the ESG questions we ask as part of 
our supplier Request for Proposal activity and implemented 
internal changes that will allow us to collate better data 
about our wider managed supplier population through our 
Financial Services Supplier Qualification System (FSQS) 
process (see page 145). These changes will help us to 
understand which of our c.1,050 managed suppliers 
are aligned to our net zero ambition. 
Inspiring supplier action
Zellis provides payroll services to the Group. In 2022 
Zellis introduced its Group ESG framework focused 
on key pillars where Zellis can make the largest 
difference including an ambition to be operationally 
net carbon zero by 2027. 
The Emerald Standard approach allowed us to 
learn from an organisation much further along its 
sustainability journey. It inspired us to think beyond 
the minimum requirements. And the standards and 
metrics helped us to prioritise our own efforts and 
to evidence the commercial and strategic importance 
of ESG to our own colleagues. 
It also started us thinking about our own supply 
chain and how to collaborate with our suppliers to 
track and manage their impact. We are starting to gain 
real momentum and have the foundations to build on 
progress and achieve our 2027 ambitions. We are also 
looking beyond 2027 with the ambitious target to 
become net zero across all scopes by 2040. 
As part of this we will look to retain our Emerald 
Standard status by continuing collaboration with the 
Group to meet any evolving criteria and to learn from 
an organisation that we see as a real thought leader 
in sustainability. We feel that it has helped to build 
a stronger relationship and appreciate the opportunity 
to work together as true partners with a common goal.”
Bella Jones
Head of Sustainability and Impact at Zellis Group
The Supplier Sustainability Summit was 
informative, imaginative, focused and 
disciplined. Overall, a balanced agenda 
throughout the day with the opportunity 
to interact with a variety of vendors. Left 
feeling motivated to focus on areas we can 
update, improve and change to help us 
maintain the proactive mode we have 
towards sustainability. 
A key takeaway was how we can make 
small correctives to stay in line with Lloyds 
Banking Group and the Emerald Standard.”

 Focus
Protecting nature
Looking ahead, we recognise the increasing regulatory 
and societal interest in nature and the need to identify 
where our supply chain has a direct impact and/or 
dependency on it. Understanding where material nature 
risks exist within our supply chain is important and in 
2024 we have completed a high-level materiality 
assessment which will inform our 2025 plans.

Overview
Engagement 
strategy
We continue to partner with businesses, industry groups and 
other organisations as they increase their own capabilities and 
skills. Here are some of our current initiatives and partnerships; 
for those sectors where we have set targets, specific activity 
is covered in the relevant section of the wider report.
Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA)
As a founding member of the NZBA since April 2021, the Bank 
continues to support and implement the guidance. During 
2024, we were elected to join the NZBA Steering Group which 
oversees decision making and strategy of the Alliance. In June, 
we participated in the NZBA’s first Global Member Conference. 
During the year, we have provided input on NZBA sector 
reports including power generation and capital markets. 
Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ)
We became members of GFANZ in 2021 through our 
participation in the NZBA. In 2024 we have continued to 
engage with GFANZ, and leverage key market insights gained 
through the membership, with a continued focus of considering 
opportunities for investment into the net zero transition.
We are aware of the current external context and changes 
associated with NZBA and GFANZ. We continue to be 
members of these organisations and will engage with them 
over relevant future activity as they develop moving forward.
Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI)
The Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), launched by His 
Majesty The King when he was Prince of Wales in 2020, has 
the mission to coordinate the private sector in accelerating 
the achievement of global climate, biodiversity and the UN 
Sustainable Development Goal targets. We are an active 
member of the Financial Services Task Force, co-chairing the 
Deforestation Workstream and supporting the development 
and publication of the Environmental Crimes Financial Toolkit 
by WWF and Themis. Through the Agribusiness Transition Hub 
we delivered ‘Scaling Regenerative Farming: A Practical Guide’ 
which was published in January 2025. We also supported 
the delivery of ‘Cleantech Homes: Lower Bills, Healthier Living’ 
through the Cleantech Homes Lighthouse Project.
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials 
(PCAF)
PCAF is a global partnership of financial institutions that work 
together to develop and implement a harmonised approach 
to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
associated with their loans and investments. We joined PCAF 
in September 2020 and are also a member of the regional 
group PCAF UK. During 2024, we participated in the PCAF 
global member event at Climate Week NYC, co-facilitating 
a capacity building session on measurement of financed 
emissions for SMEs. We also became a member of the new 
working group on Securitised and Structured Products 
working to develop the PCAF Global Standard.
Aldersgate Group
Aldersgate Group is a multi-stakeholder alliance championing 
a competitive and environmentally sustainable economy 
that advocates the business case for decarbonising the UK 
economy, improving resource efficiency and investing in the 
natural environment through targeted political engagement 
and policy development. The Group joined in 2020.
Green Finance Institute (GFI)
During 2024 we worked closely with the GFI to unveil 
a ground-breaking report outlining the potential of 
innovative green finance mechanism Property Linked 
Finance (PLF), to channel billions of pounds worth of 
private investment into sustainable retrofit across the UK.
Nature partnerships
We recognise the importance of nature-based solutions and 
as such we seek to work with expert organisations in this 
space to support our clients, engage with policy makers and 
other stakeholders, to drive broader change. This includes 
our thought leadership with the RSPB as part of COP16 
activity on integrating nature-based solutions across urban 
environments and landscapes, as well as on-the-ground 
activity through our partnerships with Soil Association 
Exchange and Projects for Nature, helping us to understand 
how we can support the scaling of nature-based solutions.
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Banking activities continued
The programme is supported by 
the government and included in the 
2023 Green Finance Strategy. It is 
overseen by trade associations such 
as the British Business Bank and UK 
Finance, with implementation led 
by Icebreaker One and governance 
by an independent Delivery 
Oversight Committee.
 
This partnership represents 
a significant step towards a 
sustainable future, leveraging 
technology and collaboration 
to drive meaningful change.

Smaller businesses and the transition to net 
zero 
In 2024, Lloyds Bank joined 
Perseus, a national initiative 
aimed at automating 
sustainability reporting for SMEs 
in the UK. This partnership seeks 
to unlock green finance and 
accelerate emission reductions.
 
Around 40 member firms will 
collaborate to design the rules 
and processes for automated 
emissions reporting, enabling 
the development of products 
such as emissions calculators 
and reporting software. Research 
from the British Business Bank 
indicates that SMEs are 
responsible for nearly half of the 
UK’s business greenhouse gas 
emissions, yet only 3 per cent 
have measured their carbon footprint 
and set reduction targets1.
Perseus will transform emissions 
reporting for SMEs, allowing them 
to easily share electricity data with 
platforms. This will simplify 
sustainability reporting and give SMEs 
control over their data. For accounting 
platforms, Perseus will enhance their 
offerings, making it easier for SMEs 
to produce sustainability reports and 
receive personalised recommendations. 
Banks will benefit from access 
to reliable data, improving risk 
management and enabling better 
products and services for SME 
customers. This could also lead to 
incentives for SMEs to report and 
reduce emissions.

sectors 
 Industry
Increased climate risk drivers2
Nature-related impacts and dependencies1
Agriculture,  
forestry  
and fishing
Increased climate risk sectors: agriculture, fishing and forestry.
The agriculture sector is exposed to policy reform, increasing demands from supply 
chains and changes in consumer behaviour, alongside technological advances.
Agriculture is one of the sectors with the largest impacts and dependencies on nature. For example, 
agriculture directly contributes towards water scarcity and declining soil health. The forestry sector 
is directly dependent on water availability and can, when not managed sustainably, lead to habitat 
destruction and soil erosion. Fishing activities are dependent on healthy ecosystems, and can cause 
biodiversity loss through overexploitation and habitat destruction. 
Other  
construction
Increased climate risk sectors: housebuilders and other construction.
Risks associated with housebuilding and other construction include increased 
environmental regulation, including carbon taxes, and investor pressures and shifting 
consumer sentiment to move to alternative sustainable practices.
Construction activities are associated with high resource intensity, relying on large quantities 
of raw materials such as timber and water, the extraction of such can have significant impacts 
on natural ecosystems. Construction activities also involve significant land use changes and the 
production of substantial waste and pollution. 
Energy and  
water supply
Increased climate risk sectors: utilities.
Utilities that fail to address climate risks may face reputational damage, legal 
challenges, and increased scrutiny from investors and stakeholders.
Energy supply is a priority sector for nature as this sector has direct impacts on nature across land 
and sea use change, resource use and pollution. Water supply is highly dependent on ecosystem 
services3 that enable the provision of water of a suitable quality. Waste management services 
within this industry are most notably associated with pollution as an impact driver through the 
pollution of soils and water. 
Financial,  
business and  
other services
Increased climate risk sectors: automotive and real estate.
The majority of our lending to financial, business and other services is associated with 
automotive, specifically rental companies, which are at risk of increased regulation/
policies, as well as increasing investor pressure and shifting customer sentiment.
The majority of our lending to the financial, business and other services industry is not considered  
to have material impacts and dependencies on nature. Impacts and dependencies are associated 
with services to the sector linked to transportation (see Transport, distribution and hotels).
Manufacturing
Increased climate risk sectors: automotive, construction materials, chemicals and 
steel manufacture, food manufacture and wholesalers, general manufacturing and oil 
and gas.
Manufacturing covers a broad range of activities, with risks associated with increasing 
policy reform, pressure to reduce emissions, exposure to carbon taxes, and increased 
litigation pressure and reputational damage.
Whilst manufacturing as an industry is not a distinct nature priority sector, manufacturing activities 
can have large impacts on the natural environment through, for example, air and water pollution 
and waste generation. These activities may also be highly dependent on the availability of water 
resources and have a high resource dependency on raw materials.
Mining and  
quarrying 
Increased climate risk sectors: oil and gas.
Whilst our lending to oil and gas activities within mining and quarrying is low, the risks 
from associated activities are increasing policy reform, pressure to reduce emissions, 
exposure to carbon taxes, and increased litigation pressure and reputational damage.
Our lending to mining and quarrying activities is low; however, these activities are associated with 
impacts related to land, freshwater and ocean use change as well as pollution such as air, soil and 
water pollutants and waste generation. The industry is also associated with high dependencies on 
ecosystem services such as water supply, flood control and water purification. 
Postal and 
telecommunications
Climate risk is relatively low for this industry compared to other sectors.
The impacts of our lending to the postal and telecommunications industry is not associated with  
a nature priority sector indicating that it is not considered to have material nature-related 
dependencies and impacts.
Property  
companies
Increased climate risk sectors: real estate.
The climate risks associated with real estate are evolving energy efficiency regulations, 
which could render properties non-compliant, potentially impact property valuations 
and lead to increased affordability pressures.
The majority of our lending to property companies is not considered to have material nature-
related impacts and dependencies as this finance is primarily associated with real estate 
investment activities.
Transport,  
distribution  
and hotels
Increased climate risk sectors: automotive, industrial transport, oil and gas and 
passenger transport.
Transition risk is a key issue for the transport sector, with an increase in regulation/
policies, increased competition with new entrants alongside advances in technology, 
as well as increasing investor pressure and shifting customer sentiment.
High impacts and dependencies on nature related to our lending include, for example, the transport 
sector’s potential to significantly impact nature in ways such as the emission of greenhouse gases 
and non-greenhouse gases, water and noise pollution. Beyond transport, this industry is associated 
with consumer services, such as food and drink and retail sale of pharmaceuticals, driving impacts 
such as waste production. 
Personal  
(mortgages  
and other)
Risks associated with personal mortgages are evolving energy efficiency regulations, 
which could render properties non-compliant, potentially impact property valuations 
and lead to increased affordability pressures.
Our personal mortgages are not considered to have material direct impacts or dependencies 
on nature. Whilst upstream homebuilding (see Other construction) is associated with significant 
impacts and dependencies on nature, personal mortgages are primarily financial transactions 
related to property ownership which therefore have less of a direct influence on nature.
Lease financing  
and hire purchase
Transition risk is a key issue for the transport sector, with an increase in regulation/
policies, increased competition with new entrants alongside advances in technology, 
as well as increasing investor pressure and shifting customer sentiment. 
Lease financing and hire purchases are closely associated with the transport industry (see 
Transport, distribution and hotels).
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Banking activities continued
Exposure to customers in environmentally significant sectors
When considering our increased 
environmental sustainability risk, 
we have looked at both climate 
and nature. 
We recognise that we are earlier in our journey on nature 
than climate and therefore have initially focused on 
disclosing our exposure to sectors considered to have 
material nature-related impacts and dependencies.
This has been achieved by mapping industry codes 
provided by TNFD, for priority sectors defined in TNFD’s 
Additional Guidance for Financial Institutions1, to standard 
industrial classification (SIC) codes. The drivers behind the 
climate risk sectors and nature priority sectors are however 
potentially different.
1	
TNFD: Additional Guidance for Financial Institutions  We have used ENCORE  
as the primary source of impact and dependency information. 
2	
Increased climate risk represents lending to customers that may likely contribute 
a higher share of the Group’s financed emissions. Not all customers in these 
sectors have high emissions or are exposed to significant transition risks.

is associated with real estate investment activities, and therefore this lending 
is not associated with a nature priority sector.
9	
Real estate includes social housing and loans held via securitisation.
10	 Transport, distribution and hotels nature priority % of Group – whilst not considered 
to be associated with high climate risk, some of our lending in this industry is 
associated with, for example, consumer services such as food and drink and retail 
sale of pharmaceuticals which are associated with nature priority sectors.
11	
Personal (mortgages & other) nature priority sector % of Group – whilst climate 
risk considers the energy usage of homes associated with our personal mortgages 
as a key driver, from a nature perspective the direct influence of homeowners 
on the state of nature is considered to be low.
12	 Nature priority sectors are identified separately from increased climate risk, 
outlined on page 79.
Our lending portfolio means our 
biggest exposure to sectors at 
increased climate risk is in relation 
to our residential mortgages, real 
estate sector and agriculture.

summary
Our target summary
Based on 2023 total Group assets of £881.5 billion, 
approximately £545.4 billion of assets (excluding pension 
and investment balances) are in scope of Partnership 
for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology. 
We have calculated emissions for 96 per cent of our 
Bank assets in scope of PCAF. 
Cash is represented in our coverage as zero emissions, 
noting the PCAF standard does not have a methodology 
for cash. The table below shows the proportion of lending 
that is covered by NZBA financed emissions sector targets:

There are rounding differences between target baseline, percentage reduction and 2030 target. Targets cover on-balance sheet assets. The scope of our target has been defined within the sustainability metrics basis of reporting 2024 which is available 
in our sustainability downloads

Baselines for C&RRE, Road passenger transport, Automotive (OEMs), Aviation, Agriculture and Oil and gas have been updated due to methodology changes, revised client data and clarification of client scope 3 data. Further details on pages 89 to 114.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Our Bank 
financed 
emissions
Our scope 3 financed emissions are calculated from the 
scope 1 and 2 emissions generated from our investments 
or lending. Scope 3 (value chain) emissions are also 
calculated and reported separately. We continue to refine 
our estimates of financed emissions as we enhance our 
understanding, calculation methodologies and data. Further 
details on our calculation methodology can be found within 
the sustainability metrics basis of reporting 2024 available 
in our sustainability downloads 
 
We recognise our role in the UK economy, and the 
opportunities it creates to support the transition of our 
most carbon-intensive sectors to meet our net zero 
ambitions. In supporting the transition through direct 
financing our financed emissions may increase on 
a temporary basis. In the long term we expect that 
supporting the transition of our high carbon sector clients 
will reduce our financed emissions. For details of our Client 
Transition Plan assessment approach see pages 85 to 87.
Bank sovereign debt
Following the issuance by PCAF of sovereign debt 
methodology, we have calculated and reported financed 
emissions on our sovereign bond portfolio for the first time 
this year. These bonds are held as part of the Bank’s 
liquidity portfolio. As the balances can vary significantly 
over time and there is limited potential to influence the 
emissions of the issuing nations, these emissions are not 
included as part of the Bank financed emissions baseline 
or ambition. Estimated emissions for the period ended 
31 December 2023 are 1.9 MtCO2e. For details on sovereign 
debt emissions within Scottish Widows see page 122.
For details on economic intensity by sector please see 
the sustainability metrics datasheet 2024 available in 
our sustainability downloads

Our Group strategy
Overview
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Banking activities continued
Weighting: The Standard requires banks to report 
facilitated emissions using a 33 per cent weighting factor, 
reflecting the fact that a financial institution’s role in 
facilitating capital markets activities is different from 
its role as a lender. PCAF does however allow banks 
to additionally report facilitated emissions using 
a 100 per cent weighting. We have reported data using 
both the 33 per cent and 100 per cent weighting factors 
to be more transparent. 
Green Bonds: We have included primary green bond 
issuances, and we have attributed full emissions weighting 
to our bookrunner apportionment. 
Primary syndicated loans: The Standard only covers the 
portion of primary issuances that are sold to investors. 
Any retained portion of a syndicated loan will be on-
balance sheet, and is therefore removed from our 
facilitated amounts and instead subject to the Financed 
Emissions Standard (Part A).
Facilitated 
emissions 
PCAF published the Global GHG 
Accounting and Reporting Standard 
(Part B) (the Standard) for  facilitated 
emissions in December 2023, which 
covers a subset of capital markets 
(off-balance sheet) activities. 
In alignment with PCAF standards, we are committed 
to calculating and disclosing a baseline for our facilitated 
emissions activities that adheres to the Standard. This 
includes primary bond and syndicated loan issuances. 
Facilitated emissions differ from financed emissions 
in that they are not typically held on balance sheet, 
and the capital exposure is temporary. 
Scope of facilitated activity and key 
design choices
Category of emissions: We have calculated our facilitated 
emissions baseline related to our clients’ scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions. Given data availability, we report scope 1 and 2 
facilitated emissions separately to scope 3. 
Overall, our current facilitated emissions are small relative 
to the Group’s banking financed emissions (using both 
the 33 per cent and 100 per cent weighting). We have 
calculated our 2023 scope 1 and 2 facilitated emissions 
baseline with 100 per cent weighting to be 0.76 MtCO2e. 
This represents less than 4 per cent of the 2023 Group 
scope 1 and 2 banking financed emissions and using the 
33 per cent weighting, just 1 per cent of Group emissions. 
Further details on our calculation methodology can 
be found within the sustainability metrics basis of 
reporting 2024 in our sustainability downloads 
Primary issuances from financial institutions: Whilst 
the Standard does not explicitly state whether primary 
issuances from financial institutions should be included, 
we have opted to include them for completeness. Including 
financial institutional activities will increasingly impact 
our facilitated emissions as scope 3 emissions data 
becomes more readily available and reliable.
Setting sector reduction targets for 
facilitated emissions
We are exploring our target setting approach in relation 
to capital markets activities, which will be informed by 
materiality in the context of Lloyds Banking Group and 
the market, data and methodologies in this emerging 
area. Our facilitated emissions data is sector and deal 
concentrated with four sectors representing 66 per cent 
of scope 1 and 2 facilitated emissions for 2023. We 
acknowledge that facilitated emissions will fluctuate 
year-on-year due to: the influence of market conditions 
on deal supply and demand; emissions being calculated 
and disclosed only in the year each deal is facilitated; 
and PCAF bringing more products into scope for 
facilitated emissions (securitisations, covered bonds, 
green use of proceed bonds etc.) as and when 
calculation methodologies are made available.

Understanding our Clients’ Transition 
Plan credibility
Launched in 2023, our approach to Credible Transition 
Plans (CTP) has continued to evolve in 2024. We have 
engaged with our corporate clients to support them in 
achieving their decarbonisation ambitions and facilitate a 
real-economy transition. Our CTP approach forms a critical 
part of our broader Group transition plan, supporting our 
sector net zero targets and ambitions.
In June 2024, the IFRS Foundation3 assumed responsibility 
for the Transition Plan Taskforce’s (TPT) guidance. We 
will continue to align with industry best practice as this 
space matures and welcome increased interoperability 
in transition planning regulations and disclosures such 
as through the increased alignment between the CDP 
and EU Sustainability Reporting Standards4. We support 
the recommendation of the Transition Finance Market 
Review5 that scaling finance for transitioning entities 
can be facilitated through widespread transition planning, 
and the development of a robust ecosystem for transition 
plan assessment which will become clearer as the UK 
government consults (H1 2025) on how best to take 
forward its manifesto commitment on transition plans. 
In 2024, we expanded the number of clients for whom 
transition planning is considered in Corporate and 
Institutional Banking (CIB). We have developed a robust 
process to differentiate between clients based on emissions 
materiality and exposure to the transition to net zero.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Our approach to in-depth CTP assessments 
In 2023, we developed our CTP methodology (see 
sustainability report 2023 available in our sustainability 
downloads 
). This methodology aligns with the TPT, 
including established frameworks, standards and tools set 
out by GFANZ and NZBA (including CA100+1, TPI2, CDP, SBTi3, 
ACT4, and company publications). Clients are assessed against 
the TPT’s three pillars: Ambition, Action and Accountability. 
Initially leveraging sector-neutral guidance, we have since 
expanded it to include sector-specific guidance and guidance 
on nature, adaptation and just transition. 
We conduct an annual review of the credibility of transition 
plans for clients within our scope. Where appropriate, we hold 
engagement meetings with clients, focusing on understanding 
their transition plans and discussing any identified gaps.
Our 2024 progress:
Progress and evolution of our CTP approach
We have further progressed and evolved our approach to 
CTP, as detailed below.
•	 Completion of in-depth CTP assessments for over 100 
of our most material CIB clients (representing £14 billion 
of drawn lending)
•	 Expansion of the sectors assessed beyond oil and gas and 
power and utilities, including aviation, auto OEMs, road 
transport, manufacturing, leisure, food, drink and retail
•	 Updated the Climate Transition Risk assessments in 
our ESG Risk Tool to more closely align with the CTP 
assessment criteria, bringing our internal, more scalable 
solution in line with the latest best practice and 
standards, and providing transition risk insights for 97 
per cent of our CIB clients
•	 Development of front-line capabilities through training 
relationship managers to identify good practice in 
transition planning, and further building our team of 
experts to undertake in-depth CTP assessments and 
engage with clients on CTP
•	 Launched a nature in CTPs pilot for the food and drink 
sector and a pilot to understand credible use of carbon 
credits from the voluntary market in transition plans 
(see page 88). We will continue to align to the guidance 
that the TPT, and now IFRS, will publish on key 
transition themes
Driving impact through CTP
In 2024, we reassessed our clients in the oil & gas and 
power & utilities sectors and found that 32 per cent had 
advanced the maturity of their transition plans from 2023 
to 2024. Examples of progress include clients reporting 
their scope 3 emissions from sold products for the first 
time and setting 2050 net zero targets. We have seen 
an increasing demand from clients for support and advice 
on developing their transition plans and sustainability 
strategies. Therefore in 2025, we intend to evolve our 
formal support to meet this demand.

Assessing the Low Carbon Transition.
We have continued to embed the outcomes from CTP into 
our decision-making processes, including within our ESG 
risk management activities. Our ESG risk team provides 
specialised support to our credit risk function, ensuring that 
relevant insights from CTP are considered as part of lending 
decisions at both the transaction/client level and sector 
level where relevant. This can result in a range of potential 
actions, including further client engagement, managing 
client limits at refinancing or may impact considerations 
for new or extended lending. Understanding our clients’ 
transition plans helps us identify where they need our 
support, such as through providing finance for the 
technologies they rely on to decarbonise.
Piloting integration of nature into 
transition planning
In 2024, we launched a nature pilot for food and drink 
clients testing the incorporation of early considerations 
of nature into transition plans. We held constructive 
discussions with our clients, finding 89 per cent of 
clients included in the pilot have undertaken an initial 
assessment of nature-related issues. Nature transition 
planning continues to evolve; we will continue to 
develop integration of nature into 2025 CTP assessments.
Transition planning maturity levels are divided into: 
•	 Early stages of Credible Transition Plan development
•	 Emerging beyond early stages in development of their Credible Transition Plan
•	 Progressing well towards setting a Credible Transition Plan
•	 Leading relative to peers in development of a robust and Credible Transition Plan

Ambition
Many power companies are 
recognised as mature on 
sustainability disclosures, with 
these higher-quality disclosures 
driving stronger performance in CTP 
assessments (such as through 
setting 1.5°C science-aligned targets 
for 2030 alongside net zero targets). 
We engaged with our clients to 
understand the complexity of 
delivering their transition plans, 
finding strategies are influenced by 
the nature of clients’ asset base and 
investment opportunities within 
a highly regulated environment.
Action
Through our engagements with 
power sector clients, we’ve found 
significant inroads are being made in 
decarbonising electricity generation 
whilst scaling low carbon heating 
remains challenging. Increased 
rollout of renewable power 
generation remains a key lever. 
However, clients flag that significant 
grid upgrades are required to 
manage intermittency challenges 
alongside investment in nuclear 
generation and carbon capture to 
maintain baseload grid capacity. 
Accountability 
Engagement with power clients 
found those dedicated to renewable 
power generation are fundamentally 
aligned to the net zero transition 
and hence, often do not feel obliged 
to publish standalone transition 
plans or establish additional 
climate governance.
See pages 93 to 94 on 
decarbonising our power portfolio.
Ambition
The energy sector is at the forefront 
of the transition, with the focus of 
our engagement being to support 
accelerated adoption of non-
hydrocarbon-based power generation 
and reduce the carbon intensity of 
operations. There is a wide spectrum 
of targets within the sector, often 
driven by jurisdiction, alongside listed 
companies operating in well-regulated 
markets having the highest ambition.
Action
Despite technical and commercial 
obstacles, good progress has been 
made towards near-term scope 1 & 2 
reduction targets. Engagement with 
clients revealed key dependencies 
including requirements for energy 
security to be maintained despite 
geopolitical risk and increased public 
and private investment in renewable 
energy and associated technologies.
Accountability
Larger listed companies with the 
advanced disclosures are also those 
with strongest climate governance 
relative to smaller privately owned 
companies across the value chain.
See page 92 for details on 
decarbonising the oil and gas sector.
Ambition
Engagements with the aviation 
sector found near-term ambition 
focuses on air travel emissions 
intensity reduction whilst longer 
term net zero targets face greater 
uncertainties on delivery. 
Action
Our aviation client engagements 
found the sector has been investing 
in replacing ageing fleets with 
more efficient aircraft, supporting 
short-term emissions targets. 
Supply of sustainable aviation 
fuels (SAF) and development of 
technologies, such as electrification 
and hydrogen power flight, are 
required for the sector to reach 
net zero. We are working with 
companies across the SAF supply 
chain to support the aviation 
sector to decarbonise. 
Accountability
Aviation clients were found to have 
robust governance in place, with all 
clients assessed having board-level 
oversight over climate change policy 
and executive remuneration linked 
to climate.
See page 110 for details on 
decarbonising our aviation portfolio.

are considered as part of business strategy 
decisions, and in relevant risk processes
•	 Further development of considerations beyond 
climate (nature, just transition, adaptation) 
in CTP framework in line with industry guidance
•	 Continued engagement across industry, with 
standard setters, data providers, peers and our 
clients, striving for increasing standardisation 
in transition planning approaches to alleviate 
the reporting onus corporates face

Insights from Credible Transition Plan 
assessments
Our learnings from CTP assessments and engagements 
•	 The transition to net zero impacts all sectors. The 
availability of commercially scalable technologies and the 
requirement for a supportive regulatory environment 
determines the pace of change, resulting in maturity 
variations across sectors and jurisdictions
•	 Implementing and disclosing transition plans require 
significant resource alongside wider sustainability reporting 
requirements. Larger, listed company sustainability 
disclosures are typically detailed, whilst private companies 
often limit public disclosure granularity
•	 The landscape for corporate transition planning 
continues to evolve. There are increasing numbers of 
external transition planning assessments and analytics 
tools, and an emerging regional divergence in transition 
planning expectations. A hierarchy of data source is only 
just starting to emerge alongside an acknowledgement 
of the need to increase the interoperability and 
commonality of transition planning frameworks
As we engage with our clients, we expect increasing 
maturity with time. We support our clients through 
identifying engagement priorities based on their current 
transition planning maturity as determined by our CTP 
framework and working with them towards our client 
leadership expectations as disclosed in our sustainability 
report 2023 available in our sustainability downloads

Voluntary Carbon 
& Nature Markets 
(VCNM)
We acknowledge that both the Voluntary Carbon 
Market (VCM) and the emerging Nature Markets can 
be powerful tools for the transition, when applied 
appropriately. 
As detailed within our Credible Transition Plan 
assessment (for more information on our CTP process 
see pages 85 to 87), for a business to transition credibly, 
they need a long-term plan in place to guide their 
journey, with clear near-term and long-term targets. 
However, businesses cannot transition overnight. In the 
meantime, they will continue to have residual emissions, 
which should be reducing year-on-year, while they 
transition towards net zero. 
This is where VCM can help, by providing companies with 
the option to do something to mitigate their activity right 
now, alongside their continuing reduction efforts. They 
can do so by investing in nature-based carbon credits, 
technological carbon removals or a combination of both. 
Please see page 67 for the Group’s approach to the use 
of carbon credits.
Beyond nature-based carbon credits, we welcome the 
recent growth in engagement with Nature Markets, 
which should benefit the UK’s natural spaces. This 
follows policy frameworks such as Biodiversity Net Gain 
in England and broader initiatives like the TNFD, which 
have increased organisations’ understanding of their 
nature-related impacts and responsibilities.
Buy
Supply
Voluntary 
Carbon 
Market
The VCM provides opportunities for buyers to act 
now and invest in projects that reduce, avoid or 
remove greenhouse gases. This is especially important 
for hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy freight, 
or aviation, where alternative technologies are not 
yet accessible. Businesses can mitigate their activity 
through high-quality carbon credits (which can 
be technological based or nature based), allowing 
them to demonstrate action whilst they await 
technological advancements.
For suppliers, these markets offer 
potential new revenue streams 
that can:
i	
supplement landowners’ 
primary income sources;
ii	 enable net zero technology 
projects (such as carbon 
capture and storage) to get 
off the ground, that without 
the carbon credit revenue 
generated would not be 
economically viable; and
iii	 provide financial incentives 
for projects that support 
nature recovery by encouraging 
habitat conservation, 
restoration and sustainable 
land use.
Nature 
Markets
Nature Markets provide a mechanism for corporates 
to make investments to protect and/or restore 
nature. This could include enhancing habitats 
to aid nature recovery and support biodiversity, 
provide clean water and reduce flood risk. 
Participation in both markets helps to drive investment 
in projects that build increased resilience to the effects 
of climate change. Ensuring credible client participation 
is crucial, and we are keen to support our clients 
where appropriate. 
This year, we updated our CTP methodology to include 
more granularity on VCNM participation and how this 
aligns with credible net zero transition plans.
We are currently exploring various products and 
propositions through test and learn initiatives to 
understand how we can support our clients’ lending needs 
in these markets. For example, we supported the Manx 
Wildlife Trust to afforest an area of grassland on the Isle 
of Man and the SAX Exchange Market pilot (for more 
information on agriculture see page 113 to 114), which 
demonstrates our initial efforts in exploring credible 
participation and supporting our clients.
Read more here 
 for further information on how 
VCM can reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions, 
and direct funds to critical areas.
This project is estimated to sequester over 
3,000 tonnes of carbon over the first 50 years, 
verified by the Soil Association against the UK 
Woodland Carbon Code. We will create high-
integrity carbon credits by planting trees of 
the right species, in the right place; sequestering 
carbon and adding to the Island’s biodiversity. 
The businesses funding the project can involve 
their staff and clients in the planting and visit 
the site anytime to see the woodland develop.”

We expect these plans to continually develop as a result 
of changes to our external environment, improved insights 
and analysis. Our plans seek to support progress against 
associated sector targets and ambitions with the plans 
for each system at varying stages of maturity reflecting 
the differing dependences, complexities and wider 
external context impacting each system.
We have continued to develop system action plans, seeking 
to further understand the systems and interconnection 
between them, and support prioritisation of the actions 
that we can take in our role as a financial institution. 
In December 2024, the Group 
supported two major UK CCS 
projects, Northern Endurance 
Partnership (NEP) and Net Zero 
Teesside Power (NZT Power), as part 
of an £8 billion financing package. 
The Group acted as Mandated Lead 
Arranger, Hedge Provider, Global 
Facility Agent, Intercreditor Agent 
and Security Trustee on both 
projects, in addition to Account 
Bank on NEP. This transaction 
demonstrates our stated CIB 
growth strategy in action through 
deepening client relationship 
on a multi product basis. 
 
NEP, a collaboration between BP, 
Equinor and TotalEnergies, is a first 
of a kind CO2 transportation and 
storage product project in the UK 
which is expected to store 100 million 
tonnes of CO2 across the Teesside 
and Humber industrial regions.
 
NZT Power, a joint venture 
between BP and Equinor, involves 
the construction of an 742MW fully 
abated combined cycle gas turbine 
power plant, equivalent to the 
average annual electricity needs 
of over one million UK households, 
complete with associated carbon 
capture facilities, located in 
Teesside, UK.
 
Supported by the UK government’s 
Dispatchable Power Agreement,

System focus 
The energy transition system addresses the supply, 
generation, transmission, distribution and use of liquid, gas 
or electrical energy sources throughout society, emphasising 
the shift from high carbon sources towards a lower carbon 
integrated system. 
System interactions
The energy transition system underpins the other systems 
by supporting the substantial scaling of required energy 
provision and infrastructure crucial to enabling other 
systems to decarbonise. For example, decarbonisation 
of transport involves the electrification of vehicles, 
the development of associated infrastructure, and the 
expansion of generation capacity. Similarly, greening the 
built environment entails the adoption of low carbon 
heating and cooling solutions. These system interactions 
are illustrated in the diagram to the right. Identifying 
the synergies across systems is key to effective execution 
through consideration of risks, opportunities and 
dependencies for the Group, something that we 
will continue to develop throughout 2025.
The energy transition also has a key role to play in ensuring 
a just transition, providing affordable solutions for all and 
equitably redistributing opportunities and growth across 
the UK, building on our regional development approach, 
and in support of industrial clusters. 
While supporting decarbonisation of society, the energy 
system also has direct and indirect impacts on nature 
across land and sea use change and pollution. Reducing 
existing impacts from energy generation and use, while 
minimising any new potential impacts, is key to success 
and links across other systems. For example, use of land for 
wind and solar power, avoiding potential impacts through 
consideration of design and location, or the use of key 
resources like water and raw materials.

System challenges 
The supply of energy is central to our society and plays 
a critical role in providing energy security to the UK and 
aiding other sectors to decarbonise. Decarbonisation 
of energy is dependent on facilitating a transition that 
includes having sufficient renewable energy and network 
capacity, adequate generation flexibility and storage, 
and reductions in fossil fuel extraction over time. Policies 
to aid reduction are further developed than in most 
sectors, but still have several delivery risks with additional 
grid connection a priority dependency, which needs to 
be addressed alongside necessary planning reforms.
A further challenge is presented by the readiness of the 
technologies needed to be developed and deployed at 
the scale required. Some are more mature such as onshore 
wind, offshore wind and solar. There are more mature 
technologies requiring delivery at scale within a successful 
business model, such as electrification of passenger 
transport or domestic heating. While other technologies 
are moving from pilot stage to scaled delivery, examples 
include carbon capture and storage; hydrogen production, 
transport and storage; sustainable aviation fuel; and 
battery storage technologies. This can present challenges 
around more nascent business models, revenue streams 
and uptake, impacting the bankability and scalability 
of technologies.
Our actions 
Our predominantly retail-focused banking activities 
means we do not have significant exposure to the oil 
and gas sector. Our strategy focuses on supporting a 
clean energy future for the UK, benefitting households, 
businesses and communities across the country. We are 
supporting investment in established clean technologies 
(such as wind and solar), while also identifying key 
maturing and emerging technologies vital for future 
decarbonisation and how to increase their bankability 
to unlock financing at scale.
Our oil and gas portfolio has reduced significantly in 
recent years, and we have set an NZBA-aligned absolute 
reduction target for oil and gas focusing on specific 
activity (see page 92). Our remaining oil and gas 
exposure now accounts for just 0.1 per cent (see 
page 80) of our Bank total exposure, a reduction of 
c.70 per cent since 2022, building on the direction set 
in previous years. This clear trajectory is underpinned 
by our strategy of supporting key clients in their net 
zero transition. Our remaining, limited exposure is 
with clients we plan to continue to support with 
their transitions, including through development of our 
Credible Transition Plans approach (for further details 
see pages 85 to 87). Given our low exposure, a handful 
of transactions may cause year-on-year fluctuations in 
our total exposure going forward and should be viewed 
in this wider context.
Government policy will be a critical enabler of success 
and dependency for our energy transition activities. 
The UK government has made positive progress with 
its Clean Power 2030 Action Plan and we will continue 
to share market insights from client interactions that 
help ensure policies are aligned with industry needs 
and can effectively mobilise capital into critical sectors 
for the transition. We will also follow energy policy 
developments in other regions where we operate 
as we recognise that there will be emerging 
regional differences. 
Our net zero origination programme, which started in 2021, 
continues to enhance our internal capabilities to consider 
maturing and emerging technologies, leveraging the 
International Energy Agency’s Clean Energy Technology 
Guide and Technologies Readiness Scale to identify focus 
areas. 85 technologies were assessed which resulted in 
a focus on 10 maturing or emerging commercially viable 
technologies, which we are actively seeking to support 
over the short to medium term. A key example being our 
support in December 2024 for Net Zero Teesside Power, 
which aims to be the world’s first gas-fired power station 
with carbon capture and storage, providing flexible, low 
carbon power to the UK grid. For less mature technologies 
or first-of-their-kind initiatives, we will actively explore 
opportunities to work with industry and government 
stakeholders on viable business models, such as long-term 
revenue mechanisms that improve bankability and 
scalability of technologies, selecting the most viable 
projects and capturing learnings as projects develop.
As part of our efforts to increase support for net zero 
and transition technologies we continued our Net Zero 
Technologies upskilling programme in partnership with 
the University of Edinburgh. This programme was designed 
to provide the latest commercial understanding of priority 
technologies and their ‘bankability’ and enhance the 
capacity of second and third line teams to review financing 
of these technologies. Bringing the latest thinking on 
transition technologies to key internal stakeholders and 
wider colleagues across the Bank helps to provide the 
depth of knowledge necessary to facilitate banking 
of new, emerging and maturing technologies.

Transition plan by system continued
Target
Reduce absolute drawn financed emissions (scope 1, 2 
and 3) by 50 per cent by 2030 from a baseline of 
6.4MtCO2e in 2019 to 3.2MtCO2e in 2030, based 
on the IEA NZE scenario1.
In our oil and gas portfolio we originally set a target 
to reduce absolute emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 
to 3.9MtCO2e from a baseline of 7.8MtCO2e in 2019. 
The 2019 portfolio baseline, and emissions reported for 
each year thereafter, were restated during the reporting 
period, and emissions have decreased by c.18 per cent 
against this baseline, to 6.4MtCO2e. Reductions were 
driven primarily due to updates made to a client’s scope 
3 emissions data during the year, impacting the baseline 
and subsequent reporting periods. As a result, alignment 
to the same 1.5°C scenario pathway requires a 50 per cent 
reduction to 3.2MtCO2e in the same period.
Oil and gas
The oil and gas sector plays 
an important role in providing 
energy security to the UK and 
its decarbonisation is critical to 
limiting global warming to 1.5ºC.
See pages 90 to 91 for details of this system.

For our absolute targets we display the forward looking year on year reduction 
required from the Scenario Pathway as our Reference Pathway, as the scale 
required for the country or global level Scenario Pathway would make our 
reference pathway unreadable.
Progress update
At year-end 2023, we had reduced financed emissions 
by c.70 per cent from the 2019 baseline of 6.4MtCO2e, 
reaching 2.0MtCO2e, driven by both a reduction in drawn 
balances and a reduction in reported client emissions. 
We continue to strategically refinance our portfolio 
away from direct financing of oil and gas projects 
towards transition technologies including renewable 
energy generation.
Risks and dependencies
Key dependencies for this sector include the requirement 
for energy security to be maintained despite geopolitical 
risk; and for increased public and private investment in 
renewable energy and associated technologies. In that 
context, our focus is on supporting our clients to accelerate 
the adoption of non-hydrocarbon-based power generation 
and reduce the carbon intensity of their operations.
Engagement strategy
As part of our commitment to supporting the transition 
to a more sustainable, low carbon economy, we are 
engaging with existing clients to support them to establish 
credible and impactful transition plans. In 2023, we 
undertook initial CTP assessments across our full portfolio 
of large-scale oil and gas-producing clients and continued 
to engage with clients throughout 2024. Details of the 
Credible Transition Plan assessment approach is described 
on pages 85 to 87.

Reference pathway
The IEA report ‘Net Zero by 2050 – A Roadmap 
for the Global Energy Sector’ is clear that no new 
oil and natural gas fields approved after 2021 are 
needed to maintain a Paris-aligned decarbonisation 
pathway to net zero.
As such we will not provide direct financing (either 
via project finance, or reserve-based lending) of new 
greenfield oil and gas developments (fields which did 
not receive Oil and Gas Authority approval before 
the end of 2021). We will only provide financing to 
new clients in the oil and gas sector if it is for viable 
projects into renewable energies and transition 
technologies, and clients have Credible Transition 
Plans at the point of onboarding. We regularly 
review our financing appetite, and our latest position 
is detailed in our external sector statements which 
is available in our sustainability downloads

Target
We have set a target to reduce emissions intensity (scope 1 
and 2) by 81 per cent by 2030 from a baseline of 276gCO2e/
kWh in 2020 to 53gCO2e/kWh by 2030, based on the IEA 
NZE scenario. 
Power
Companies in the power sector 
generate electricity from fossil fuels, 
nuclear or renewable sources. 
Scale-up of low carbon electricity generation is critical 
to enable other sectors to transition e.g. supporting 
electrification of heating and transport. In 2024, wind 
became the largest source of electricity generation for 
the first time, accounting for 30 per cent. Additionally, 
for the first time, renewables generated over 50 per cent 
of our electricity for four consecutive quarters1.

Engagement strategy
We have engaged with clients on their transition to 
net zero, including an expectation that clients’ carbon 
reduction goals will be aligned with scenarios limiting 
global warming to no more than 1.5°C and will not over-
rely on offsetting to achieve their target (i.e. beyond 
‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions). In 2023, we completed 
the initial CTP assessments for our clients in the power 
and utilities sector. See pages 85 to 87 for further details 
on our CTP assessments.
We will require existing clients in the power sector to 
demonstrate they are transitioning to net zero and we 
will provide no new lending/renewal of limits to clients 
unable to evidence this by the end of 2025. As part of our 
Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) commitments, we 
no longer provide financing to clients that have an annual 
revenue greater than 20 per cent derived from thermal coal 
generation and we aim to exit any remaining client which 
operates thermal coal facilities outside the UK by 2030.

Reference pathway
We aim to play a leading role in financing 
the decarbonisation of the power sector 
this decade, including financing solar, carbon 
capture, onshore and offshore wind and other 
low carbon technologies.
Progress update
At year-end 2023, we had reduced the emissions intensity 
of our power portfolio by 80 per cent from the 2020 
baseline of 276gCO2e/kWh, reaching 54gCO2e/kWh. The 
reduction in intensity between 2020 and 2023 is driven by 
reduction in exposure to higher intensity projects or clients 
coupled with increased lending to renewable projects. 
Risks and dependencies
Government policies in UK and Europe remain a key 
dependency, as they drive the forward strategies of our 
clients. In December 2024, the government published 
‘Clean Power 2030 Action Plan’ which outlines the focuses 
on transforming the UK’s energy sector by investing in 
a variety of clean energy sources and setting ambitious 
targets for technologies including offshore and onshore 
wind, solar and nuclear. Energy is central to the European 
Union’s transition towards climate neutrality by 2050, 
in line with the European Green Deal. We expect policies 
to support the growth and investment in renewables 
and other technologies to facilitate the decarbonisation 
of energy production. At the same time, energy security 
remains a high priority. Delivery risks should not be 
underestimated. These include competition for 
transactions, supply chain risks, availability and 
affordability of critical components/metals and availability 
of skilled resources. Alongside this, retrofitting of grid 
improvements to enable flexibility and interconnections 
will also be crucial.

Thermal coal
We recognise the urgent need for the 
global transition away from thermal 
coal to renewable energy sources. 
Keeping the Paris Agreement alive 
means that use of unabated coal 
power must be phased out.
The UK government’s definition of ‘unabated coal’ power 
generation refers to when technologies, such as carbon 
capture and storage, which can mitigate emissions 
from coal, are not in use. In November 2021, we joined 
the PPCA, a coalition of national and sub-national 
governments, businesses and organisations working 
to advance the transition from unabated coal power 
generation to clean energy.
Our direct lending activity complies with the PPCA 
principles and we have committed to a full exit by 2030 
from all diversified energy entities that generate energy 
from thermal coal and diversified mining entities that 
operate thermal coal facilities. We do not provide insurance 
for the power industry and we do not have policies in place 
for advisory services or underwriting activity that cover 
PPCA-related activity.
Target
Full exit by 2030 from all diversified energy entities that 
generate energy from thermal coal and diversified mining 
entities that operate thermal coal facilities.

BSR is a leading renewables energy 
developer with a fully integrated 
platform, taking sites through 
development, construction and 
into operation. BSR was acquired 
by ICG Infrastructure in July 2022, 
and since then, ICG Infrastructure 
has helped support the growth of 
BSR alongside the management 
team.
 
In June 2024, BSR closed its first 
portfolio financing, putting in 
place a £54 million Capex Facility, 
with the Group acting as 
Mandated Lead Arranger, Hedge 
Provider, Agent and Security 
Trustee. This portfolio is part 
of BSR’s extensive pipeline of 
solar PV and battery energy 
storage systems (BESS) projects 
that BSR will deliver, build, own 
and operate. As well as being 
a developer, long-term owner 
and engineering, procurement 
and construction contractor, 
BSR will deliver operations 
and maintenance and asset 
management to the projects.
 
The portfolio comprises five 
(124MW), built or in build co-
located solar, BESS and standalone 
solar assets in the UK and 
Australia, with a combined solar 
generation of 132GWh annually, 
capable of providing enough 
energy for over 30,000 households. 
The assets will benefit from 
contracted revenues earned 
from Contracts for Difference, 
utility and corporate Power 
Purchase Agreements.
BSR’s Michael Ozersky, CIO, 
commented: “I’m very proud 
of this significant milestone 
as we continue to grow, build 
long-term relationships with key 
stakeholders and create value 
for our shareholders.”
 
ICG’s Paul Leveque, Associate 
Director, Infrastructure Equity, 
commented: “We are thrilled 
to see BSR secure a new 
debt facility to support the 
development of renewable 
projects across UK and 
Australia. As the majority 
shareholder, we are proud to 
be part of the energy transition 
and support their efforts 
towards a sustainable future”
 
James Taylor, Head of 
Infrastructure and Project 
Finance at Lloyds Bank, said: 
“We’re pleased to build on 
our strong relationship with ICG, 
and proud to support British 
Solar Renewables with a 
financing platform to unlock 
their pipeline of renewable 
assets. We’re impressed by BSR’s 
commitment to contribute to 
the UK’s transition to net zero; 
their aims align perfectly with 
ours, and we look forward to 
strengthening our partnership 
with them at this exciting point 
in their journey.”
Implementation 
strategy
In 2023, we successfully met our target of a full 
exit of thermal coal power in the UK and we no 
longer provide direct lending to clients that operate 
UK coal-fired power stations. This demonstrates good 
progress towards our target of exiting all diversified 
energy entities that generate energy from thermal 
coal by the end of 2030.
To aid achievement of our remaining targets, we will 
not provide finance to diversified mining entities that 
do not have a commitment to phase out all remaining 
thermal coal mining by 2030 and diversified energy 
entities that do not have a commitment to phase out 
all remaining thermal coal generation by end of 2030.
We may provide finance to entities towards 
reducing their thermal coal portfolio (including 
decommissioning facilities or retrofitting of existing 
facilities to help them transition away from thermal 
coal), in line with our 2030 phase-out timelines noted 
above. However, we will not directly finance retrofit 
activities that prolong the life of existing thermal 
coal facilities. 
We will continue to prioritise renewable energy 
alternatives over traditional, carbon intensive methods.
Additional restrictions on thermal coal financing are 
outlined in our external sector statements, which

System focus 
The built environment is a material and complex system 
that includes residential owner-occupied, buy-to-let 
landlords, housebuilders, social housing and commercial 
real estate clients that have both residential and non-
residential properties in their portfolio. We aim to 
accelerate our financed participation in the construction, 
retrofit and operation of the UK’s residential and 
commercial buildings towards net zero, and materially 
enhance resilience against the physical impacts of 
climate change.
Given the size of the challenge to the UK this is a multi-year
ambition, with retrofit the primary focus as well as energy 
efficient new builds. 
System interactions
The energy system is intrinsically linked to decarbonisation 
of the built environment with decarbonisation of 
electricity, both onsite and via the grid, a critical enabler 
alongside a switch away from gas boilers to lower carbon 
heating alternatives such as heat pumps to tackle the share 
of building emissions associated with non-renewable 
heating. There are also strong interactions with nature 
for example through the UK government Biodiversity Net 
Gain (BNG) requirements. We continue to enhance our 
understanding of the material impacts and dependencies 
in this system. There are further interactions with our 
broader sustainability focus area of supporting access 
to quality and affordable housing (see page 22). 
System challenges 
80 per cent of buildings in the UK which will be occupied in 
2050 already exist5, making the retrofit challenge a priority 
to achieve net zero. As such, the most significant external 
dependencies on policy are centred on the need to improve 
the economics of retrofit to drive its uptake across all 
customers at scale. In addition, there is a need for robust 
low carbon standards for new builds to avoid future 
emissions and the need for further retrofit to address 
these. There are further challenges to consider around 
consumer behaviour and an adequate supply chain, 
including the need for a skilled workforce to support 
retrofit at scale.
These challenges are reflected in the CCC July 2024 
Progress Report showing a lack of progress for heat pump 
installations and energy efficiency measures uptake, which 
our sector targets have significant dependence upon. It is 
worth noting that there have been positive policy signals 
already announced from the new government, including 
increased funding for specific retrofits and minimum EPC 
standards for private and social rented homes. These will 
support the transition to net zero including a focus on 
supporting low-income households and the private rented 
sector as part of this, which links closely to our mission

Progress against CCC policy recommendations
Progress against key policy 
recommendations from the CCC, which 
are the most material dependencies in our 
emission reduction strategies, show limited 
progress and are summarised below.
Our actions 
To date, our key areas of focus have 
included providing tools to educate our 
customers on the benefits of transitioning 
and providing them with incentives and 
support to do so via partnerships, products 
and propositions. We have also been 
engaging on policy developments. 
Moving forward we seek to enhance and build on this 
activity by utilising the insights gained to date to 
support the development of future activity, with 
prioritised areas of focus as below:
01
Continuing to enhance our data capability 
across the built environment, supporting activity 
across commercial and residential properties 
and infrastructure, and supporting buildings  
within our Agriculture system. This will enable 
a more detailed understanding of risks and 
impacts across the system to target actions 
more effectively.
02
Identifying new finance models to support 
customers and make retrofit more affordable 
over the long term, learning from and building  
on our existing propositions and wider industry 
activity such as the £500 million National 
Wealth Fund guarantee for social housing.
03
Enhancing customer education that supports 
customers in understanding options available  
to make properties more efficient. 
04
Encouraging the development of policy  
framework to facilitate retrofit at scale. This 
is a critical focus to unlock the progress needed. 
05
Unlocking skills through our participation in 
industry-leading skills and diversity initiatives  
(see page 23 for more detail) as current skills and 
capabilities are nationally insufficient to deliver 
retrofit and new build at the scale required.

To achieve the UK’s commitment 
to net zero by 2050, decarbonising 
buildings is key.
Buildings are among the UK’s largest sources of emissions, 
highlighting the urgent need to improve the energy 
efficiency of the nation’s housing stock. The UK faces 
significant challenges, including the need to modernise 
some of the oldest and least insulated homes in Europe, 
all while grappling with rising energy costs. 
As the UK’s largest mortgage lender, we recognise our 
unique role in guiding customers towards a net zero future. 
By educating our customers on energy efficiency and aiding 
in emission reduction, we can make significant strides. 
As outlined in the systems interactions section on page 95 
achieving net zero is a collective endeavour. Collaboration 
with the government, other financial institutions and 
industry is crucial to unlocking this potential.
41%
UK residential mortgages emissions 
intensity reduction (kgCO2e/m2) 
between 2020 and 2030
Target
In 2022 we published a UK Climate Change Committee 
Balanced Net Zero Pathway (CCC BNZP)-aligned target, 
requiring a 41 per cent reduction in financed emissions 
intensity by 2030 (against a 2020 baseline – scope 1 and 2 
emissions). This equates to 28kgCO2/m2 by 2030, down 
from 46kgCO2/m2 in 2020.
Progress update
In 2023, the financed emissions intensity of our 
mortgage portfolio reduced c.3 per cent compared to 
2022. However, this fell short of our reference pathway 
expectation by approximately 1 per cent. It’s important 
to note that the decarbonisation of the mortgage portfolio 
in line with the CCC BNZP scenario is heavily reliant on 
significant external changes and policy intervention, such 
as grid decarbonisation. Without these factors, our capacity 
to reduced financed emissions remains constrained.

In July 2024, we expanded our 
partnership with Effective Home to 
include loft and cavity wall insulation. 
This addition complements our 
existing solar panel partnership 
with Effective Home and our heat 
pump partnership with Octopus. 
By collaborating with accredited 
installers, we aim to remove the 
barrier of finding trusted suppliers 
for customers. This partnership 
expands our retrofit offerings, 
providing a more comprehensive 
solution for homes decarbonisation. 
Through our Halifax Green Living 
Hub and Lloyds Eco Home Hub, 
customers can fill out Effective 
Home’s online form to determine 
eligibility for insulation. Effective 
Home will also check for grant 
funding eligibility, before proceeding 
to the survey stage. Loft insulation 
suitability can be assessed remotely, 
while cavity wall insulation requires 
an in-person visit. A personalised plan 
detailing the installation approach 
and cost is then produced. For those 
who proceed, an in-person technical 
survey is conducted, and Effective 
Home arranges the installation, 
which can be completed within one 
working day. Effective Home also 
assists customers with registering 
insulation with Quality Mark.
Energy bill savings from insulation 
measures depend on the home 
and insulation type. For example, 
topping up a partially insulated 
loft with 270mm of loft insulation 
could save up to £270 and 700kg 
of carbon dioxide annually. 
Insulation can also help maintain 
a comfortable temperature year-
round, making houses cooler in 
the summer and warmer in winter. 
Customers who install insulation 
via the Group and Effective Home 
scheme will be eligible for the 
government grant finder service. 
Additionally, eligible Halifax and 
Lloyds mortgage customers can 
access £500 cashback towards 
the cost through our existing Green 
Living Reward/Eco Home offer.

£11.4bn covers the period from January 2022 to September 2024.
In collaboration with the Green Finance Institute and 
NatWest Group, we have explored an alternative way 
for customers to access affordable and long-term 
funding for energy efficient improvements to buildings, 
by linking the finance to the property rather than the 
owner. Property Linked Finance (PLF) could provide 
an additional tool and incentive to bridge the current 
investment gap in decarbonising the UK’s housing stock. 
This report ‘A greenprint for Property Linked Finance in

Achieving net zero requires collective action due to 
the complex challenges across the residential sector. 
We recognise our pivotal role in facilitating this 
transition and supporting customers. Our strategy 
is twofold: increasing customer awareness of the 
benefits of transitioning and developing products 
that encourage necessary actions. 
To support customers, whether they are purchasing 
a new home or retrofitting their existing home, we 
have expanded our partnerships with industry. In 2024, 
we achieved a significant milestone by surpassing our 
ambition of lending £10 billion for EPC A and B rated 
properties between 2022 and 2024, exceeding the target 
by £1.4 billion. Building on this success, we aim to provide 
an additional £11 billion in EPC A/B lending by 2027.
Our commitment extends beyond incentivising energy 
efficient purchases, as we recognise the challenge of 
retrofitting our existing housing stock to meet net 
zero standards. To address this, we are enhancing our 
propositions to support customers in retrofitting, including 
partnering with trusted installers to simplify the process 
and collaborating across the industry to explore ways for 
customers to access affordable and long-term funding 
for energy efficient improvements to buildings.
Examples of our activities include:
Expanding our partnerships – Our partnership with 
Effective Home now supports customers seeking both 
solar panels and batteries, as well as insulation, 
removing the barrier of finding trusted, accredited 
suppliers. Additionally, our partnership with Octopus 
Energy continues to offer air source heat pumps to UK 
households, supporting the decarbonisation of domestic 
heating. Through these partnerships, we provide 
customers with additional financial incentives, such 
as up to £1,000 discount on solar panel and batteries 
(which could be claimed on top of Green Living Reward), 
for which we expanded eligibility to open market. 
Implementation strategy 
We have further developed our Halifax Green Living 
Reward and Lloyds Bank Eco Home Reward, enabling 
eligible customers to claim up to £2,000 cashback for 
a heat pump, £1,000 cashback for solar panels and/or 
a battery, or £500 for other eligible energy efficient 
home improvements. We’ve increased the financial 
incentive, which is now enduring, expanded eligibility 
to customers who apply for their mortgage via an 
intermediary, and simplified the digital journey 
for customers to claim these rewards. 
Additionally, we’ve partnered with chartered surveyors 
e.surv to offer free EPC assessments to customers who 
have successfully claimed the cashback reward, fostering 
greater consumer awareness of the energy efficiency 
benefits of their chosen retrofit measures. Engagement 
with and uptake of the offer have consistently 
maintained momentum. Previous iterations of the 
proposition had application windows of 6-12 months, 
and during these periods, we successfully provided over 
3,500 customers with a cashback reward.
We have also introduced EPC-linked affordability 
to better reflect energy bill costs in our affordability 
calculations.
Our online Home Energy Saving Tool, developed in 
collaboration with the Energy Saving Trust, continues 
to be a key engagement technique, providing 
customers with an interactive experience to generate 
a personalised plan for their home, identifying where 
energy efficiency improvements can be made. We’ve 
enhanced the Birmingham Midshires customer journey 
following the expansion of the Home Energy Saving Tool 
to this brand last year. Since launch, over 50,000 action 
plans have been generated. 
We offer a wealth of material available on our Halifax 
and Lloyds hubs and have been working with our 
intermediaries business to engage brokers on 
sustainability and available products. Our Broker 
Education activities include thought leadership articles

Risks and dependencies
Dependencies
Our ambition to achieve a 41 per cent reduction in financed 
emissions intensity by 2030 underscores our commitment 
to lowering the emissions of properties within our mortgage 
portfolio. However, reaching this ambition requires 
collective action from a diverse group of stakeholders, 
including government and broader industry.
To progress at the pace required to reach our 2030 
ambition we are dependent on several key areas including:
•	
Decarbonising the electricity grid, the largest expected 
contributor to UK housing emission reduction by 2030
•	
Increasing public awareness to encourage behavioural 
changes which are crucial to drive the level of adoption 
required to decarbonise the UK housing stock
•	
Strong government and market incentives, supported 
by a robust retrofit supply chain to enable residential 
owner-occupied and buy-to-let customers to retrofit 
their properties
•	
Continued support for the supply and quality of energy 
efficient new build properties to ensure availability 
of high standard homes
•	
Growth in uptake of low carbon heating, addressing 
higher cost of electricity compared to gas, which 
may make technologies such as heat pumps less 
economically attractive due to higher running costs
Risks
While we continue to make progress in reducing our 
financed emissions intensity from the 2020 baseline, 
there is still a substantial amount of future abatement 
which either lacks policies or depends on policies which 
are not ambitious enough or carry significant risks. We are 
beginning to see a divergence from our pathway ambitions 
due to aforementioned dependencies, underscoring the 
need for more robust and decisive action. To ensure 
continued progress in reducing emissions, it is vital to drive 
action in the key areas mentioned above. Furthermore, 
enhancing data quality and availability is crucial to support 
these initiatives.
Decarbonisation of the electricity grid
•	
Escalating geopolitical tensions may threaten oil 
and gas exports. This situation may lead to price 
volatility in the UK and hinder ongoing investments 
in decarbonisation efforts
Greater public awareness of energy efficiency
•	 Many UK properties lack a valid EPC, and existing 
EPCs often don’t reflect actual energy consumption 
or recent retrofits, making it difficult to engage 
customers on energy efficiency
•	 These EPC shortcomings hinder our ability to 
accurately report on the emissions of homes in our 
portfolio and don’t allow us to track changes in 
customer demand for energy
•	 While commitments made by the government in relation 
to decarbonising residential homes – such as the pledge 
to consult on reinstating proposed BTL EPC C Minimum 
Energy Efficiency Standards in the private rented sector 
– represent an upgrade in ambition, there is an 
opportunity to further accelerate the transition to net 
zero. As highlighted by the CCC, it is essential that the 
government implements ambitious policies that align 
with net zero standards and provide greater policy 
clarity. This will enable businesses and consumers 
to confidently prepare for the transition
Strong government and market incentives
•	
The CCC July 2024 Progress Report notes that 
government-funded energy efficiency measure 
installations are not increasing as expected. There 
is also a significant data gap covering installations 
outside these schemes
•	
Consumers still face numerous barriers such as a lack 
of awareness about retrofit benefits and the retrofit 
process itself, including the need for trusted suppliers. 
Additionally, the short-term costs of retrofitting may 
not sufficiently offset the long-term financial benefits, 
creating further obstacles
Energy efficient new build properties
•	 To date we have seen a contraction in new build 
properties; if this trend continues it may result in 
limited access to high-quality sustainable housing
•	 While the government has announced an ambitious 
target of delivering 1.5 million new homes by the end 
of the parliament, it is important to ensure these 
homes are built with low carbon heating systems 
and high energy efficiency standards. This will help 
minimise the need for future retrofitting
•	 Overall, the aggregation of multiple risks, including 
those called out above is making it challenging for 
our customers to act. The slow adoption of energy 
efficient measures highlights the need for continued 
innovation to drive widespread action. Without this 
progress, achieving our net zero target will become 
increasingly difficult

Transition plan by system continued
We’ve also introduced offers for our colleagues, allowing 
them to benefit from discounts on retrofit measures 
installed by our accredited partners. Additionally, we 
ran colleague competitions to award a select number of 
colleagues access to free solar panels and insulation via our 
accredited partners, creating ‘sustainability pioneers’ from 
whom we can learn about their experiences and inspire 
our colleague base. We recognise that more needs to be 
done to ensure a fair transition for all, and we welcome 
any funding for research and development in green 
technologies to make retrofitting affordable for the 
broader market.
In November 2024, we convened multiple strategic 
partners across the housing market to share key priority 
areas for the housing industry, including the focus on 
sustainability. This collaboration event represented a 
unique opportunity for the retail and corporate teams 
to bring together a mix of stakeholders from across the 
housing sector. Attendees included builders, mortgage 
advice firms, housing associations, trade bodies and other 
key groups who are crucial in supporting the sustainability 
ambitions of the UK housing market. We won’t stop here: 
we are keen to keep momentum going, and together strive 
to make the idea of a better, more sustainable housing 
market a reality. 
See page 95 for an overview of this system.
Engagement strategy
We are engaging on our policy asks through multiple 
channels including hosting roundtable events and one-to-
one meetings with MPs, peers and policy advisers to discuss 
and garner advocacy and support for our proposals. We 
continue to ensure MP constituency factsheets are updated 
with our core policy asks to help ensure our key messages 
are clear, understood and considered. 
We are committed to achieving a net zero mortgage 
portfolio as outlined in our ambition. However, we 
recognise that robust government support is essential 
to accelerate progress and build momentum. Our net 
zero pathway depends on several external factors, as 
outlined earlier in the report, which require government 
intervention, and regulatory and policy support to create 
the right conditions for this transition. Our strategic 
approach includes ongoing advocacy for policy changes 
that will facilitate the journey to net zero, highlighting 
the critical role of government support in achieving 
our ambition.
Just transition
To effectively support the transition to net zero, we must 
consider the needs of various groups including vulnerable 
and low-income households. Our products and services 
cater to a wide range of customer segments, and we aim to 
ensure our educational materials highlight actions that can 
be taken at different investment levels. Where applicable, 
we direct customers to specific government grant schemes 
that can help cover the costs of some retrofit measures.
To make energy efficient home improvements more 
accessible, we’ve expanded eligibility of incentives on 
retrofit measures via our partnerships so all customers 
beyond those in our Homes portfolio, and even periodically 
beyond the Group, can benefit. For example, in November 
2024, we ran an open market campaign offering £1,000 
off installation of solar panels via our partnership with 
Effective Home to any eligible homeowner, whether our 
customer or not. We have also introduced EPC-linked 
affordability to better reflect energy bill costs in our 
affordability calculations.

C&RRE
Commercial and residential real estate sector
Decarbonising existing buildings will be achieved primarily 
through retrofitting buildings to improve energy efficiency 
and replacing fossil-fuel heating systems with low carbon 
equivalents. At year-end 2023 our drawn lending to this 
sector was £20.1 billion, making decarbonisation of the 
commercial and residential real estate sector a priority for us.
In 2025 we are expanding 
our collaboration with 
CFP Green Buildings, 
and the Green Buildings 
Tool, to improve the 
accuracy of client 
emissions assessments.
48%
C&RRE emissions intensity reduction 
(kgCO2e/m2) between 2021 and 2030
Target
Last year we developed a 2030 target for our Commercial 
Banking C&RRE portfolio based on the 1.5°C aligned balanced 
net zero pathway of the Climate Change Committee. Based 
on our baseline portfolio composition, it requires an average 
reduction in emissions intensity of 48 per cent between 
2021 and 2030, reducing our 2021 absolute emissions from 
39kgCO2e/m2 to 21kgCO2e/m2. The 2021 portfolio baseline and 
subsequent years have been restated. The portfolio baseline 
has moved from 45kgCO2e/m2 to 39kgCO2e/m2, driven by 
improved matching and estimates of property types which 
have different emission intensities.
Progress update
From 2021 to 2023 the emissions intensity of the C&RRE 
portfolio reduced by 3 per cent, from 39kgCO2e/m2 to 
38kgCO2e/m2, driven by a slight shift towards social housing 
assets which are lower emission intensity and some 
improvement in EPC ratings. Increased annual emissions 
intensity percentage reduction will be required in the 
future (recognising reduction will not be linear) and 
the CCC BNZ pathway is heavily reliant on policy (e.g. 
minimum EPC standards) and low carbon heat adoption.
Given its materiality both to the UK and the Group, 
commercial and residential real estate is a crucial sector 
to decarbonise to meet net zero ambitions. Our clients’ 
adoption of low carbon heating (LCH) will have the single 
most significant effect on achieving our ambition. We have 
developed a suite of lending propositions to support our 
clients to build, refinance and acquire green buildings, 
as well as to retrofit their existing buildings. Funding the 
transition will continue to be a key focus in 2025. Alongside 
a supportive policy environment, developing products 
and propositions which incentivise and support our 
clients to adopt LCH and retrofit assets to improve 
energy efficiency will be critical. 
We are dedicated to helping the sector understand 
emissions and have continued to develop our Green 
Buildings Tool (GBT), a free digital insights calculator 
which helps clients assess and create a business case 
for improving the energy efficiency of their buildings. 
In 2024 we expanded the use of our ESG Tool (see 
Implementation strategy
page 128) to include more specific questions aimed at 
understanding our clients’ transition journey, including 
actions taken so far. 
We continue to work in partnership with industry bodies 
to support the transition and in 2024, became the only 
financial institution to be Organisational Programme 
Partner of the UK Green Buildings Council with active 
participation across all workstreams. We also continue 
to be an anchor supporter and board member of 
Sustainability for Housing, the number 1 sustainability 
reporting standard in UK Social Housing and the 
NextGeneration sustainability project and core 
standards for SME housebuilders and developers. 
Our efforts in the sector were recognised through the 
Property Week RESI Award for Large Financier of the 
Year and Real Estate Capital’s award for Sustainable 
Finance Provider of the Year: Europe. See page 22 for

Risks and dependencies
Decarbonisation of this sector is heavily dependent 
on clients adopting low carbon heating. As highlighted 
in the system introduction, the CCC highlights the UK is 
not retrofitting buildings fast enough (‘Red’ on Sixth carbon 
budget progress). Therefore, the transition of this sector 
has a critical dependency on accelerated policy action. 
Although the new government has signalled a policy 
shift in the progressive direction, decarbonisation of this 
sector will need a further acceleration in public policy, 
including on LCH installation, mandatory energy efficiency 
improvement, training of installers and the economics 
of retrofit and LCH. 
Internally, there are several data challenges including 
quality and completeness. In 2024, we looked to address 
these by investing in the functionalities of the GBT and 
other internal data sources. As we recognise that EPCs 
(the most commonly available data source) do not always 
provide an accurate view of a building’s actual energy 
consumption, we are investigating alternative assessment 
models. EPCs are also limited to estimating regulated 
energy use only (from space and water heating, lighting 
and ventilation), and therefore we need to estimate 
unregulated energy use (based on information from the 
government’s Building Energy Efficiency Survey). The need 
for widespread improvements in emission measurements 
for buildings is well recognised, with metered energy use 
being a future opportunity to improve accuracy, subject 
to data being made available. 
Just transition
Improving the energy efficiency and rollout of low carbon 
heating in commercial and residential buildings brings benefits 
beyond the environment because of more comfortable 
conditions and manageable energy bills, which in turn has 
the potential to support economic growth, enhance social 
development and help build wealth. To support a just 
transition, it is essential that energy efficiency rollout 
reaches across society, including the fuel poor and lower 
income households. Our partnership with the National 
Wealth Fund is one initiative that supports these homes 
(see page 20 for more details). 
Our consultations with the industry have highlighted a need 
to make this sector more attractive to reduce the skills gap 
in the market as well as upskill those within it. We have 
been supporting the industry in addressing this through 
our long-standing partnership with Regeneration Brainery 
as well as Real Estate Balance (for more details see page 23).
Engagement strategy 
We continue to engage in policy advocacy both 
independently and through our affiliation with industry. 
Through our Credible Transition Plan activity, we continue 
to engage with our most material clients by the end of 2025 
on their transition to net zero, including an expectation 
that clients’ carbon reduction goals will be aligned with 
scenarios limiting global warming to no more than 1.5°C. 
In 2024, we have integrated nature and environment 
questions in our ESG Risk Tool for our CIB and medium 
corporate clients (more details on page 128).

It was great to work with Raj 
Jayaprakash, Director of Corporate 
Real Estate at Lloyds Bank, 
alongside the GPE team to 
structure a financing that rewards 
the achievement of an impressive 
commercial real estate 
sustainability strategy – particularly 
for nature. GPE’s decarbonisation 
ambitions also align with our own 
to reduce the emissions intensity 
of our portfolio under the NZBA.” 
Chinyelu Oranefo
Managing Director, Sustainability 
Advisory, Real Estate and Housing
In 2024, Lloyds Bank acted as sole 
sustainability coordinator on a 
£150 million sustainability-linked 
syndicated Revolving Credit Facility 
to Great Portland Estates (GPE), a 
leading UK real estate company with 
a sophisticated sustainability strategy. 
The £150 million of sustainability-
linked lending is aligned to GPE’s 
sustainability ‘Statement of Intent – 
The Time is Now v 2.0’.
GPE’s strategy focuses on:
•	 Integrating climate resilience 
•	 Decarbonising the business 
by 2040
•	 Putting health and wellbeing 
front and centre
•	 Creating a lasting positive social 
impact in its communities
These key performance indicators 
included improving the energy 
efficiency intensity and embodied 
carbon of its portfolio in addition 
to increasing biodiversity net gain 
in operational areas on and around 
GPE’s estate, which is over and 
above what is mandated under law.
Engagement strategy
We also continue to engage government as its 
support is required to build further momentum and 
awareness. We have developed our engagement 
strategy to several areas, including:
01
Policy and regulatory clarity for a clear trajectory 
for direct regulatory levers and critical indirect 
dependencies (including energy market reform, 
and decisions on the future heating mix, e.g. hydrogen, 
heat networks).
02
Emissions measurement: through improved EPCs 
and real time energy use.
03
Skills and labour supply, to boost skills availability 
in the supply chain.
04
Access to expertise to improve provision of advice 
for building users and facilitate their transition.
05
Availability of feasible financial mechanisms to 
implement financial incentives for improving energy 
efficiency and/or installing low-carbon heating systems.

Lloyds Living
Lloyds Living, formerly branded as 
Citra Living, provides high-quality 
properties for rental and shared 
ownership. 
Up to October 2024, Lloyds Living completed on 2,660 
homes. Of these, 74 per cent were EPC rated A or B. These 
have been our areas of focus as part of our sustainability 
strategy:
Data and strategy 
With an increasing portfolio and carbon footprint, our 
primary focus for 2024 has been to establish a baseline for 
our scope 1 and 2 emissions from Lloyds Living properties 
including shared landlord areas and show homes. The total 
emissions for 2023/24 was 128tCO2e and has been included 
within our Streamlined Energy Carbon Reporting for the 
first time in 2024 (see annual report and accounts 2024 
 
pages 59 to 60). Work is under way to measure Lloyds 
Living’s scope 3 emissions. 
We will continue to evolve our sustainability strategy 
and adapt our plans as we start to understand more about 
the performance of our homes and continue to innovate 
and trial new opportunities as we seek to reduce our 
environmental impact for the benefit of our communities. 
Building standards 
In 2024, we have worked towards ensuring that 50 per cent 
of contracted projects for new build homes met 
NextGeneration standards. As of the end of 2024, 50 per 
cent meet our criteria. 
We will continue to encourage our development partners 
to sign up to NextGeneration, when possible. We have 
contracted on our first Future Homes scheme and have 
extended our Zero Bills pilot to a further 23 homes. 
We are proud to have 16 properties that meet the 
government’s Future Homes Standard, ahead of its 
implementation date in 2025. 
The Future Homes Standard is a set of regulations for new 
homes in the UK that aim to reduce carbon emissions and 
make them energy efficient properties. In addition, we have
146 homes completed to new Part L standards (meaning 
they produce 31 per cent less emissions through improved 
insulation) and we have conducted an energy use and 
performance pilot on a further 123 existing properties.
NextGeneration is a sustainability benchmark for UK 
homebuilders. It sets out what good practice looks like 
and drives change in the industry, with the criteria of 
the benchmarks being publicly available.
Biodiversity
In line with UK law (Sch 7A TCPA 1990) new developments 
granted planning permission since legislation came into 
place are set to achieve a minimum of 10 per cent 
Biodiversity Net Gain. However, delays in implementing this 
planning regulation, meant that new build sites that Lloyds 
Living contracted in 2024 were consented under the old 
regulations and as such, were not subject to Biodiversity 
Net Gain requirements. Therefore, the opportunities to 
deliver against the 2024 pledge of 10 per cent of new 
developments achieving 10 per cent Biodiversity Net Gain 
were limited. 
In 2025, we will review our strategy with regard to Biodiversity 
Net Gain and develop an approach to delivering 
improvements to biodiversity on our existing sites. 
Travel
We evaluate the accessibility of sites through public transport 
to help reduce car dependency. Where parking is provided 
onsite, we will work with our development partners to 
increase the provision of electric vehicle charging points.

Home insurance
The Group (including its associated 
brands)1 offers buildings and contents 
insurance to UK residents. 
We aim to support customers in improving the resilience 
of their homes against extreme weather caused by climate 
change. As a business, we also strive to advocate for 
change with policymakers and other firms in the industry.
1	
The home insurance liabilities are managed under Scottish Widows Group.
Our strategy – two key areas: 
1. Propositions to improve resilience 
Climate change is projected to alter the frequency, 
severity and location of weather events that impact our 
UK general insurance portfolio. Our home insurance 
products provide cover for all weather perils, for 
example, flood, windstorm, subsidence and freeze. 
These are the perils that are most affected by climate 
change, and we will look to continue to provide these 
coverages in the future.
The UK is expected to experience increases in extreme 
rainfall leading to increased flooding. Whilst river and 
coastal flooding can be modelled with catchment-scale 
hydrological models allowing for advance planning in 
mitigation measures, the nature of surface water 
flooding (localised and difficult to predict) makes 
equivalent mitigation planning more challenging. 
Given the increasing frequency and devastating 
household impacts of flooding, flood resilience is a 
priority for us in supporting our customers. We recognise 
the opportunity and imperative to improve the flood 
resistance and resilience of those homes that are most 
at risk of flooding. 
 
Our Build Back Better initiative (backed by Flood Re) is a 
commitment to spend up to £10,000 per claim on 
specialist flood surveys and fitting property flood 
resistance and/or resilience measures following eligible 
flood claims. To identify the most appropriate measures 
for eligible customers – including floodgates and 
self-closing air bricks – we have onboarded specialist 
flood surveyors to provide expert advice to our 
customers. The Build Back Better scheme went live on 
1 July 2022 and the first eligible claim was registered the 
following month.
To help customers protect themselves and their homes 
from the physical impacts of weather events, we can 
reach out, via email, social media and our banking app, 
with various elements of advice and guidance. In the 
lead-up to winter 2024, we issued communications to 
offer advice on how to protect homes against the 
impacts of wintry weather, such as burst pipes. 
Alongside preventative communications, we also reach 
out to our customers ahead of severe weather events. 
2. Advocating change 
To facilitate systemic change, we believe that acting as a 
convener and creating a platform for open dialogue and 
a diverse representation of expertise outside of just 
financial services will help us to solve the challenges we 
now face. To these ends we are building relationships 
with experts to enhance our understanding of 
sustainability. For instance, we are collaborating with 
academic institutions to study the impact of climate 
change on windstorm risk. We have also identified the 
need to advocate for change within policymaking, 
leveraging our relationships within government and 
industry to influence policy in both flood resilience and 
broader weather-related resilience and adaptation 
efforts. 
Insurance emissions methodology 
Whilst there is currently no prescribed methodology for 
measuring emissions on insured properties to support net 
zero progress and reporting, we will continue to monitor 
and engage with developments in this area.

Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Transition plan by system continued
System focus 
Surface transport is the highest emitting sector in the UK. 
Our low carbon transport system addresses transport 
by road and by air. It includes our retail vehicle leasing 
and financing activity, as well as support for transport 
operators, the companies that manufacture vehicles to 
produce cleaner more efficient vehicles, and those that 
develop greener alternative fuels. Emissions for our rail 
and shipping activities within the transport sector are not 
currently included, due to their low materiality and our 
limited exposure to those transport sectors.
System interactions
The Low Carbon Transport System has close interaction 
with the Energy System and Greening the Built 
Environment with a significant increase in public charging 
infrastructure needed alongside energy network upgrades 
and cost-effective tariffs to accommodate demand needed 
to support adoption of electric vehicles. Low carbon 
electricity is also critical for the decarbonisation of the 
low carbon transport system. Further battery supply, 
development and improvements, increasing use of second-
life batteries and the development of alternative fuels for 
heavier vehicles or aviation are other areas of interaction. 
As part of our updated materiality assessment for the 
Commercial banking portfolio, we identified that this 
sector can significantly impact nature through disturbance 
and emissions of greenhouse gases and non-greenhouse 
gases. Supporting the transition to a low carbon road 
transport sector will, however, reduce the number of 
pollutants that enter the atmosphere. 
System challenges 
The most material policy impact for this system is across 
road transport, driven by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) 
mandate which is noted to have made good progress 
by the CCC July 2024 Progress Report, together with 
the government’s decision to reinstate the original targets 
and the recent consultation on the implementation 
of the mandate. 
There is some uncertainty on the growth in the used EV 
market, due to customer concerns on battery life, vehicle 
range and volatile pricing as new manufacturers enter to 
the market supplying lower-cost models. Further, despite 
some progress for public charging infrastructure, significant 
scale-up is needed to meet expected future growing 
demand supported by affordable, accessible charging 
solutions including where residents do not have home 
off-street parking and currently rely on public charging 
infrastructure, which is more expensive than home energy.
A wider system challenge stems from aviation which is a 
hard-to-abate sector. Despite the inclusion of 
a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) revenue support 
mechanism in the King’s Speech much of the technology 
available to decarbonise the aviation sector is nascent, 
with significant investment still required to scale 
production of SAF.

Our actions 
To date we have developed products and propositions to 
help customers understand the best way to transition to 
greener vehicles and to ensure switching to electric fuel types 
is as hassle-free and cost-effective as possible, including via 
partnerships. We are also engaging our corporate clients to 
set science-based targets and with government and other 
external stakeholders to ensure there is a supportive external 
environment to facilitate transition. Moving forward we will 
need to consider how we can further facilitate the move 
to greener vehicles and the required supportive infrastructure 
by considering data and insights centred on cross-system 
areas noted above and associated new financing 
opportunities or models.
Building on this activity, and utilising a systems approach, 
in 2024 we considered the changes needed across the 
transport value chain to support the system to transition 
to net zero, including interactions with other systems 
as summarised on page 104. This approach has initially 
focused on the road transport system based on materiality. 
We expect this to continue to evolve and develop to 
support other targets.
This approach supported us to begin to identify the priority 
actions moving forward for this system to unlock the progress 
needed and support our customers, which include:
01
Considering how we can help create an accessible, 
stable low carbon Road Transport market, with 
a focus on EVs (used), LCVs and buses. This will 
include risk considerations given challenges with 
EV residual values. Further, data requirements 
such as EV charging insights can be utilised to 
lower barriers to entry alongside innovative 
financing models.
02
Increasing use of data to better understand our 
customers, support them to understand the 
changes and benefits needed to switch to EVs or 
LCVs and understand the synergies with their 
home or place of work to enable them to switch.
03
Further facilitating the move to greener vehicles 
by considering support for the required 
supportive infrastructure and insights centred on 
cross-system areas noted above and associated 
new financing opportunities or models including 
connected car data, payment solutions, car 
sharing/flexible leasing and mobility as a service.

Transition plan by system continued
Retail motor
The Group has one of the largest 
vehicle finance and leasing portfolios in 
the UK, playing a significant role in the 
successful transition to a sustainable 
transport model.
Through Lex Autolease, Black Horse and Tusker, along with 
our core-bank brands, our Transport business leases and 
finances 1.2 million vehicles on the road today, including 
over 260 thousand low emission vehicles. 
See page 104 to 105 for details of Low Carbon Transport 
system.
Target
Our target is to reduce the emissions intensity for cars and 
light commercial vehicles (LCVs) by more than 50 per cent 
by 2030 (from a 2018 baseline – scope 1 and 2) equating to 
75gCO2e/km or less down from 150gCO2e/km for cars and 
99gCO2e/km or less down from 198gCO2e/km for LCVs.
At the time of setting our targets, we applied the same 
assumptions on adoption for electric LCVs as for electric 
cars. Scenarios now provide separate adoption rates for 
LCVs, and we will review the LCVs target once the CCC 
publishes the Seventh Carbon Budget in 2025, ensuring 
we reflect the latest position.

Progress update
We have made positive progress as displayed in the charts and 
between 2018 and 2023 achieved a reduction in car emissions 
intensity from 150gCO2e/km to 135gCO2e/km and a reduction 
LCVs emissions intensity from 198gCO2e/km to 190gCO2e/km.

The reference pathway will be reviewed based on the CCC’s 7th Carbon Budget 
published in February 2025.
As a Group, we are well prepared for the transition from 
internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to electric vehicles 
(EVs). In 2024 we reached and exceeded our £8 billion 
green lending target for new battery electric and plug-in 
hybrid electric vehicles. We provided £3.7 billion of 
lending bringing our total since 2022 to £9.4 billion.
Over the past five years, our primary focus has been 
on cars. Through our Tusker brand we provide fully 
maintained and insured salary sacrifice schemes and 
through Lex Autolease, a comprehensive leasing solution 
and car policy guidance enabling customers to transition 
their fleets to zero emission to help accelerate EV 
adoption rates. 
Access to used EVs
In 2024, we launched initiatives to support accessibility 
to EVs, particularly in the used market. 
We extended the age and mileage parameters for 
vehicles we finance in Black Horse and provide longer 
contracts with lower monthly payments, enabling us to 
finance more EVs longer into their lives. The maximum 
finance term for an EV is now nine years.
In September 2024, our Tusker brand launched its used 
salary sacrifice scheme for corporate fleets. This not only 
aids a reduction in the carbon impact associated with 
manufacturing new vehicles but also gives lower rate 
taxpayers access to a wider selection of affordable EVs.
We have also expanded our used leasing proposition 
in Lex Autolease further from its initial launch in 2023 
and have now financed over 2,000 used EVs.
EV charging access
In 2024, we launched new referral solutions for EV 
charging services for Lex corporate and salary sacrifice 
customers to support and simplify their transition 
journey. These solutions offer our customers and drivers 
access to home chargers, smart EV energy tariffs and 
access to UK public charging networks via a single 
payment card. 
Implementation strategy
Going forward, we will expand partnership opportunities 
further to support more drivers in their EV transition 
journey, whilst continuing focus on our key priorities 
to support accessibility and affordability, consumer 
confidence and the supporting infrastructure.

Our Group strategy
Overview
continue to improve our monitoring and management 
of RVs. To address these challenges consumers must be 
provided with up-to-date education on the benefits of 
electrification, and charging infrastructure must continue 
to grow at pace with innovative solutions crucial for those 
who do not have access to off-street parking. As of 
September 2024, there has been an over 40 per cent 
year-on-year increase in the number of public charging 
devices1. However, there remains a need to focus on 
investment in the affordability and accessibility of private 
charging infrastructure. 
The October 2024 fiscal budget announced the following 
policy relating to our transition to net zero, including:
•	
Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) changes
•	
Employer NI contributions raised to 15 per cent
•	
Adjusted Benefit in Kind to 2030
•	
Change in taxation of double cab pick-ups
Engagement strategy
A key element of our strategy involves collaborating 
with policymakers to create an attractive market for both 
new and used EVs and to enhance the UK’s charging 
infrastructure. As a leading UK provider of eco-friendly 
fleets for businesses, we facilitate access to greener 
vehicles for our customers. We are confident that we can 
help meet the challenge of keeping the nation moving 
in a more sustainable way up to and beyond 2030. 
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Transition plan by system continued
The CCC July Progress Report observed that new van sales 
in the UK were ‘significantly off track’. There are several 
challenges hindering growth in the van market, including 
mileage range, limited product choice and a small used 
market. The product range for business use is limited and 
erosion of financial benefits from rising energy prices and 
reduced grants presents further challenge.
For consumers, the higher initial cost of vehicles and 
concerns about charging infrastructure continue to be 
major obstacles to transition, especially when the potential 
long-term savings are unclear. New manufacturers entering 
the market are expected to cause further disruption, with 
lower new car prices putting an equal downward pressure 
on used EV values. 
Residual Value (RV) is a key risk that arises from this, and 
we look for stability in terms of government and consumer 
sentiment as a key enabler. In the meantime, we will 
Risks and dependencies
The government’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate 
outlines the expectation for 80 per cent of new cars and 
70 per cent of new LCVs sold in the UK to be zero emission 
by 2030, increasing to 100 per cent by 2035. For cars, our 
current projections indicate that this is achievable, and we 
are making good progress towards this through our leasing 
in corporate and salary sacrifice segments.
The government’s decision in 2024 to reinstate the 2030 
ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles will 
hopefully urge both businesses and consumers to act 
on their own transition journey to electric, but we 
acknowledge that there is still progress to be made 
to facilitate this move. 
In December 2024, a further two month consultation 
was announced by the UK government which will seek 
views on how the industry can be supported in achieving 
the delivery of the commitment to end the sale of new cars 
and LCVs powered solely by ICE by 2030 and how the 
mandate could operate beyond 2030.
We continue to work with industry bodies and partners 
to help drive change, these include:
•	 The Climate Group – UK Electric Fleets Coalition: 
In 2021 we became part of the Climate Group’s UK 
Electric Fleets Coalition steering group. As a select 
group of business leaders, we use our market 
expertise to advocate for UK policy changes that 
promote the move to EVs, including stimulating 
EV supply and investing EV charging infrastructure
•	 Electric Vehicle Fleet Accelerator (EVFA): We 
became part of an initiative to tackle challenges 
by creating a platform for members to collaborate, 
identify potential solutions and leverage aggregate 
corporate demand. This effort supports a joint 
commitment to buy 100,000 British manufactured 
LCVs by the end of the decade, or sooner if 
availability allows
Just transition
Used EV leasing – We are continuing to develop our 
used EV offering and will be using data to optimise 
repatriation into our used finance propositions. Helping 
to drive price parity for consumers in the electric space, 
as well as providing up-to-date education on the 
benefits of the used market, are key goals. Older EVs 
can provide benefits to our customers via a cheaper 
purchase price and typically require less maintenance 
than ICE vehicles.
The expansion of our used leasing proposition in Lex 
Autolease and launch of the Tusker used salary sacrifice 
scheme in 2024 have supported these developments and 
have helped make EVs more accessible for more customers.
Online Education Hubs – This year, we launched the 
new Black Horse EV hub aimed at helping customers 
address the key concerns of EV transition. Our Lex EV 
Hub for corporate customers continues to develop as 
we look to provide customers with the most up-to-date 
information on their journey to electric. In addition, we 
continue to update and improve our education content 
on the Tusker EV hub for our salary sacrifice customers.

Road passenger

Our clients whose primary business is 
transportation of passengers includes 
buses, coaches, taxis and rentals. 
Decarbonisation of this sector is driven by the move from 
internal combustion engines to low or zero emission 
alternatives such as electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles.

Engage with clients to set their own 
credible targets (1.5°C aligned) 
by end of 2025
Target
Last year we established a 2030 target for our 
Commercial Banking portfolio of corporate road passenger 
transport operators. Using the 1.5°C aligned balanced 
net zero pathway of the Climate Change Committee as 
our reference, our target requires an emissions intensity 
reduction of 49 per cent from our 2019 baseline of 
141gCO2e/pkm to 72gCO2e/pkm by 2030. The 2019 
portfolio baseline and subsequent years have been 
restated. The portfolio baseline has moved from 165gCO2e/
pkm to 141gCO2e/pkm, driven by updated client and sector 
emission and passenger data being published or identified. 
We selected 2019 as the baseline year due to the impacts 
of the COVID-19 lockdowns on passenger behaviour 
in the years 2020 and 2021, and the unavailability 
of the 2022 data. 
 
The availability of granular client emissions data is a 
challenge for setting a target in this sector. Due to 
challenges accessing data for SME clients, our target covers 
larger clients in our corporate and institutional business. 
Even for larger clients, there are methodological challenges 
in translating available Scope 1 emissions data into an 
intensity metric due to the lack of client-level passenger km 
data, meaning that significant assumptions are required. 
Progress update
From 2019 to 2023 the emissions intensity decreased 
from 141gCO2e/pkm to 130gCO2e/pkm. This is due to client 
emission reductions over the period, and a change 
in portfolio mix including additional lending to lower 
emission intensity clients as part of the strategy to support 
the transition. 
Risks and dependencies
Decarbonising the road passenger sector faces challenges, 
including passenger demand, a supportive policy 
environment, charging infrastructure, and a supply of low 
carbon fuels. 
For bus, coach and taxi operators, demand for travel is 
crucial to incentivise the move to low carbon vehicles. For 
rentals, the transition to EVs has slowed and is increasingly 
dependent on customer demand for EVs over conventional 
internal combustion engines. This choice is influenced by 
cost, battery mileage or easy access to reliable charging 
infrastructure. Our ability to deliver our target therefore 
depends on how consumer demand will evolve in response 
to economic and policy trends. 
Implementation 
strategy
We continue to engage our clients to set credible 
transition targets, aligned with 1.5°C, by the end 
of 2025. Beyond 2025, should they appear to 
be operating below our requirements, this will 
form part of our overarching ESG risk assessments 
and credit decisioning processes.
We are also targeting additional corporate lending, 
asset finance and project finance to bus owners 
and operators to finance the rollout of low carbon 
(electric and hydrogen) buses by 2030, as well 
as considering alternative technologies.

Engagement strategy
We have engaged all our most material clients within road 
passenger on their Credible Transition Plans (for more 
information on our CTP process see pages 85 to 87).
 
We will consider future engagement with government on 
transportation schemes, where we consider it appropriate, 
recognising that improved quality, increased availability 
and low emission public transportation are important 
factors in reducing emissions from the transport sector. 
As well as supporting reduced emissions it also has a 
positive impact on regional regeneration.
Just transition
A thriving public transport sector is essential for enabling 
cost-effective and environmentally sound travel for work 
and leisure. As the low carbon transport system undergoes 
transformative change, a key component of our strategy 
is to support the passenger transport sector to transition 
to net zero while continuing to serve their communities. 
As well as transitioning the transport sector to net zero, 
we want to see an increase in public transport being 
offered to incentivise greater usage. 
Zenobē, a leader in battery electric 
vehicle fleets and grid-scale battery 
storage, has secured over £1 billion in 
green debt funding since 2019. In February 
2024, Zenobē completed a landmark 
£410 million deal, the largest electric 
bus platform financing in Europe. This 
innovative finance solution, developed 
with 13 banks, including Lloyds Bank 
as Mandated Lead Arranger and largest 
lender (including Scottish Widows), will 
support the UK’s decarbonisation goals 
and the deployment of over 2,200 electric 
buses in the UK and Ireland by 2026.
 
Zenobē holds around 28 per cent of 
the UK electric bus market working with 
c.90 per cent of major bus companies. 
It operates in Europe and Australasia, 
and is expanding into North America 
supporting over 2,000 electric vehicles. 
Zenobē has also been awarded 
£41.7 million in the second phase of 
the Scottish Zero Emission Bus Challenge 
Fund to support the electrification of 
buses in Scotland. This will help deploy 
252 new zero emission buses and create 
a Scotland-wide charging network for
buses, coaches, and heavy goods
vehicles (HGVs).
 
Zenobē’s (and its peers’) initiatives 
are crucial for the UK’s net zero 
emissions goal by 2050, particularly 
in the transport sector, the largest 
contributor to domestic greenhouse 
emissions. Lloyds Bank, Scottish Widows 
and other financial partners are proud to 
support Zenobē with innovative financing 
solutions in this transformative journey 
towards a sustainable future. This case

Our Group strategy
Overview
Target
Reduce the emissions intensity per revenue tonne kilometre 
of our aviation portfolio by 31 per cent from a 2019 baseline 
of 1,068gCO2e/rtk, reaching 737gCO2e/rtk by 2030 (based 
on the IEA ETP 2020 scenario, aligned with well below 2°C). 
In our aviation portfolio we originally set a target to reduce 
emissions intensity by 31 per cent by 2030 to 633gCO2e/rtk 
from a baseline of 918gCO2e/rtk in 2019. The 2019 portfolio 
baseline and subsequent years has been restated. The 
baseline has increased by c.16 per cent to 1,068gCO2e/rtk, 
driven by client restatements. As a result, alignment to the 
same well below 2°C (WB2D) degree scenario pathway 
requires a 31 per cent reduction to 737gCO2e/rtk in the 
same period.

Aviation
Aviation (passenger and freight 
transport) is a hard-to-abate sector, 
with the required scale-up of 
sustainable aviation fuels and maturing 
of low carbon propulsion technologies 
still many years away.
See page 104 to 105 for details of this system.
31%
aviation emissions intensity 
reduction (gCO2e/rtk) between 
2019 and 2030
Risks and dependencies
Key sector dependencies include support from 
governments globally for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), 
scaling of SAF production, airport infrastructure to run 
blended fuels and availability of new aircraft as well as 
dependency on future alternative propulsion technologies 
(e.g. battery and hydrogen). 
There is heavy dependence on SAF scale-up, underpinned 
by policy. The EU committed earlier to an increasing SAF 
requirement, whilst in 2024 the UK laid out its policy, 
expected to commence from 2025. 
We remain dependent on development and scale of 
innovative technologies. Our clients have set targets 
aligned with WB2D or 1.5°C scenarios with actual emissions 
intensity reduction to 2023 showing they are in line with 
the reference pathway. We acknowledge the dependencies 
set out above may result in divergence in the future 
between actual emissions intensity and our 2030 target. 
Engagement strategy
In 2024 we announced we would be assessing the Credible 
Transition Plans of our most material aviation clients and 
are pleased to confirm we have done so (for more 
information on our CTP process see pages 85 to 87). We 
will continue embedding considerations of client targets, 
commitments, progress and transition plans into our 
decision making as appropriate.
During 2024, we engaged with government consultations 
and workshops on the design and delivery of a revenue 
certainty mechanism to support UK SAF production and 
boost its uptake. Through our responses we outlined what 
we believe is needed to finance SAF and provide producers 
with assurance needed to increase production. 
Just transition 
As the UK looks to scale up SAF production, in time it will 
be important to consider the social impacts of crop 
production for SAF to ensure that crop production for fuels 
does not compete or displace crop production for food. UK 
and EU policy already has considerations for this which may 
yet evolve. 
Progress update
From 2019 to 2023 emissions intensity decreased from 
1,068gCO2e/rtk to 904gCO2e/rtk. This is both due to sector 
changes whereby emissions per kilometre flown have 
reduced, and due to a slight reduction of our exposure 
to this portfolio.

In 2024, demand for air travel became comparable 
to pre-COVID-19, meaning that data became more 
comparable. Our key strategic lever for this sector 
continues to be working with our clients to set 
targets and develop plans aligned with a WB2D 
pathway. Although we encourage ambitious plans 
aligned with 1.5°C, we recognise that with today’s 
technology, the sector’s path is only aligned with 
a WB2D pathway. 
In 2024, many of our clients announced ambitious 
investment to enhance the efficiency of their 
fleets to be implemented over the next decade. 
We support clients through continued deployment 
of capital and risk management capabilities, whilst 
furthering alignment of finance and environmental 
performance through sustainability-linked financing 
facilities in which we have played roles as both 
lender and coordinator.
We further support sector transition throughout 
the manufacturing and wider aviation value chain 
in which we have grown our influence in 2024.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Target
Reduce the emissions intensity (including scope 1, 2 
and 3 emissions) of our automotive OEMs portfolio 
by 47 per cent from a 2020 baseline of 249gCO2e/vkm, 
reaching 133gCO2e/vkm in 2030. We originally set a target 
to reduce emissions intensity from a 2020 baseline of 
217gCO2e/vkm by 47 per cent to 115gCO2e/vkm by 2030. 
Previously, the emissions baselines of several key clients 
were based on estimated data.
In our refreshed version we have improved our 
methodology to use reported client disclosures where 
possible, resulting in a more accurate 2020 baseline 
of 249gCO2e/vkm, with this change also impacting 
subsequent years. As a result, alignment to the same 
1.5°C scenario pathway requires a 47 per cent reduction 
to 133gCO2e/vkm over the same period. We have also 
calculated the portfolio’s 2023 emissions intensity 
to be 259gCO2e/vkm.

Automotive original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs)
The production of vehicles is highly 
concentrated amongst the world’s 
largest automotive manufacturers. 
A key driver for automotive OEMs is consumer appetite 
for EVs, which in turn is dependent on the widespread 
availability of cost-effective charging infrastructure.
See pages 104 to 105 for details of this system.
We expect our clients to 
set targets which are either 
aligned with IEA NZE 2050 
or validated by SBTi.
47%
automotive OEMs emissions 
intensity reduction (gCO2e/vkm) 
between 2020 and 2030 
Progress update
From 2019 to 2023 emissions intensity increased from 
249gCO2e/vkm to 259gCO2e/vkm. This is due to a 
disproportional increase in total emissions in comparison 
to production data. Scope 3 decarbonisation remains a 
challenge for this sector. EV adoption may be improved 
upon as we progress to 2030 and beyond due to 
government targets.
Risks and dependencies
The transition of the automotive OEMs is key to delivering 
not only this target but also our targets in retail motor 
(cars and LCVs) and road passenger (buses, coaches, 
taxis and rentals). 
The key dependency for automotive OEMs is consumer 
appetite for EVs, which in turn is dependent on cost-of-
living conditions, improving battery technology to increase 
range, and the widespread availability of reliable, cost-
effective charging infrastructure. Price of EVs remains a 
barrier to entry for UK consumers, and despite continuous 
efforts from legacy western carmakers to make electric 
vehicles more affordable, a significant price gap between 
EVs and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles still 
remains. The policy landscape underpinning these is also 
increasingly critical. Uncertainty with regard to legislation 
and trade conditions between markets has slowed the 
demand for EVs.
Engagement strategy
In 2024 we announced that we would be assessing the 
Credible Transition Plans of our most material automotive 
clients (for more information on our CTP process see 
pages 85 to 87). We are pleased to confirm we have 
engaged all our most material automotive OEM clients on 
their Credible Transition Plans. We will continue to embed 
considerations of client targets, commitments, progress 
and transition plans into our decision-making processes 
by the end of 2025 as appropriate.

System summary
UK emissions1,2
Bank financed emissions3
4	
Estimated figures for 2020–2030, accurate at the time of publication of 
the CCC Sixth Carbon Budget.
System focus 
Our sustainable farming and food system addresses 
primary agriculture and the food value chain, which play 
a significant role in tackling many of the UK’s sustainability 
challenges. Alongside food production, British farmers also 
maintain c.70 per cent of the UK’s natural spaces and 
thereby have a key role to play in both protecting and 
restoring nature5.
Conversely, the food system makes up a large share of both 
global and UK GHG emissions, and is classified as a sector 
that is difficult to abate. Given our high market share, we 
have a greater exposure to this sector compared to the UK 
average, making it a material contributor to the Bank’s 
financed emissions. Developing more sustainable business 
models will require farmers and broader actors in the 
direct and indirect value chain to collaborate alongside 
a supportive policy environment. This includes food 
processors, wholesalers, retailers and restaurants as 
well as logistics businesses, financiers and insurers.
System interactions
Much like the other systems, there are several cross-system 
interdependencies to consider. Outside of growing more 
food for a growing population, there are multiple demands 
on land use that need to be considered. This includes 
cultivating trees for building materials, constructing homes, 
generating clean energy, absorbing emissions and 
supporting biodiversity. 
Many of these activities link this system with Energy 
Transition and Greening the Built Environment. Our nature 
materiality assessment highlights clear dependencies on the 
food system; for example, agriculture directly affects both 
soil quality and water scarcity. Adaptation and resilience 
to more extreme weather events will help to protect food 
production over the long term. Additionally, transporting 
and processing food involves the Low Carbon Transport 
and Energy systems, with implications for Circularity in 
food and packaging waste.
System challenges 
Unlike other systems, emissions are derived from natural 
processes which are challenging to abate. Decarbonisation 
of the food system (including agriculture) requires a number 
of transformations, both on supply and demand side. On 
the supply side, these include supporting farmers to adopt 
low carbon practices, increasing the focus on soil health, 
and supporting nature recovery, whilst on the demand side, 
this requires changes in consumer behaviour such as dietary 
shifts and reduction in food waste. There are also 
substantial challenges in identifying a standardised 
methodology for measuring farms’ environmental impact, 
which is a key enabler for transition. To date, these goals 
have been challenging to meet.
Many policies to aid transition have significant risks 
in delivering the reductions required, with the CCC 
noting no progress against a recommendation to 
publish a land use framework that brings these various 
challenges together. This is a material and important 
mechanism which can consider the multiple 
interactions highlighted. 
Our actions 
We recognise that establishing common metrics for 
environmental outcomes is an important lever in scaling the 
transition to regenerative practices. Since 2022, we have 
been working with the Soil Association Exchange (SAX) to 
measure our farmers’ environmental baselines to help 
unlock their potential to transition. 
The outputs of this work were summarised in our recent 
report, ‘Grounded in evidence: A way forward for British 
farms’, launched during Climate Week NYC. It covers the 
increased recognition from food value chain actors about 
the value of measuring sustainability claims ‘from farm to 
fork’, providing a clear opportunity for farmers to benefit6. 
As members of the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI) 
Agribusiness Task Force, we are exploring new financing 
mechanisms that both enhance collaboration within the 
food value chain and develop structures to directly support 
UK farmers. 
Moving forward through 2025, key areas of focus include:
01
Using our voice to articulate the challenges  
of our clients, through policy engagement with 
government and industry bodies.
02
In collaboration with SAX and Finance Earth, 
we are supporting a pilot of a new financing 
model, ‘Exchange Market’, to reward farmers 
for prioritising environmental outcomes. SAX  
will monitor and verify these outcomes, ensuring 
transparency and enabling supply chain partners 
to demonstrate impact. 
03
04
Engagement with our most material food, drink, 
and retail clients in corporate & institutional 
banking through the completion of Credible 
Transition Plan (CTP) assessments for the sector. 
This approach is described on pages 85 to 87.
Expanding on our current initiatives to enhance 
our strategy for the broader food value chain. 
This involves identifying opportunities and 
risks, and collaboratively developing solutions 
to transform the food system, which benefit 
our clients.

Banking agriculture portfolio using the CCC’s 1.5°C aligned 
balanced net zero pathway as our reference. Our target is 
to reduce absolute emissions by 25 per cent between 2021 
and 2030 (from 6.7MtCO2e to 5.0MtCO2e). There is a net 
increase in the financed emissions across the portfolio 
driven by an increase in external source emission factors 
from the Office for National Statistics, which are partially 
offset by a greater use of actual client emissions data, 
sourced via SAX which are observed to be lower on average 
than equivalent ONS emissions estimates for those clients. 
The portfolio absolute finance emissions for the 2021 
baseline year has increased from 6.3MtCO2e to 6.7MtCO2e.
Our target covers emissions from primary agriculture 
and does not include Land Use, Land Use Change and 
Forestry (LULUCF) measures (e.g. afforestation, peatland 
restoration and bio-energy crops which sequester carbon) 
as accounting for how these measures affect carbon 
emissions and sequestration is complex and currently very 
uncertain. However, we know that natural processes play 
a critical role in sequestering carbon. We are investigating 
data options in accounting for LULUCF measures, bearing 
in mind that LULUCF will become a necessity when we 
develop an agriculture net zero target beyond 2030.

agriculture absolute emissions reduction 
(MtCO2e) between 2021 and 2030
Progress update
From 2021 to 2023 the absolute emissions of the agriculture 
portfolio reduced by 12 per cent, from 6.7MtCO2e to 
5.9MtCO2e. This reduction is primarily driven by a reduction 
in drawn balances from the baseline year.
We are focused on supporting all parts of the sector 
to transition to net zero. We do not intend to withdraw 
financing from any sub-sector, recognising the potential 
economic and societal impacts this may create (e.g. 
on UK food security and rural employment).
British agriculture is changing and finds itself under more 
pressure than ever. The UK is one of the most nature 
depleted countries in the world and it’s estimated that 
soil degradation is costing £1.2 billion a year1, while 
a third of farms in the UK fail to make a profit when 
considering Net Farm Income. 
Through our partnership with the Soil Association 
Exchange (SAX) 
 we have developed tools and services 
to support our farming clients. 
•	
Exchange Explore App – a free to use service 
available to any farm in the UK, that enables 
farmers to record their sustainability data. The app 
then provides recommendations for changed 
practices, including available funding from both 
public and private sources as well as accessing our 
Learning Hub
•	
Exchange Excel Consultancy – we have funded 
a select group of around 850 farmers to benefit 
from bespoke support. Their onsite farm 
measurements are completed by a dedicated SAX 
adviser and farm technician, who provide farmers 
with bespoke agricultural advice and offer ways 
in which farmers can be rewarded for farming 
with nature-positive methods
To ensure we analyse the whole farm, both tools focus 
on six impact areas: soil, water, biodiversity, carbon, 
animal welfare and social impact. This will help farmers 
unlock the benefits of sustainable farming practices 
while retaining a focus on profitable food production 
and capitalising on income opportunities. Recognising 
the essential nature of such data to the transition, we 
Implementation strategy
intentionally made the Exchange Explore App freely 
available online to any farmers – not just our own 
clients.  The Group is proud to offer the sector a blueprint 
for delivering the transition to a more sustainable future 
having launched ‘Grounded in evidence: A way forward for 
British farms’ 
 The outcome of our work with the SAX 
represents the largest and most comprehensive baseline 
of environmental farm performance in the UK and 
associated action plans. As the largest provider of finance 
to UK farming, around 850 farms have benefitted from 
Exchange consultancy. The resulting insights starkly set 
out the differences between farm types, both in terms 
of their current footprint, and the measures they could 
feasibly adopt.
In 2024, we have also expanded the use of our ESG Tool 
(see page 127 to 128) to support our SME agriculture 
clients. The bespoke assessment focuses on climate and 
broader environmental themes, helping us to understand 
the actions taken and challenges faced by clients in their 
transition. The outputs from this assessment will enable us 
to develop our approach in supporting clients’ transition.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Transition plan by system continued
Around 850 farms have benefitted from the SAX 
consultancy service through our partnership. One 
example is Shropshire arable farmer Sam Watson-Jones, 
who is rethinking his approach to profitable farming. At 
Howle Manor, near Newport, Sam is moving away from 
intensive agricultural practices to focus on improving soil 
health. The farm’s light, sandy soils are prone to flooding 
in winter and drying out in summer. A recent Soil 
Association Exchange baselining audit highlighted the 
potential benefits of increasing soil organic matter on his 
farm, where levels are currently low at 2.3-2.6 per cent. 
These benefits include improved water-holding capacity, 
nutrient mineralisation and enhanced biological activity.
Over the past decade, Sam has transitioned from 
ploughing to minimum tillage to reduce soil disturbance. 
He is now diversifying cover crops and experimenting 
with multi-species mixes to further enhance soil health. 
Additionally, Sam is exploring agroforestry and using 
chicken manure from his broiler unit to improve soil 
conditions. This approach aligns with his strategy to 
move away from commodity production and focus on 
higher-quality products for direct-to-consumer sales. 
Sam believes this shift is crucial because of the growing 
challenges in making a profit from farming, combined 
with the UK’s variable climate conditions, which puts UK 
growers at a disadvantage compared to countries with 
more favourable growing environments.
Risks and dependencies
There is a high degree of uncertainty about how the food 
sector will transition and reduce emissions to meet our 
target. We acknowledge the uncertainties associated with 
setting and delivering an emissions target in this sector, 
namely the poor data landscape and our dependency on 
factors outside our control, such as government policy, 
which will drive the sector’s transition. 
The willingness and capability of our farm clients to 
decarbonise their operations are key, while also 
acknowledging the financial pressures they face, as 
investment in improved agricultural practices may initially 
result in lower yields and require a longer payback period. 
Our strategy has a critical dependency on government 
action to incentivise and enable clients to identify, act and 
report progress through funding, guidance and regulatory 
activities. There are more details on our engagement 
strategy with the government on page 112. Key CCC July 
2024 Progress Report indicators are off track with the CCC 
estimating that £8 billion investment is required from 2020 
to 2030 to achieve net zero in UK sustainable farming 
and food. 
Increasing client awareness and education is therefore 
a foundational activity for decarbonising this hard-to-
abate sector. 
The effectiveness of mitigation options, such as adoption 
of appropriate regenerative farming practices, is dependent 
on farm-level characteristics requiring a bespoke approach, 
meaning scalability is a challenge. Recent technologies to 
improve precision and productivity are still in development 
and will require investment. 
It’s also important to acknowledge that the agricultural 
industry and nature are inextricably linked, putting 
farmers in the perfect position to drive environmental 
improvements. However, each farm business is different; 
they need tailored solutions that recognise the 
geographical, economic and technological challenges 
they face. Each business faces different external pressures, 
too, from retailers and processors introducing strategies 
to reduce indirect (scope 3) emissions, to accreditation 
schemes calling for specific targets to be met.
External engagement strategy
The CCC July 2024 Progress Report concludes that 
policies are not in place for driving the necessary pace 
of change (see page 112). Policy advocacy is therefore 
an important lever for this sector. We are using our 
voice through policy engagement with government 
and industry bodies to prioritise policy advancement 
in key areas including: 
01
Back a standardised methodology for measuring farms’ 
environmental impact.
02
Develop a decarbonisation and nature strategy for 
agriculture that sets out, in one place, how the UK will 
deliver productivity, profitability and sustainability 
improvements together.
03
Collaborate with industry to overcome the barriers 
faced by farmers – including around the flows of finance 
which can help deliver changes, and provide fair rewards 
in return.
We have continued to engage with all the political 
parties, pre- and post-election, including meeting 
with new rural MPs to highlight the importance of 
nature, sustainability, food production and resilience 
within the agriculture industry. In meetings with 
DEFRA, Natural England and the Treasury we have 
discussed our policy asks, which include the need 
for an industry decarbonisation strategy, unlocking 
the barriers to green finance to support farmer 
investment in environmental outcomes, and the 
importance of a standardised methodology for 
climate and nature measurement, reporting 
and verification.
Our active role in industry activities includes speaking 
at the Low Carbon Agriculture Show, Groundswell, 
The EU Regenerative Food & Farming Summit and 
The World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit. Our 
pavilions at the Royal Welsh and Royal Highland 
shows hosted several roundtables and events, 
including the Welsh launch of RABI’s Empowering the 
Worth and Wellbeing of Farming People initiative.
The poor data landscape in this sector also means we 
cannot currently track emissions reductions because of 
our actions. At present, we express our target in terms 
of absolute emissions reductions. In order to set a future 
intensity target we require improvements to internal 
and external data capture sources to be delivered. Going 
forward, we aim to further develop our ESG risk tool 
to capture client revenue and look to leverage external 
partnerships to improve our estimates of client emissions. 
Just transition
In line with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, we 
are committed to enabling a just transition that benefits 
our agriculture clients as well as communities, workers, 
suppliers and consumers. 
  
There are several factors affecting agriculture which 
include the impact of inflation on agricultural inputs 
since 2019, the current high-interest rate environment, 
and reduced labour availability post-Brexit1. Farmers 
have been grappling with inflation, rising energy costs, 
and fluctuating input costs (fertiliser and animal feed), 
creating uncertainty. They also face continued competition 
from cheaper imports. Agriculture is made up of smaller 
businesses, who have limited capacity to respond 
to these external factors.
To support the transition, we must consider how to 
help our clients overcome these challenges without 
adding to their already heavy workloads. This is a core 
consideration for us in developing any propositions 
to this sector. 
For example, through our actions on the Exchange Excel 
Consultancy, we have funded dedicated advisers to help 
around 850 farmers to baseline the climate impact of 
their farms, allowing them to evidence their credentials 
to their suppliers, and offering bespoke agricultural 
advice. Recognising the essential nature of such data 
to the transition, we also developed the free-to-access 
Exchange Explore App, which is available online to any 
farmer – not just our own clients.
SDG 15
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of 
terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, 
combat desertification, and halt and reverse land 
degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

of this can be found on page 103 of this report.
Our investments’ carbon footprint¹ is the principal metric 
for measuring our investment portfolio’s financed emissions 
and monitoring progress towards our targets. This metric 
is calculated from Scottish Widows’ Scope 3 financed 
emissions which are calculated from the Scope 1 and 2 
emissions generated from our investments or lending.
Our ambition
Align all our investments with the goals 
of the Paris Agreement, reaching net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner (from 
a 2019 baseline). To support this, we have 
set ourselves the following targets.
Our priority is to be a constructive partner in the 
transition to net zero and support our clients 
throughout their own transition journeys.

Carbon emission reduction ambition 
and targets
By aiming for gradual reduction in overall emissions 
contained in our investment portfolios to net zero by 2050, 
we are engaging with companies we invest in directly, and 
via our investment management partners, to encourage 
them to embark on decarbonisation pathways of a scale 
and pace needed to meet the global warming objectives 
of the Paris Agreement. 
The extent to which we can meet our 2030 target and 
2050 ambition is influenced by the pace towards net zero 
of the wider economy. However, our investment decisions 
on asset allocation, company exclusions and shareholder 
engagement are consistent with the transition to net zero 
in the real economy.
Our 2023 carbon footprint was 64.7 tCO2e/£m, down from our 2019 baseline of 116.1 tCO2e/£m. The carbon footprint 
has continued to decline from 2019 to 2023. Whilst investee company emissions have declined, most notably in 2020 
because of reduced production and energy usage during the Covid pandemic, company market values have increased 
by more in 2023 which has led to a further reduction in the footprint. Further details can be found on page 121.
Embark Group 
Since 2022, the Embark Group has been a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Scottish Widows and represents the interests 
of nearly 485,000 individual clients with c.£39 billion1 
of assets under administration (of which the Embark 
Investments Authorised Corporate Director has 
responsibility for c.£480 million), Embark manufactures 
wealth platform and pensions propositions for the retail 
brands within Lloyds Banking Group, for Scottish Widows 
and for other third-party brands.
Embark continues to develop its ESG approach to align 
with that of Scottish Widows in support of investors 
looking to make better-informed and responsible 
investment decisions. Within the packaged investment 
and pensions propositions Embark manufactures for 
Lloyds Banking Group brands, investment content 
is manufactured by the Scottish Widows Unit Trust 
Managers Authorised Corporate Director.

	 Indicator is subject to limited assurance by Deloitte LLP, for further details see page 03. 
As the carbon footprint is sensitive to 
market fluctuations in addition to the 
absolute value of emissions and our own 
investment activity, we expect to see 
short-term variation of the footprint and 
will be studying the medium-term trend 
from future reporting.
Embark Group recognises that the TCFD 
recommendations provide an important framework 
for stronger engagement on climate-related risks 
and opportunities with the management teams of 
companies represented in its investment solutions. 
There are additional ongoing efforts to providing 
financial advisers and customers who access the Embark 
platform with tools and information to foster greater 
awareness of where and how they can allocate capital 
to support investment in ways which represent their 
views on ESG matters.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Climate Action Plan (CAP): Progress update
Financing reduced emissions will be 
a key factor in supporting a global 
transition to a net zero carbon economy 
and having a world worth retiring into. 
Our first CAP was announced in early 
2022, with strategic actions to achieve 
our 2050 ambition of net zero across our 
full portfolio. We also have interim 2025 
investment and 2030 emissions 
reduction targets on the path to 
achieving our net zero ambition.
Product development and strategic asset allocation actions 
have seen Scottish Widows achieve both 2025 targets 
early. We exceeded our ‘at least £1 billion in climate 
solutions’ target in 2023; assets under management 
(AUM) as at end of 2024 was £2.1 billion. 
We also exceeded the upper range of our £20-25 billion 
target for investing in ‘climate-aware’ strategies, ending 
2024 with £25.9 billion. Finally, we continue to progress 
on our 2030 target to halve portfolio emissions versus our 
2019 baseline. At the end of 2023 (latest available date 
with emissions data) our in-scope AUM was £180.8 billion; 
our carbon footprint of this AUM was 64.7 tCO2e/£m 
invested. This is down 44 per cent from our 2019 baseline 
of 116.1 tCO2e/£m and down 16 per cent year-on-year 
(versus 77.4 tCO2e/£m invested in 2022). 
Intensity measures such as carbon footprint are appropriate 
to assess trends for continually growing asset bases such as 
Scottish Widows. However, to reach net zero, absolute levels 
of financed emissions must also fall, which we have seen in 
our portfolio at the end of 2023 versus end of 2022 (9.7 
MtCO2e versus 10.2 MtCO2e). 
Please note, as the carbon footprint is sensitive to market 
fluctuations in addition to the absolute value of emissions 
and our own investment activity, we expect to see short-
term variation of the footprint and will be studying the 
medium-term trend from future reporting.
Updating our CAP for 2025-2030
It is important to note that the existing CAP was 
developed in alignment with the IIGCC Net Zero 
Investment Framework, reflecting industry best practice. 
Our intention is to publish an updated Scottish Widows 
CAP in 2025 to reflect updated industry guidance, set new 
targets in line with how our business is developing and 
expand the scope of our plan to embed nature and social 
factors into it for a more holistic approach to net zero.
Principles for evolving the CAP 
Our intention is to evolve the CAP with the following 
principles guiding our approach:
1.	 Be aligned with how we are evolving our investment 
proposition (e.g. new default) and business
2.	 Take a more holistic approach to net zero that reflects 
the interconnectedness of climate with nature and 
social issues 
3.	 Focus on real-world outcomes to enable the transition 
with levers we have available to influence 
4.	 Be aligned with updated industry frameworks, including 
the Net Zero Investment Framework (NZIF) 2.0 and 
the UK Transition Plan Taskforce (TPT) guidance on 
transition planning for asset owners
5.	 Clear articulation of global warming trajectories 
we are currently on, dependencies on policy shifts, 
and incorporation of checkpoints
Target areas and considerations
We are currently considering four types of targets 
in the updated CAP: some new, some evolutions 
of existing targets. 
1.	 Emissions (evolve)
2.	 AUM (evolve)
3.	 Transition Alignment (potential new target) 
4.	 Nature (potential new target) 
Appropriate targets are dependent on how our proposition 
will evolve and will be underpinned by data analysis 
and AUM growth assumptions. 
Indeed, as we indicated in the original CAP, Scottish 
Widows will require real economy decarbonisation 
to occur alongside our investment activities to be able 
to reach net zero across our full portfolio. This is true 
for all our peers.
Actions pillars
To achieve our targets and transition objectives, we 
aim to have three main action pillars in the new plan, 
in line with our Responsible Investment implementation 
toolkit:
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued

Overview
Risks and 
opportunities
Climate-related risks and opportunities 
over the short, medium and long term 
As part of Lloyds Banking Group, Scottish Widows Group 
approaches climate risk management in a consistent way 
to the overall Group. Details of the Lloyds Banking Group 
approach, including definitions, and examples of risks and 
opportunities that arise in relation to climate change can 
be found in pages 154 to 157 of the Group’s annual report 
and accounts 2024 
 
More detail on how Scottish Widows Group recognises 
climate risk is set out on pages 136 to 137 of this report.
Identified risks 
As identified in pages 154 to 157 of the annual report and 
accounts 2024 
 climate risk manifests in two main 
categories: Physical Risk and Transition Risk, with the 
Group considering risks from the perspective of inbound 
risks, where the external environment affects the Group 
and outbound risks, the risks that the Group places on 
society.
In the context of Scottish Widows the main climate-related 
risks impacting insurance and annuities include:
The speed with which the wider economy transitions 
and the extent to which we align with this will affect 
the level of exposure we have to these risks. The time 
horizons during which these risks may manifest 
is uncertain. We have translated these risks into 
overarching risks impacting our business, and more 
details are on page 136. We use continuous risk 
management and qualitative assessments to help 
consider the materiality of these risks to our business 
which helps to inform the controls that we have in 
place to monitor and manage the risks.
Identified opportunities 
We believe that implementing our net zero strategy 
and our engagement activities highlighted on pages 119 
to 120 provides an opportunity for us to play our part 
in contributing towards change in the real economy. 
This not only enables us to help tackle climate change 
and nature loss as systemic risks and shape a more 
sustainable world to retire into, but also provides 
the opportunity to build more resilient investment 
portfolios in the long term.
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Scottish Widows continued
Mortality risk
Potential for people to die 
sooner than expected due to 
climate-related factors (e.g. 
temperature shocks and volatility 
or air pollution) resulting in 
increased life insurance claims.
Morbidity risk
Potential for people to become 
sick more often than expected  
or for longer than expected due 
to changes to climate (e.g. spread 
of vector borne disease, impact 
on resources or deteriorating air 
quality) resulting in increased 
critical illness and/or disability 
claims.
Longevity risk
Potential for reduced excess 
winter mortality due to warmer 
conditions.
Market risk
Risk of loss of value of 
shareholder or customer assets 
due to poor, late or costly 
transition by the companies we 
invest in; there will be winners 
and losers during the transition 
with more significant impact on 
those companies deemed to be 
less valuable in the new economy. 
Credit risk
Corporate customers who are in 
sectors specifically exposed to 
the transition will see potential 
disruption to business models, 
impacts from upward pressure  
on carbon-related costs and 
likely increased expenses as they 
try to adapt. This will lead to 
changes in their balance sheets 
that may ultimately increase the 
credit risk of lending to them. 
Litigation or 
reputational 
risk
Risk from not delivering on public 
targets and commitments or not 
clearly disclosing current position 
on climate or from poor 
management of customer/client 
exposures. 
Regulatory risk
Risk from not meeting existing 
and upcoming climate-risk-driven 
regulatory requirements. New 
climate-related regulation may 
be costly to implement and lead 
to additional processes, data and 
resources; diverging regulation 
across jurisdictions may add risk.
Market and  
credit risk 
The value of assets held by 
Scottish Widows will be affected 
by balance sheet performance  
of the underlying companies 
while government bonds values 
will be affected by economic 
performance. Damage and 
revenue disruption from extreme 
weather events could erode 
value on a short or long-term 
basis depending on the hazard 
type and the impact on the

Our Group strategy
Overview
Partnerships, initiatives 
and collaborations 
Our active participation in 
partnerships and collaborations 
fits into our goal to support and 
encourage greening across the real 
economy, beyond solely achieving 
a green investment portfolio. 
Corporate engagement 
During 2024 we continued to engage with corporates 
directly. As previously outlined we have created our own 
assessment framework combining indicators from Climate 
Action 100+ (CA100+), Transition Plan Taskforce and the 
International Labour Organization, and industry-specific 
indicators from the Accelerate Climate Transition (ACT) 
Initiative and Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 
These include targets for carbon reduction, commitment to 
embed climate considerations into executive reward, and 
whether the businesses had developed a policy or programme 
to reduce their impact on biodiversity and deforestation. 
Based on the CA100+ benchmark assessments, where 
companies were still missing a selection of the expectations 
set by CA100+, we voted against the management of some of 
the companies we had engaged with. We followed these up 
with further letters to the companies explaining why we had 
voted against management and repeating our expectations 
for these high-emitting companies. At the end of 2023, we 
co-filed a resolution at Shell Plc’s AGM to support the 
company to align its medium-term emissions reduction with 
the goal of the Paris Agreement. Further details can be found 
in the Scottish Widows’ Responsible Investment and 
Stewardship Report 2024, which will be published later 
this year. The 2023 report can be found here 
Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) 
As asset owners and supporting member signatories, 
we have continued to publicly support the goals of 
the initiatives of CA100+ and have used the net zero 
benchmarks in our own engagement activity. We have been 
involved in several communications to companies as part 
of the CA100+ initiative, as well as participating in meetings 
with companies on their climate strategies. 
Industry initiatives
Institutional Investors Group on Climate 
Change (IIGCC)
The IIGCC is the European membership body for investor 
collaboration on climate issues, with more than 400 
members representing $65 trillion of assets. 
Our IIGCC membership is one of the most important 
elements of our industry-level responsible investment 
activities. The following provides a summary of our key 
activities with the IIGCC during 2023 and 2024.
Scope 3 GHG Emissions Project Group
Inclusion of Scope 3 (value chain) GHG emissions into 
calculations and portfolio target setting with respect 
to net zero remains a key challenge for the investment 
industry. In the second half of 2023, the IIGCC convened 
a project group to develop guidance for investors 
to address their Scope 3 portfolio emissions. The 
collaboration concluded during 2024. The two key 
deliverables from this group were: a Discussion Paper 
 
in Quarter 1 of 2024 that identified specific material 
challenges for investors with respect to addressing 
Scope 3 emissions; and a subsequent Supplementary 
Guidance report 
 to provide good practice examples 
and practical solutions to those challenges, published 
in Quarter 4.
We continue to contribute to the development, 
review, and ultimate communication of guidance for 
other asset classes.
Net Zero Voting Guidance and Asset Owner 
Stewardship Working Group
We continue to contribute to the Asset Owner 
Stewardship Working Group, that allows for 
collaboration and best practice sharing among asset 
owners on climate-related matters. In early 2024, IIGCC 
published its Net Zero Voting Guidance, as a follow-on 
from the Net Zero Stewardship Toolkit developed in 
2022, to support asset owners and investment managers 
to develop their own net zero voting policies and 
practices. The guidance highlighted a principles-based 
approach, giving examples of how different investors 
were using the full range of resolutions and options 
available to shareholders in seeking to secure real-
world emission reductions. 
Transition to net zero and protecting nature continued
Scottish Widows continued
Scottish Widows recognises 
that we can be most effective 
through collaboration, and we 
continue to work with other 
external bodies, organisations 
and initiatives pursuing 
responsible investment and 
climate-related policy or 
advocacy initiatives.
While we recognise that collaboration is important, Scottish Widows will 
always retain its independence of thought and action in respect of our 
responsible investment activities.
A new, unique strategic 
partnership with Robeco
Scottish Widows has announced a new 
strategic partnership with sustainable 
investing leader Robeco to take its 
responsible investment approach to the 
next level. The focus of the partnership 
will be on two initial priorities in 2025. 
Firstly, to co-design and create new 
customised equities indices, with 
responsible investment principles 
integrated. 
Using Robeco’s specialist frameworks 
and expertise, the indices will be exclusive 
to Scottish Widows and feature ESG 
tilts underpinned by the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals as well 
as a range of forward-looking climate 
measures, with Scottish Widows’ 
exclusions policy also applied in full. 
The bespoke Robeco-Scottish Widows 
indices will be deployed across Scottish 
Widows’ investment offering for UK 
pension savers, with responsible investing 
fitted as standard. 
Secondly, we will work closely with 
Robeco’s sustainable investing centre 
of excellence on research and analysis 
related to our priority themes, such as 
climate and nature, and leverage their 
excellent frameworks to enhance our 
approach, including the development 
of our Climate Action Plan.

Overview
UK Asset Owner Council
We remain active participants of the UK Asset Owner 
Council (formed in 2024 through a merger of the UK Asset 
Owner Responsible Investment Roundtable and 
Occupational Pensions Stewardship Council (OPSC)). 
Scottish Widows played a significant role in roundtable 
discussion supporting its then Chair, Faith Ward, to publish 
academic research, conducted by Dr Andreas Hoepner, to 
investigate whether asset owners and investment managers 
were aligned in their proxy voting. The research reviewed 
investor voting activities in the oil and gas sector and the 
gap between asset owners’ expectations and investment 
managers’ voting activities. It highlighted the varying 
degrees of misalignment between the two, with stronger 
discrepancies noted in relation to voting on resolutions 
related to US-based oil and gas issuers. This indicated that 
some managers may be regarding voting and engagement 
on ESG matters as mutually exclusive. 
The research provided evidence to initiate constructive 
dialogue between asset owners and investment managers, 
kicking off with a roundtable in October 2023. It has also 
prompted interest from the wider industry, including the 
regulators, on this issue. The next step is for the Council 
working group to support UK asset owners in clearly 
articulating their stewardship expectations and aims 
for asset managers, including relating to managers’ 
stewardship approaches, decisions and voting rationale. 
Scottish Widows continues to remain closely involved 
in this ongoing exercise.
UK Sustainable Investment and Finance 
Association (UKSIF) 
As a member of the public policy influencing group 
UKSIF since 2021, we have contributed to its forums and 
consultations to drive industry best practice and advance 
the regulatory and policy agenda for creating well-
functioning markets, embracing and embedding a 
sustainable, long-term outlook. 
Alongside several other financial institutions and UKSIF, 
we wrote to the Prime Minister in August 2023 expressing 
concern at the government’s public statements and policy 
signals regarding net zero. This could undermine confidence 
in the UK’s commitment to meeting its medium- and 
long-term net zero goals, and we urged the government 
to provide long-term policy certainty on issues like carbon 
pricing mechanisms, transition to electric vehicles, and 
improving energy efficiency standards for housing. 
The letter noted that the finance industry can help drive 
capital towards innovative companies and infrastructure, 
delivering prosperity and creating jobs, also aligned to 
ambitions of the Chancellor’s Mansion House speech. 
We believe that to protect the UK’s competitive advantage 
as the world’s largest net exporter of financial services, 
purposeful and predictable sustainable finance policy is 
fundamental, and can help position the UK’s financial 
services sector as a global leader in green investment.
Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI)
We continue to leverage the data provided by the TPI to 
improve our engagements with our investee companies. 
The TPI delivers regular webinars, sharing with asset 
owners how the sectoral assessment methodologies it 
has developed can be used. We also used the TPI’s sector-
specific assessment methodologies in our communications 
with companies in 2023 and 2024, enabling us to develop 
sector-specific expectations we would like our investee 
companies to work towards.

Overview
Metrics 
and targets
Overview of financed emissions 
Our 2023 carbon footprint was 64.7 tCO2e/£m, down from 
our 2019 baseline of 116.1 tCO2e/£m. The carbon footprint 
has continued to decline from 2019 to 2023. Whilst 
investee company emissions have declined, most notably 
in 2020 because of reduced production and energy usage 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, company market values 
have increased by more in 2023 which has led to a further 
reduction in the footprint.
Note the assets under management (AUM) of £180.8 billion 
at year-end 2023 represents the total assets in scope of our 
headline net zero target. 
Further detail of financed emissions 
Our carbon footprint is a key indicator in helping us assess 
our progress against our net zero ambition. Although we 
also present weighted average carbon intensity, in line with 
developing industry practice and regulatory expectations, 
carbon footprint is still our preferred measurement of 
progress against our net zero ambition. The metrics and 
targets we monitor help to inform our investment strategy 
as demonstrated in our Climate Action Plan, namely the 
launch of our climate-aware investment strategies. 
For further information on these strategies, see the 
Climate Action Plan (CAP): Progress update section on 
page 117. 
Refer to the sustainability metrics basis of reporting 2024, 
available online in our sustainability downloads 
 for 
details on how our financed emissions metrics are 
calculated.

Emissions per £1 million invested is calculated using the market value of equity + book value of debt investment rather than the AUM in the table where assets are quoted at market value. The market value of equity + book value of debt equivalent total 
is £150.5 billion for 2023 (£131.5 billion for 2022). Note: coverage for weighted average carbon intensity may be lower than for carbon footprint due to lack of revenue data on certain asset types.

Weighted average carbon intensity expresses the portfolio’s financed emissions per unit of sales revenue of the investee companies.

Sovereign bonds
We are reporting emissions data on sovereign bonds for the 
first time in this report for the purposes of transparency, 
following the issuance by PCAF of methodology on 
sovereign debt in December 2022. PCAF notes that 
double counting of emissions of non-sovereign sectors 
(e.g. corporates) can occur due to accounting of emissions 
at sovereign territorial level, and that this therefore 
represents a challenge for an entity with multiple asset 
classes. PCAF also notes that this is not necessarily 
problematic if emission results of the different asset classes 
are clearly reported separately. Given these challenges, 
we will consider if and how we integrate sovereign bond 
emissions metrics into our targets.
Sectoral analysis of emissions 
The bar chart on the right shows a sector breakdown 
of the total financed emissions. This view is intended 
for illustrative purposes at this time and sector 
headings and the allocation of individual companies 
to sectors may be subject to revision as best practices 
emerge. Data is at 31 December 2023.

Scope 3 emissions 
Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect GHG emissions 
(not included in Scope 2) that occur in the value chain 
of the reporting company. Scope 3 can be broken down 
into upstream emissions that occur in the supply chain 
(for example, from production or extraction of purchased 
materials) and downstream emissions that occur as 
a consequence of using the organisation’s products 
or services. 
When it comes to Scope 3 emissions of the companies 
we invest in, at this time we do not feel the data is robust 
enough or has wide enough coverage for us to be able 
to set targets using it. We will continue to watch the 
developments in data quality and will consider extending 
our portfolio targets to cover Scope 3 of our underlying 
holdings when there is market consensus on the 
appropriateness of available data. We have expanded our 
reporting this year to include all sectors for which we have 
data (in the prior year report only oil, gas and mining 
sectors were reported). Please note that there is a high 
likelihood of emissions being double counted within the 
following Scope 3 tables. Companies are attempting to 
estimate all the emissions from the supply chain of their 
activities, so a company’s downstream emissions (the use 
of their products or services) may well be reported 
as another company’s upstream emissions (purchased 
products or services).
Further details on our approach to Scope 3 emissions 
reporting can be found within the sustainability 
metrics basis of reporting 2024, available online 
in our sustainability downloads

Our Group strategy
Overview
Nature
Nature-related issues can result in 
environmental risks with financial 
implications that matter for investors. 
From deforestation, to pollution and 
the unsustainable use of natural 
resources such as water, human 
activity is degrading the natural 
environment which provides the 
foundation for economies and 
businesses. 
There is also a growing focus on investment opportunities 
related to nature that can deliver return and help shape 
a more sustainable world in the long term. It is therefore 
critical that pension providers understand their exposure 
to nature-related issues and how they may impact their 
portfolios from two perspectives – the impacts they have 
on the drivers of nature loss and the dependencies their 
investments have on natural resources and the services 
they provide. 
Assessing our exposure to nature-
related impacts and dependencies
We have partnered with the Zoological Society of London 
(ZSL) to develop a process which provides us with insights 
on nature-related impacts and dependencies within our 
customer funds.
To conduct the assessment, we used Exploring Natural 
Capital Opportunities Risks and Exposure (ENCORE), 
a tool which supports an assessment at sector level 
on sub-industries considered impactful and dependent 
on nature. 
Looking at rankings based on the main drivers of nature 
loss, we were able to identify a range of sectors which 
consistently rank in the top three: pharmaceuticals, 
integrated oil and gas, electric utilities, as well as 
packaged food and meats.
Unsustainable use of water is a significant cause of nature 
loss. Accordingly, water use was selected as one of the five 
primary impact drivers that formed part of our assessment 
with ZSL. When looking at a selection of the top 1,000 
companies by holding size in our funds (representing 84% 
of our total corporate investments), water use is shown to 
be the highest risk for our portfolio as per scoring defined 
by ENCORE due to level of dependence and/or impact on 
water security. Furthermore, these findings revealed that 
50 per cent of companies assessed have a high to very high 
impact on water.
We have used the outputs of the ZSL analysis to help 
shape our initial sector priorities when it comes to 
engagement with companies we invest in and the wider 
industry. We will also engage on water use across a range 
of sectors and will carry out some further research on 
the issues identified. We will exercise our shareholder 
rights through voting to encourage companies to 
manage their usage of, and impact on, natural resources 
such as water.

Stewardship
With nature being one of our priority themes we have 
continued to actively engage with companies on their 
impacts on nature. We have continued in 2023 and 2024 
to be active participants in collaborative engagement 
efforts to drive industry change on nature. 
Nature Action 100
Nature Action 100 is a global engagement initiative mobilising 
institutional investors to establish a common high-level 
agenda for engagements and a clear set of expectations to 
drive greater corporate ambition and action to stem nature 
and biodiversity loss. The expectations outline six actions that 
investors call on companies to take related to the areas of 
ambition, assessment, targets, implementation, governance 
and engagement. Scottish Widows has been selected as a 
participating investor for three companies across chemicals, 
paper and packaging, and industrial industries. These 
engagements kicked off in 2024 with company meetings 
initiated. Broadly, the areas of focus selected across the 
companies included disclosure of nature strategies, 
biodiversity impact target setting, company lobbying for 
nature, the actions they are taking to reduce their impact, 
and how the companies are internally allocating the 
responsibility for managing their nature impacts.
PRI Spring
‘Spring’ is a UN Principles for Responsible Investment 
(PRI) stewardship initiative for nature launched in 
Quarter 1 2024, convening institutional investors to 
use their influence to halt and reverse global biodiversity 
loss by 2030. Spring aims to address the systemic risk 
of nature loss to societies, and the knock-on impact it 
has on long-term portfolio value creation, by enhancing 
corporate practices on forest loss and land degradation.
Scottish Widows sits on the Strategic Advisory 
Committee, providing guidance on the development 
and coordination of the initiative to support the PRI’s 
decision making. In 2024 we began engaging with three 
companies through the initiative, including one as lead 
investor focusing on deforestation-related activities. 
Farm Animal Investment Risk and Return (FAIRR)
We have been involved in several workstreams run 
by FAIRR throughout 2023 and 2024, as signatories on 
letters to companies across a range of themes, meeting 
with companies and attending site visits. The topics we 
have engaged on cover waste and pollution, working 
conditions, animal pharmaceuticals, protein diversification, 
restaurant antibiotics and sustainable seafood.
ShareAction Pesticides Working Group 
We joined ShareAction’s working group on pesticides 
at the start of 2024. The initiative aims to urge pesticide 
companies to steer their businesses away from negatively 
impacting biodiversity and towards supporting the 
transition to a sustainable global food system. The focus 
companies perform poorly on managing the risks their 
products pose to biodiversity, and they all produce 
numerous highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs), including 
many that have had high-profile environmental and 
human health impacts. We are looking forward to 
supporting the initiative and engaging with companies 
on this important issue.
World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) Nature 
Collective Impact Coalition
Scottish Widows is a founding member of this initiative, 
focused on company disclosures on nature-related 
impacts and dependencies.

Risk management is at the heart  
of creating a more sustainable 
future for people and businesses.
The Group is committed to protecting our customers, 
shareholders and colleagues while enabling 
sustainable growth. This is achieved through informed 
risk decisions and robust risk management, supported 
by a consistent risk-focused culture. Our ambition is 
to ensure that consideration of the key ESG risks 
facing the Group is embedded within our wider risk 
management processes to Identify, Measure, Manage, 
Monitor and Report on risk.
This section provides an overview of how we are 
managing ESG risk, with a particular focus on credit 
risk where progress is further advanced. We recognise 
the cross-cutting impacts of ESG risk across other 
risks such as conduct, people, operational and credit 
risk and are continuing to enhance our approach to 
consistently capture ESG considerations across our 
risk management framework.
One key area of ESG risk are the risks relating to 
climate change, which continues to be monitored 
as a principal risk within our Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework. 
Further details on management of climate risk are 
outlined in the annual report and accounts 2024, 
however, there are some areas where our activity will 
continue to evolve further before it is fully embedded 
within risk management. Accordingly, this section 
also includes further detail on our evolving activity 
to develop climate models and scenario analysis to 
support the measurement of climate risks.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Throughout 2024, we have enhanced 
and refined our ESG risk assessments, 
utilising our ESG credit risk taxonomy 
to ensure we are assessing and 
managing the material ESG credit 
risks to the Bank.
ESG credit risk 
taxonomy
ESG risk management
Our long-term intention is to embed consideration of 
ESG risks within our risk management for other risks.
However, currently this is at different stages across 
other risk types, with our approach towards embedding 
ESG risk within the credit process most advanced. This 
comprises various activities across the risk management 
lifecycle, including management of policies, risk 
assessments and scoring, portfolio management 
and counterparty-level case management, alongside 
controls and monitoring.
As well as the management of risks, this section also 
provides further detail on evolving activities to measure 
risks, focusing on climate risk analysis that is not yet fully 
embedded with the Group’s risk management processes.
The climate models and scenario analysis section 
includes analysis undertaken to understand potential 
impacts across general insurance, mortgages, social 
housing portfolios and commercial lending.
Scottish Widows’ specific risk management content is 
detailed within its own distinct section on pages 136 
to 138, recognising specific areas of focus and different 
stages in the development of incorporating ESG risks.
In 2024, we developed and implemented an ESG credit risk 
indicator framework at sector level which further supports 
our colleagues to incorporate ESG risk considerations into 
client conversations and risk assessments. By leveraging 
insights such as quantitative emissions data, industry 
standards like TNFD High Priority sectors and Global 
Canopy’s High Deforestation classifications, and qualitative 
sector insights, we can more effectively assess sector risk. 
The framework also supports the embedding of ESG risks into 
strategic decision making at a sector level and is considered 
when setting credit appetite. To support the decarbonisation 
of our portfolio the framework also considers progress against 
our NZBA sector targets, and will help influence the shape of 
our future portfolio and lending mix from an ESG perspective.
In addition, we have established net zero guardrails which 
form part of our ESG risk assessment and credit decisioning 
process. The guardrails outline key activities that support 
the transition, such as engaging with clients to verify the 
credibility of their transition plans, exploring financing 
for clean energy technologies, and performing enhanced 
due diligence.

Our Group strategy
Overview
ESG credit 
risk policy
Throughout 2024 we enhanced 
our ESG risk policy framework by 
broadening and deepening our client 
coverage and developing bespoke 
Climate assessments and dedicated 
Environmental and Nature and Social 
and Governance assessments.
These assessments help us to gain deeper understanding 
of our clients’ risks and opportunities, which helps us 
to deliver against our own ESG ambitions. 
In addition, for sectors with inherently high reputational 
risks, we have also developed a dedicated policy to control 
the Group’s credit risk appetite, ensuring enhanced due 
diligence is undertaken to manage the risks associated 
with operating in these sectors. 
Our ESG risk management process 
continues to evolve and enhance the 
existing credit assessment process. 
In 2024, we launched a consolidated, risk-based 
qualitative ESG risk assessment for our corporate, 
institutional, and mid-corporate clients using our ESG tool. 
These assessments encompass climate, environmental 
and nature, social and governance, and reputational risk.
Our assessments are risk based, required at origination 
and apply to both counterparties and transactions where 
appropriate. They are monitored on an ongoing basis 
throughout the customer lifecycle, including at specific 
risk trigger points.
We have defined ESG risk triggers to identify higher-risk 
cases, which are then subject to enhanced due diligence 
by our ESG risk specialists. Examples where enhanced 
ESG due diligence is required include cases that are within 
scope of the Equator Principles or where there are potential 
conflicts with our net zero guardrails or the requirements 
of our external sector statements 
￼
This process is integral to our control framework, ensuring 
that our lending complies with our ESG commitments. 
If concerns are identified during an ESG risk assessment, 
we will engage with the client or take mitigating actions 
to ensure the lending remains within risk appetite and 
aligns with our external commitments. See ESG credit 
risk case management for further details.
We continue to integrate outcomes from our risk 
assessments into our credit risk decision-making processes 
and consider these outcomes when setting sector or 
client-level appetite in certain cases. Where elevated ESG 
risks are identified in lending applications that require 
escalation, the ESG credit risk team conduct enhanced due 
diligence and summarise any findings/recommendations for 
the credit officer to consider in their credit sanctioning 
decision. This supports credit officers in ensuring our 
lending aligns with our appetite and allows them to 
consider recommendations from the ESG credit risk team, 
which may also result in the establishment of relevant loan 
conditions or covenants, such as those for transactions 
within the scope of the Equator Principles.
The number of clients completing an ESG risk 
assessment across Commercial Banking continues 
to increase.

Overview
Climate
Throughout 2024 we have continued to enhance our 
climate transition risk assessments within our ESG tool.
•	 We updated our assessment criteria, incorporating 
methodology from our Credible Transition Plan (CTP)
programme which follows the Transition Plan taskforce’s 
three core principles (for more detail see pages 85 to 87)
•	 We developed bespoke assessments and expanded our 
coverage to key net zero sectors: SME agriculture and 
SME commercial and residential real estate
•	 For SME clients outside of these sectors, we have 
developed a climate risk assessment, which we plan to 
launch in 2025
Environmental and nature
The Group recognises that nature potentially poses a 
significant financial risk for the UK. Following the completion 
of our ESG credit risk taxonomy in 2023, a materiality 
assessment classified environment and nature as a material 
ESG risk for the Bank. 
In 2024, we launched our first environmental and nature 
assessments for our corporate and institutional banking 
and SME agriculture clients, aligning with best practice 
guidance and recommendations to strengthen risk 
management and prepare for evolving regulations.
These assessments allow us to gather data on how our 
clients are responding to their nature-related impacts, 
dependencies, risks and opportunities, as well as allowing 
us to identify opportunities where we can support our 
clients in their nature-related transition. The initial 
integration of nature into the credit risk process is an 
example of how we are beginning to assess potential 
nature-related risks.
This year we improved our understanding of our potential 
exposure to deforestation and land conversion for our 
Commercial Banking and Scottish Widows’ Loan 
Investments portfolios. Through a desktop study using data 
sources such as Forest IQ and CDP, we assessed our clients’ 
exposure to deforestation, and how they are managing 
associated risks. Our findings supported the development 
of a new external sector statement on Forestry and 
Agricultural Commodities 
 The new statement details 
our approach to deforestation and land conversion. 
This includes new requirements and expectations for our 
in-scope clients involved with the following agricultural 
forest risk commodities in their direct operations and/or 
supply chains: palm oil, soy, beef and leather, timber, pulp 
and paper, rubber, cocoa and coffee.
 
Our environmental and nature risk assessment is a key 
control to ensure compliance with our external sector 
statement on forestry and agricultural commodities. 
Through the risk assessments, we gather information on 
our clients’ involvement with key agricultural forest risk 
commodities, whether they have obtained relevant 
memberships or certifications; and any operations 
located in countries with high deforestation risk. See 
Eliminating Commodity-Driven Deforestation Finance 
Sector Roadmap 
 We also use the risk assessment to 
confirm that clients’ direct operations are not associated 
with the prohibited activities outlined in the statement 
such as deforestation or clearance in protected areas.
Our most material areas, as identified through our
materiality assessment, are agriculture and the built 
environment. We are enhancing our understanding of our 
clients’ dependencies and impacts on nature, aligned to the 
TNFD LEAP approach. The ESG tool could be evolved to 
manage specific nature-related risks that are identified 
through a LEAP assessment.
Social and governance
We manage the social and governance risks associated 
to our clients through a dedicated assessment covering 
corporate, institutional and mid corporate clients. 
These assessments support adherence to our modern 
slavery and external sector statements covering issues 
such as: human rights and modern slavery, regulatory 
investigations, social washing, trade in high-risk goods 
and jurisdictions.
Reputational risk
Reputational risk is a key factor in our credit risk process 
and for our corporate, institutional and mid corporate 
clients, a specific reputational risk assessment is created 
dynamically based on the inputs to our ESG risk 
assessments which factor in climate, environmental 
and nature and social and governance considerations 
alongside the risks associated with the sector itself. 
For SME clients, specific reputational risk assessments 
are completed for clients operating in our higher risk 
sectors. Further detail on reputational risk is covered 
in the case management section.

ESG tool: climate insights
What is environmental and nature risk?
For our corporate coverage clients, 
insights from our climate risk assessments 
show continuous improvement in the 
percentage of clients taking action across 
key focus areas for managing climate risk, 
since implementing our ESG tool in 2021.
This can materialise as a: 
•	 Direct risk where, for example, the Bank could 
become liable for the remediation of a site if we 
were to take possession 
or
•	 Indirect risk where, for example, the borrower 
could be impacted by fines/inability to trade 
arising from pollution incidents or non-
compliance with regulation
In addition, this risk could also crystallise if a 
borrower was unable to meet the costs of evolving 
environmental regulation or remediation which 
may impact their ability to service debt or affect 
the value of security held.

Overview
Where specific or material environmental risks or 
concerns are identified, these may be referred to 
external risk consultants for an opinion on the adequacy 
of the mitigants in place or recommendations on 
managing the risk. The key findings from such due 
diligence are factored into credit applications and will 
be considered as part of the credit decisioning process.
We also recognise the heightened environmental, social 
and governance risks associated with activities in a 
number of sectors which we deem to be higher risk. As 
such, we ensure enhanced due diligence is undertaken 
for new/additional finance requests where material 
concerns are identified. 
Examples of our higher risk sectors are shown below.

ESG credit risk case management
As part of our ESG credit risk management framework, 
clients and transactions are assessed using our ESG tool 
which assigns individual risk scores. We use these score 
outcomes from the ESG tool to identify higher-risk cases 
that are subject to enhanced due diligence in line with 
policy by our ESG risk specialists. Where areas of concern 
are identified, we will engage with the client or take 
mitigating actions to ensure the lending remains within 
internal policies, risk appetite and our external 
commitments.
We ensure that ESG-related risks are considered for all 
Commercial Banking clients with whom we have a direct 
lending relationship, with specific commentary in new and 
renewal credit applications where total aggregated hard 
limits exceed £500,000 (excluding automated decisioning 
processes and digital or telephony applications for smaller 
counterparties).
ESG commentary and ESG tool thresholds are regularly 
reviewed to ensure ESG risks are effectively managed for 
each business unit.
Relationship managers are responsible for evaluating the 
clients’ activities in relation to the Group external sector 
statements, with controls built into our ESG tool to identify 
potential conflicts for enhanced due diligence. This process 
has been updated to reflect our approach to forestry 
and agricultural commodities, and requires relationship 
managers to consider and attest that our clients are in 
compliance with our external sector statements, with 
second line oversight provided by credit officers and our 
specialist ESG credit risk team where appropriate.
All cases escalated for reputational risk are approved 
by a designated business representative or legal entity 
accountable executive. Cases escalated for climate, 
environmental and nature risks are overseen by 
specialist teams.

Overview
The Equator Principles
The Group continues to be a signatory 
to the Equator Principles, which is a risk 
management framework for managing 
environmental and social risks in specific 
project finance transactions, such as large-
scale energy, industrial or infrastructure 
projects. It aims to ensure that such 
transactions, where the Group provides 
finance or advice, meet minimum standards 
for environmental and social due diligence 
and monitoring in keeping with responsible 
banking practices. Equator Principles 
transactions are subject to enhanced 
due diligence.
For transactions that fall within the obligations of 
the Equator Principles, the ESG credit risk team 
ensures the correct application of our internal ESG 
credit risk policies and procedures. This includes the 
review of environmental and social due diligence 
reports, or advising on specific requirements of the 
Equator Principles, and the review of any annual 
or ad hoc environmental and social compliance 
reports as required. 
For environmental risk including the Equator 
Principles we have external retained environmental 
consultants from whom we can seek additional 
advice or recommendations at a counterparty 
or transactional level.

Overview
Climate models 
and scenario 
analysis
Scenario analysis enables us to 
explore economic impacts and 
financial risks arising from climate 
change. This provides a way for 
us to assess potential implications 
of plausible future states under 
conditions of uncertainty, 
considering how the future might 
look if certain trends continue, 
or certain conditions are met. 
Internally, we follow a set of principles laying out best 
practice and key considerations when we undertake 
climate scenario analysis including determining use  
case, model selection, identification of credible  
external sources of data and governance.
Climate scenario analysis is important to the Group  
as it can help to drive alternative views and insights  
to inform how we manage the main risks. One of the main 
uses is in quantifying the impact of climate risk on our 
expected credit loss. 
Further information included in our annual report and 
accounts 2024 
 on pages 282 to 283. 
To help explain scenario choices, the four quadrant diagram 
based on the NGFS Climate Scenarios shows four high-level 
groups of scenarios based on higher and lower-risk 
outcomes dependent on climate policy and ambition. 
There are multiple scenarios within each quadrant; for 
illustrative purposes, we are showing only the seven current 
NGFS pathways that fit within these four groups. 
This is not exhaustive and other scenarios exist 
and are used.
The impacts in the scenarios are influenced by both 
the level of emissions and the choice of pathway. 
There is of course a wide range of possible outcomes. 
The orderly and disorderly quadrants currently have 
actions that reduce physical risk by limiting carbon 
emissions and the increase in surface temperature. 
The levels of transition risk vary depending on timing 
of action and socio-economic context of global 
cooperation and technological growth.
 
We consider the orderly quadrant as these scenarios 
are most conducive to achieving the transition, whilst 
disorderly narratives are also considered given the 
limited pace of transition witnessed to date. 
Our analysis shows that there tends to be higher 
transition risk in the latest Orderly and Divergent 
scenarios compared to previous iterations, with the 
increase varying by scenario and sector. This increased 
transition risk arises because the world did not reduce 
emissions in line with previous pathways before 2024 
and the scenarios in this report require a more rapid 
decarbonisation to achieve the same aggregate net 
emissions by 2100. 
The hothouse quadrant does not have material actions 
to limit emissions but we would expect to see higher 
increases in surface temperatures and the impacts 
of physical risk. 
We consider the impacts of increasing events e.g. floods 
on mortgage and household insurance books driven 
by chronic (e.g. rising sea levels) and acute (e.g. storm 
damage) hazards. Although we expect an adverse overall 
economic outcome, we consider quantification of the 
economic impacts of physical risk to be speculative 
at this stage. 
The too little, too late quadrant is currently the least 
explored and where modelling is least advanced.
Risk management continued
Scenario pathways 
Climate scenario analysis covers carbon emissions 
but other aspects of sustainability, and their 
interaction with climate change, are not currently 
addressed in our approach. The scenarios are 
characterised by their overall levels of physical and 
transition risks see page 50 of our annual report 
and accounts 2024 
 for definitions. Each scenario 
explores a different set of assumptions about how 
climate policy, technology, emissions and 
temperatures evolve. We consider a range 
of forward-looking climate projections and 
methodologies, including: 
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) – 
projected socio-economic global changes up to 
2100, as defined in the IPCC Sixth Assessment 
Report on climate change in 2021. It influences 
greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate 
adaption in scenarios with different climate 
policies. 
Representative Concentration Pathways  
(RCPs) – multiple pathways of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions and atmospheric 
concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land 
use covering a range of mitigation scenarios 
with varying degrees of stringency.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Application of scenario analysis 
Scenario analysis is by its very design subjective. We 
consider a wide range of scenarios and metrics to support 
our understanding of climate risk and to support decisions. 
Whilst we consider the approaches we take to be 
reasonable, we must recognise that there is a relatively 
wide margin of uncertainty in these impacts. Our model 
outputs are indicative rather than definitive and we must 
treat them with appropriate caution. While climate science 
itself is very well developed, determining the economic 
impacts of climate change is problematic and the margin of 
uncertainty in any translation of climate risk into economic 
impacts is wide. Modelling of this type therefore is only one 
of several components of our climate risk management 
process and is not acted upon in isolation.
We have identified interest in similar scenarios across 
multiple parts of the Group, and where appropriate and 
feasible have undertaken joint analysis to understand 
potential impacts estimated by different models that are 
directionally aligned. Changes in physical risk could impact 
residential properties across the UK, which in turn could 
affect several activities including our general insurance, 
mortgages, social housing portfolios and commercial 
lending to property developers, amongst others. 
The following sections summarise analysis of physical and 
transition risk across our most material homes, Commercial 
Banking and investment portfolios. 
Homes physical risk
It is important that we understand the potential extent  
of future physical risks for our UK home mortgage portfolio, 
our UK home insurance portfolio and the interaction 
between the two. A key risk to our UK home mortgage 
portfolio is the future availability of UK home insurance, 
particularly with Flood Re due to end in 2039. 
The extent of future changes in weather risks is highly 
uncertain and is dependent on several factors including 
environmental conditions and the actions of policymakers. 
Flood risk
For both portfolios we have looked at different climate 
scenarios for flood risk. The general insurance scenario 
analysis and mortgage scenario analysis showed that the 
largest increase in flood risk is seen in the hothouse 
scenario. Large increases in the cost of damage are seen 
for both inland flood and coastal flood risk. The main driver 
of this increase is that warmer air can hold more moisture, 
increasing the level of precipitation. Combined with rising 
sea levels, the level of flood risk increases considerably. 
Even in the orderly and divergent scenarios, where 
increases in the surface temperatures have stabilised by 
2100, sea levels could continue to rise, increasing the risk 
from coastal flood. There is significant regional variability 
in flooding impacts, and it should be noted that most 
properties are not materially impacted by flood risk.
Flood risk is likely to lead to the most material changes in 
risk to residential properties within the UK in the scenarios 
considered. Investment in flood defences along rivers and 
coastal defences, along with improved urban drainage 
systems, could help to mitigate some of the increased risk. 
Extending the Flood Re scheme beyond the current end 
date of 2039 could potentially support the continuation 
of insurance provision to properties at high risk of flooding, 
particularly under scenarios where the increase in risk of 
flooding is high. Improving building standards could also 
increase the resilience of residential properties to 
heightened physical risk. 
1-in-100 year flood risk (mortgages)
In support of the development of ISSB requirements to 
disclose 1-in-100 year flood risk metrics, we have assessed 
the volume and lending of our mortgage portfolio, which is 
summarised in the table showing that c.4.67 per cent of 
our properties are within 1-in-100 year flood zones.
In undertaking this analysis, and interpreting the future 
ISSB requirement, we have applied several design decisions 
and determined specific parameters or definitions where 
there is an area of ambiguity or lack of standard industry 
definition. These are summarised in the table on the right.
We welcome the development of disclosures focused on 
insights to flood risk and are keen to see how this evolves. 
The analysis is provided in readiness of the ISSB 
requirements; however, we are mindful that this metric in 
itself is not how we, or the industry currently measure flood 
risk. The following limitations should be considered when 
viewing this metric: 
•	 Probability is considered but impact only partially 
considered via minimum flood depth
•	 Industry access to flood defence data differs across 
UK nations
•	 All property types are currently included but further 
segmentation or treatments should be considered, such 
as flats on the second floor or above, or applying 
appropriate vulnerability functions
•	 The above analysis excludes properties that could not be 
linked to Twinn data due to inability to match address

Our Group strategy
Overview
Nevertheless, Rightmove has provided a benchmark of 5.42 
per cent for the volume-based metric on the UK residential 
property stock. This indicates the Lloyds Banking Group UK 
mortgage portfolio (at 4.67 per cent) is at slightly lower 
than average flood risk according to this metric, which is 
consistent with the conclusions from benchmarking based 
on Twinn (a company of Royal HaskoningDHV) scores that 
we have published in previous reports.
The table below shows UK mortgage lending by loan-to-
value (LTV) band, and geographical region for 1-in-100 year 
flood metric and also by Twinn present day (combined, 
defended) flood score > 60 identifying those properties 
at high/very high risk. This provides much more meaningful 
insight into flood risk and is based on a blended view across 
multiple return periods, not the 1-in-100 flood depths 
alone. 
This table demonstrates that in most regions of the UK, 
the mean LTV for properties with high or very high flood 
risk is in line or marginally lower than the regional portfolio 
mean LTV. This is broadly also true for the population with 
a 1-in-100 year flood depth of at least 25cm, with the 
notable anomaly for Scotland. Flood risk is managed 
at origination with properties exposed to increased flood 
risk requiring a physical inspection; we do not lend on 
uninsurable properties.
Subsidence
General insurance scenario analysis showed in a hothouse 
scenario subsidence risk is expected to increase, in 
particular in the south-east of the UK due to hotter, drier 
summers leading to more ground movement in the heavy, 
chalky soils. Early analysis of the mortgage portfolio 
indicates a similar conclusion.
Coastal erosion
For the table on the right, we have liaised with both 
Rightmove and Twinn to further refine and benchmark our 
metrics for exposure to coastal erosion across our mortgage 
portfolio. In this example, we have held our September 
2024 portfolio static and selected an end-of-century view 
in a hothouse scenario (RCP8.5) as a worst-case stress. 
The Group population involved continues to be limited to 
properties within 1km of the coast, and we now also quote 
this population as a proportion of the full UK (excluding 
Northern Ireland) mortgage portfolio. 
The benchmarking on the right demonstrates we have 
a lower proportion of our portfolio within 1km of the 
coast than the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) average. 
Moreover, that sub-population still has a lower than 
average exposure to coastal erosion risk, which we 
continue to monitor. We note the latter metrics are now 
based on 2100 timepoint, hence slightly elevated versus 
last year’s published metrics (based on 2095 timepoint).
The Environment Agency is updating its National Coastal 
Erosion Risk Map (NCERM) in phases. We are liaising with 
Twinn on when the results of NCERM2 can be leveraged 
in our physical risk data and the impacts it could have on 
our current estimates.
Potential impacts
From a general insurance perspective, the change in weather 
risks could affect the cost of damage resulting from 
weather events which could have a subsequent impact on:
•	 Underwriting risk appetite: i.e. the type and location  
of properties that are insured 
•	 Product design: this may need to be considered, 
for example, differentiating customer excess by 
weather risk type, or certain risks may not be covered 
for a policy in a particular area 
•	 Insurance premiums: increasing cost of damage may 
lead to higher premiums 
•	 Reinsurance: the cost of reinsurance could increase, 
reflecting the increased cost of damage. The availability 
of reinsurance could also be affected by increased 
frequency and severity of worldwide weather risks 
From a UK home mortgage perspective, we are mindful of:
•	 Increasing insurance premiums affecting mortgage 
affordability
•	 Being unable to lend where insurance coverage is 
not likely to be available for the full mortgage term
•	 Flood Re ceasing in 2039, which is within the term 
length for existing and new mortgages 
•	 Mortgage prisoner risk if all lenders start declining the 
same groups of geographically concentrated properties
•	 Stranded assets and potential devaluation due to 
all of the above

Homes transition risk
Residential real estate climate impact model
We have implemented the transition risk component  
of an internally developed residential real estate climate 
impact model. This is a portfolio stress-testing model, 
which quantifies the impact of physical and transition  
risks for our UK mortgages portfolio. We have used this to 
explore the potential customer affordability and property 
valuation impacts for a range of scenarios with differing 
stringency and timing of future EPC standards and levels of 
government support to conduct the necessary retrofitting 
actions. This has been used in our IFRS 9 Impairment 
judgements, please see pages 282 to 283 of our annual 
report and accounts 2024 
 We are also exploring further 
use cases for this model including ICAAP.
Next steps
•	 Implement and use the physical risk component of 
our residential real estate climate impact model
•	 Further refine the transition risk component
Commercial Banking and investments 
physical risk
Models that seek to consider the economic impact of 
acute and chronic physical risks resulting from climate 
change continue to be a concern across the financial 
services industry. 
There is inherent complexity and uncertainty related to 
the interaction of climate-related risks under potential 
long-term climate change scenarios. It is arguable that 
for various reasons the economic impact of physical risk 
is understated from a range of inherent industry-wide 
weaknesses, for example, we make no explicit allowance 
for disruptions to supply chains or the impacts of 
tipping points.
These limitations are more significant in the commercial 
lending and investment portfolios and since there is no 
historical precedent to guide us, we must speculate on the 
impact of physical risk on economic output. We therefore 
consider quantification of the economic impacts of 
physical risk to be speculative at this stage. 
Commercial Banking and investments 
transition risk
The impacts in the scenarios are influenced by both the 
level of emissions and the choice of socio-economic 
pathway. The choice of socio-economic pathway alone, 
in the absence of climate risk, has better growth in the 
globally cooperative socio-economic pathway, SSP1, than 
continuation of current trends SSP2. This is because SSP1 
is assumed to have more coordinated actions causing a 
higher rate of technological development. 
We consider the impact of transition risk excluding physical 
risk and the socio-economic effects, relative to the 
counterfactual projections that do not recognise climate 
risk at all.
There are significant differences among the underlying 
sectors in both the SSP1 and SSP2 scenarios. This sectoral 
differentiation can be helpful in developing our investment 
strategy, especially when coupled with our view of the 
relative likelihoods of the scenarios and of the sectoral 
emissions profiles. 
In the impact of transition risk chart on equities, we 
focus on the impact of transition risk from governments 
introducing a carbon tax commencing from 1 January 
2024, that reduce carbon emissions to limit the increase 
in surface temperature to below 2°C at 2100 compared 
to preindustrial levels. We show broadly defined sectors 
for these scenarios, and limit our outlook to 2050. 
The chart is based on projected equity values at 2050, 
with currency movements hedged, compared to 
counterfactual projections. 
The sectors that are more sensitive to the transition to 
a low carbon economy are coal mining and gas (including 
gas utilities) and oil and manufacture of petroleum 
products. Our modelling suggests that in these scenarios, 
the impacts on these sectors can be similar in the short 
to medium term, but that in the very long term the 
impact is stronger in the current trends scenario. The 
ordering of the sectors in the chart would also change 
if we changed the term of the outlook or government 
policy actions. More granular analysis suggests that 
within sectors, there is a wide range of returns by region, 
and that this range can depend significantly on the 
underlying socio-economic context. Impacts within 
and across sectors can also be influenced by the 
climate transition plans of businesses.
The margin of uncertainty in any translation of climate 
risk into economic impacts is wide and the following 
should be considered when viewing this chart: 
•	 We model government policy to affect a transition 
by means of a single, simple tax on emissions of 
greenhouse gases, whereas actual policy would 
also involve regulations and incentives
•	 Climate scenario analysis covers carbon emissions 
but other aspects of sustainability, e.g. biodiversity 
and its interaction with climate transition, are not 
currently addressed
•	 While we consider the approaches we take to 
be reasonable, we must recognise that our model 
outputs are indicative rather than definitive and 
treat them with appropriate caution

Climate transition plans 
For our Commercial Banking portfolio, alongside developing 
internal models, we continue to use data from McKinsey & 
Company’s Planetrics solution to inform our views on 
climate risk. 
A bespoke model run has been produced, which 
incorporates firm-level published climate transition plans 
in the modelling of future NPV impacts in the NGFS Phase 
IV scenarios. In the chart, we have selected those firms 
with climate transition plans, modelled with and without 
climate transition plan effects in the Delayed Transition 
NGFS scenario. 
We also state the climate transition plan coverage in 
brackets for each sector, i.e. the proportion of firms from 
the wider McKinsey & Company Planetrics modelled 
universe in that sector that have a published climate 
transition plan.
There are many points to note, including:
•	 Climate transition plan coverage varies by sector 
(ranging from over 50 per cent for utilities to under 10 
per cent for other construction) and some sectors have 
been dropped from the chart, though not our internal 
analysis, due to low absolute volumes of firms with 
published climate transition plans. We have also 
assessed on a sub-sector basis where needed (e.g. 
Passenger versus industrial transport) to identify 
differing trends
•	 The credibility of these individual climate transition 
plans have not been assessed as part of this analysis
•	 This analysis does not explore the counterfactual 
scenario of these firms investing significantly in 
transition activity but the wider global narrative is lack 
of transition (i.e. a hothouse scenario). Such firms would 
then suffer versus their competitors due to depleted 
capital expenditure and reduced market share from 
passing on increased costs to their customers
•	 This is a bespoke configuration of the model which 
we do not expect to be regularly refreshed
Nevertheless, the analysis indicates that if the published 
climate transition plans of the firms were implemented, 
there could be significant NPV benefits in many sectors 
under a scenario with strong decarbonisation such as 
the Delayed Transition scenario. Greater numbers of 
firms disclosing their emissions and climate transition 
plans in finer granularity, especially in sectors with low 
coverage, would help us better understand the potential 
benefits and opportunities which can facilitate the 
transition to a net zero economy. Increased policy 
certainty from governments and regulatory bodies 
would also help firms in planning and committing to 
climate transition plans. We also continue to develop 
our internal processes for assessing the climate transition 
plans of our clients.
Climate transition plans referred to here are taken 
directly from the Planetrics solution, used for modelling/
scenario analysis. See page 85 for details of our Credible 
Transition Plan programme, which is the internal 
approach engaging corporate clients on their transition 
plans and supporting their decarbonisation ambitions.
Other activity 
We continue with other activities such as using a climate 
sectoral GVA model in Commercial Banking ECL PMA 
considerations (see page 283 in the annual report and 
accounts 2024 
), and comparing the outputs of various 
modelling approaches to better understand the 
uncertainties and weaknesses involved.
Next steps
•	 Analysis of the impact of climate and 
environmental risk on the economic and financial 
system is in its infancy and we will continue to 
monitor industry developments and assess any 
enhancements we can adopt in line with 
development of measurement technologies and 
analytical methodologies 
•	 Continue collating and assessing client climate 
transition plans, and applying them to our 
in-house modelling

Our Group strategy
Overview
Risk management continued
Within Scottish Widows Group, we 
recognise climate risk as a principal  
risk within our Enterprise Risk 
Management Framework (ERMF). 
We recognise the cross-cutting 
impacts of ESG risk across other 
risks such as insurance underwriting, 
market, conduct and credit risk 
and are continuing to enhance our 
approach to consistently capture 
ESG considerations across our risk 
management framework. 
To strengthen ownership of climate and ESG risks, a new 
ESG operating model was developed in early 2024 to 
ensure ongoing alignment with the Scottish Widows 
Executive roles and responsibilities. We are continuing  
to embed this model into our usual business operations, 
in tandem with wider enhancements to our risk 
management taxonomy.
Within our risk management system (risk and control  
self-assessment (RCSA)), as well as mapping existing or 
new controls to our key regulatory obligations to identify, 
measure, manage and report the impacts of climate 
change, we have grouped our key risks into broad themes, 
which align to the Lloyds Banking Group’s definitions 
of ‘inbound and outbound’ risk impacts (for definitions 
of inbound and outbound risk please see page 150 of the 
Group’s annual report and accounts 2024 
).
The materiality of these risks is assessed via continuous  
risk management using the same impact likelihood matrix 
that is used for all of our risks, and will vary over time.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Risk management continued
Scottish Widows risk management continued
Assessment of risks
Our risk management framework aims to help us identify, 
measure, monitor, manage and report the financial risks 
related to climate change with regular reporting to the 
Board to enable timely decisions to be taken. Short-term 
risks and risks that have already crystallised are logged then 
monitored and assessed. This includes consideration of all 
risk drivers, including those relating to climate change, to 
ensure both inherent and residual risk ratings effectively 
reflect the exposure. As part of Lloyds Banking Group, 
Scottish Widows Group approaches climate risk 
management in a consistent way to our overall parent 
Group. We comply with the Lloyds Banking Group climate 
risk policy which is set around eight ‘principles’ and 
requirements, and we have developed our own insurance 
climate risk procedures to reflect insurance-specific 
practices and processes. 
ESG tool
We continue to apply the Group’s internal ESG tool at loan 
origination and as part of the annual review process. The tool, 
which focuses on both the inbound and outbound risks, 
assesses exposure and management of climate and ESG risk 
issues. These are overlaid with a transition risk assessment of 
the sector which has been analytically derived using emissions 
data, to produce scores reflective of the client’s climate 
impacts and exposure to ESG risks. The scores are included 
and discussed in specific ESG assessment and commentary in 
all our credit risk assessments. The ESG tool is owned within 
Group. Further details can be found in the ESG credit risk 
scoring and risk assessment section of this report on page 127.
Embedding climate risk within  
our risk management framework
Existing policy framework 
As a cross-cutting risk, climate change impacts will emerge 
through our existing risks. We have a Lloyds Banking Group 
Climate Risk Policy and Insurance Climate Risk Procedure 
which capture the overarching requirements for risk 
management, governance, scenario analysis and disclosure 
of climate risks. In addition to this overarching policy/
procedure, internal policies where climate risk impacts 
might be expected have been reviewed and where 
relevant updated, along with any related procedures 
and underlying processes. These include: 
Insurance: investment exclusions policy 
Introduced in 2020, this defines the rules for exclusions 
that will be applied to our investments. This policy, which 
works in tandem with the investment stewardship policy, 
defines our approach to public equities, bonds and other 
corporate debt and is supplemented by the Group external 
sector statements which apply to the direct lending part of 
shareholder investments. We have key controls around 
communicating this policy to our investment managers. 
Insurance: investment stewardship policy 
Also introduced in 2020, this defines the stewardship  
and engagement activity which we undertake in support  
of our Responsible Investment Framework and our 
commitments to: 
•	 Be responsible stewards of the assets we oversee 
•	 Influence investee companies to engender positive change 
•	 Exercise strong governance over the asset managers  
we partner with
It aims to protect and maximise the value of investments  
in the long term, in line with our beneficiaries’ interests, 
through encouraging investee companies to plan and 
evolve their activities responsibly, to deliver value through 
stable and sustainable returns. 
This policy was developed to meet the requirements of  
the FCA Policy Statement 19/13 (PS19/13) in relation to  
the Shareholders Rights Directive II (SRD II) (COBS 2.2B) 
and the FRC Stewardship Code. 
Insurance: investment policy 
This policy references the Responsible Investment 
Framework and that ESG factors should be considered  
as part of due diligence and assessment activity for 
investment strategy and transactional decisions. 
Insurance: reinsurance risk policy and procedures
As part of the assessment of new reinsurance 
arrangements, reinsurers’ exposure to climate risk  
should be considered in their approach to managing 
forward-looking climate risk.
Insurance: market risk procedure and insurance  
stress and scenario testing procedures
Climate stress testing is a requirement for regular  
medium and long-term strategic planning.
Lloyds Banking Group:  
insurance underwriting risk policy 
This policy requires that climate change is embedded  
in underwriting risk management processes including: 
•	 Incorporating the effects of climate change in the 
demographic risk register 
•	 Internal model development and improvement to 
incorporate the impact of climate change on both  
a short- and long-term time horizon 
•	 The weather modelling team conducts regular reviews 
of the impacts of climate change on weather risks 
considering the latest published research and model 
predictions of climate change
Lloyds Banking Group: product procedures 
The product review process requires that climate risk,  
in particular the associated conduct risk, is specifically 
considered at all stages in the product lifecycle. 
Lloyds Banking Group: credit risk policy  
and insurance credit framework policy 
For our loan investment book, we adhere to the Lloyds 
Banking Group credit risk policy which was updated  
in 2021 to incorporate reference to ESG risk, and the 
insurance credit framework policy, which supplements  
the Lloyds Banking Group policy and sets out the Scottish 
Widows Group specific approach to management of 
credit risk. As part of our credit risk assessment, both  
at origination and at annual review, we include a rating 
based on the output of the ‘ESG tool’, together with an 
assessment of the counterparty’s approach to ESG risk. 
Similar to our insurance investment exclusions policy, the 
Lloyds Banking Group external sector statements (which 
can be found here 
 under Group codes and policies) apply 
to our Loan Investments book and set out our approach  
to key sectors where we have a direct lending relationship. 
Risk appetite 
The risk appetite framework has been extended 
to  include specific climate risk appetite strategy, 
preferences and metrics. The Board approves a climate 
risk strategy statement expressing our preference 
to avoid risks arising from climate risk.
Climate risk is the risk that the Group experiences losses 
and/or reputational damage, as a result of climate change, 
either directly or through its customers. These may be 
realised from physical weather events, the adaptation 
required to transition to a low carbon economy, or as a 
consequence of the responses to managing these changes. 
We have no appetite to fail to proactively manage the risks 
and opportunities for our business as a result of climate 
risk. We will take action to support the Group and our 
customers’ transition to net zero, and maintain our 
resilience against the risks relating to climate change. 
We have aligned our risk preferences to our key risks,  
set out in the table on page 136. We have risk appetite 
metrics to help us monitor and report on key climate-
related exposures, progress towards meeting key net  
zero commitments (for investments), and to monitor  
the operation of key controls such as adherence to 
our external commitments framework.

How we deliver
Our Group strategy
Overview
Risk management continued
Insurance underwriting risk
Given the short-term nature of home insurance policies  
we are able to review our view of risks regularly, and  
change our approach as risks develop to mitigate long-
term exposure of climate risks. Our overall strategy is 
to continually review our acceptance criteria and pricing 
strategy for each risk based on both a short-term and 
long-term view. In-house expertise on physical risk is 
retained in the form of a dedicated weather modelling 
team. The team is comprised of specialists in hydrology, 
meteorology and probabilistic modelling who develop  
a baseline view of physical risk for the UK and conduct 
forward-looking climate stress testing on this.
This team has been in place since 2016 and has monitored 
and applied climate change science onto the view of risk 
used for capital, pricing, reinsurance and planning.
Financial management
An assessment of climate-related risks for general insurance 
liabilities is integrated into our insurance model governance 
process. Climate change is identified as a key topic for 
model review and approval within this process, and 
specifically, the appropriateness of the view of risk for  
the weather perils in the context of climate change science. 
This view of risk is integrated into assessments of capital 
requirements, reserving, reinsurance and pricing. It also 
feeds into the quarterly exposure management where 
insurance portfolio exposure arising from weather-related 
perils is monitored and controlled.
A third-party vendor model is used for the perils of inland 
flood, coastal flood and wind. The vendor model results are 
adjusted internally to better reflect our own exposure and 
experience.
Catastrophe modelling
The catastrophe weather model is a key component of the 
Scottish Widows Solvency II (as modified by the PRA’s 2024 
reforms) capital model. The results of the model by weather 
peril are used to inform the base rates for risk pricing. 
Accordingly, weather pricing models are used to inform 
how insurance premiums should vary across the book. 
The outputs are used to create a relative view of risk across 
the geographic domain of the book – i.e. how risk varies 
from location to location. The weather modelling team 
conducts a regular review of available research and models 
on climate change.
Key metrics
Many of our customers have been impacted by weather 
events in the last few years, specifically from events which 
have led to claims from inland flooding, coastal flooding 
and windstorm damage. Climate scientists predict that  
the frequency and severity of flooding could increase in 
coming years.
For example, sea level in the UK could rise by up to one 
metre by the end of the century. This size of increase  
would likely affect the frequency and severity of our claims 
experience. Being able to identify and monitor trends in  
the increased physical risks, through a variety of metrics,  
is therefore very important.
Weather pricing models are used to inform how insurance 
premiums should vary across the book. The outputs are 
used to create a relative view of risk across the geographic 
domain of the home insurance book. We assign properties 
risk bands to reflect the level of potential flood risk, with 
higher bands representing a higher risk of flooding. We can 
use this banding to manage our exposure in high-risk areas. 
Increasing the proportion of our portfolio in higher-risk 
bands could lead to significant increases in losses in the 
event of increasing severe events.
In addition, we monitor actual weather-related losses against 
expected weather losses. In the graph below, Severe weather 
losses, shows actual versus expected average annual loss on a 
net of reinsurance basis and covers inland flood, wind, coastal 
flood and freeze. Actual weather losses performed better 
than expected from 2020 to 2021 and from 2023 to 2024 due 
to relatively benign activity. However, due to the extreme cold 
weather in December 2022, in addition to small windstorm 
losses, actual weather losses for 2022 exceeded expected 
losses.
The expected weather losses is a long-term view, so there 
can be significant volatility depending on weather events.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Group roles, responsibilities and remuneration
Given the strategic importance of our 
sustainability ambitions in managing 
the impacts arising from climate 
change and broader societal issues,  
the Group’s governance structure 
provides clear oversight and ownership 
of the Group’s sustainability strategy 
and management of risks and 
opportunities. 
Sustainability-related responsibilities at Board level are 
overseen by the Responsible Business Committee, with 
specific reporting and risk management responsibility  
in relation to sustainability-related matters (including 
climate) shared with the Audit Committee and Board  
Risk Committee. This ensures appropriate Board-level 
coordination and cooperation on these matters. 
Climate risks and opportunities are identified,  
assessed and managed by business unit-level teams 
governed via functional and divisional-level steering  
groups and committees. For further details on the 
control environment operating at a business unit level 
for climate-related controls, see page 142.
 
Full details on how sustainability is incorporated into  
our Group governance structure along with key topics  
of discussion at the Board committee level are detailed 
on pages 88 to 89 within the annual report and accounts 
2024 
.
Entity governance
Beyond the Group level, governance structures are in  
place to support consideration of sustainability risks  
and opportunities at Board level across the Group’s  
key legal entities.
The Group’s governance structure focuses on ensuring 
independent decision making by the Ring-Fenced Bank 
Boards; the structure and responsibilities for the 
Ring-Fenced Banks are outlined on page 83 of the 
annual report and accounts 2024 .
In Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets (LBCM), regular 
updates on climate risks are provided to its Board and 
Board Risk Committee. Details of the governance 
structure within Scottish Widows is detailed in the 
section on the next page. 
Additional details on respective governance for the 
Group’s other entities can be found in their respective 
disclosures.
Divisional governance 
Group-level governance of sustainability risk is 
supported by existing governance structures across our 
divisions that are used to oversee decisions related to 
sustainability risk that impact the divisions, ensuring 
sustainability risks are managed as part of regular 
activity. 
Divisional governance structures include the Consumer 
Lending Executive Committee, Commercial Banking 
Committee and various executive bodies within 
Insurance, Pensions and Investments. 
Our Group Sustainable Business team is supported by 
divisional sustainability teams, ensuring a coordinated 
approach to oversight, delivery and reporting of the 
Group’s sustainability strategy.

Our annual balanced scorecard provides transparency on 
how our performance aligns with 2024 executive director 
GPS outcomes. It also informs the wider 2024 GPS pool 
for all colleagues and 2025 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
budget for our Group Executive Committee members. In 
2024, the weighting related to sustainability performance 
measures in the Group balanced scorecard was 20 per 
cent, continuing our focus on climate change ambitions 
and our ongoing commitment to improving diversity 
and engagement within the Group.
Sustainability measures included within our scorecard  
are as follows:
•	 Increasing our gender and ethnic representation  
in senior roles (7.5 per cent)
•	 Reducing our operational carbon emissions (5 per cent)
•	 Culture and colleague engagement (7.5 per cent)
Progress against our targets in 2024 is set out on pages 32, 
54 to 58 and 119 of the annual report and accounts 2024 
In 2024, we returned to a performance-based LTIP ensuring 
stronger alignment with our strategic objectives by supporting 
a high-performance culture and providing the opportunity 
to directly link long-term variable reward outcomes to the 
delivery of our strategy and the realisation of its benefits 
for shareholders. 15 per cent weight is attributed to 
environmental measures, reflecting that the transition to a 
low carbon economy is at the core of our strategy and aligns 
with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. The Committee 
will assess performance of the Group’s sustainable finance and 
investment commitments over the performance period, 2027 
progress towards its 2030 NZBA sector targets and delivery 
against Scottish Widows’ net zero ambition.

Overview
How we deliver continued
Scottish Widows governance
Governance for climate-related risks 
has been embedded into our existing 
governance structure, which is 
supported by the governance within 
the wider Lloyds Banking Group’s 
sustainability strategy. Key boards 
and committees meet regularly 
through the calendar year. 
The Insurance Board is the ultimate authorisation body  
for matters which concern the operation of Scottish 
Widows’ business and is responsible for establishing  
and promoting a culture of (among other things) an 
appreciation of climate and sustainability matters.
During 2024, Insurance, Pensions and Investments (IP&I) 
made changes to how it manages its responsibilities for 
sustainability matters. The responsibilities of the IP&I 
Responsible Business Committee (RBC) were mapped 
to successor bodies within IP&I’s governance structure, in 
order to enable sustainability matters to be appropriately 
governed as part of business-as-usual considerations.  
With its responsibilities mapped to relevant successor 
bodies the IP&I RBC was disbanded in 2024. Sustainability 
governance was mapped to existing Executive Committees, 
such as the IP&I Risk Committee, which monitors end-to-
end risk profile for the insurance group and the IP&I 
Investment Committee, which monitors performance of 
investment strategy (including sustainability). Exceptional 
matters, such as material external investment 
commitments under the external commitments framework, 
are approved by the IP&I Executive Committee. Individual 
members of senior management also accepted 
responsibility and accountability for sustainability risks 
and opportunities in their portfolios, supported by the 
insurance group’s support functions in risk and finance.
Insurance Board 
The Insurance Board has an overall responsibility to 
promote and assess the long-term sustainable success, 
safety and soundness of the IP&I business, generating 
value for Lloyds Banking Group as ultimate shareholder, 
and to contribute to the wider society and engage 
actively in the affairs of the IP&I business. 
This includes a requirement to keep abreast of material 
changes in IP&I’s business and the external environment, 
which includes climate-related issues, as well as acting in 
a timely manner to protect the long-term interests of the 
IP&I business. These responsibilities and certain matters 
reserved for the approval of the Insurance Board are 
set out in the ‘schedule of matters reserved’, which is 
reviewed annually, and informs matters for consideration 
and discussion at Insurance Board meetings. The 
Insurance Board met no fewer than eight times in 2024. 
The Insurance Board also undertakes an annual review 
of each of its committees’ purpose and responsibilities 
(terms of reference) and is kept informed at each Board 
meeting of key matters, discussed via individual 
committee Chair Reports. 
The Insurance Board also ensures that its composition 
is sufficient in aggregate knowledge, skills, experience 
and background to effectively debate and take decisions 
informed by an awareness and understanding of climate-
related threats and opportunities. Between them, the 
Insurance Board and IP&I management maintain regular 
exchanges and dialogues with peers, policymakers and 
other stakeholders to stay informed about the latest 
climate-relevant risks and regulatory requirements. 
To support the board, management assesses the 
materiality of climate-related risks and opportunities for 
the IP&I business on an ongoing basis and takes actions 
that are proportionate to the materiality of climate to 
the IP&I business. 
Insurance Board key decisions
The board is engaged (either directly or via its 
committees) on a regular basis on sustainability matters, 
receiving periodic briefings covering topical and horizon 
issues in relation to sustainability and other matters.

Skills and training
Board training
We continue to educate our Group Board members 
on sustainability matters. A specific training session was 
delivered to the Group Board on double materiality 
assessment, how it will support the Group’s understanding 
and prioritisation of sustainability issues and influence 
strategic decision making and assist us in fulfilling our 
future reporting disclosure requirements.
Colleague training
Our colleagues are vital to the Group in delivering on  
our sustainability ambitions and managing our risks  
and opportunities. During 2024, in order to upskill our 
colleagues we have delivered training across a number  
of areas, with a few examples called out below: 
1. Nature
We have developed training materials for all colleagues 
covering what nature is, the interconnectedness between 
nature and climate, why nature is important to business, 
impacts and dependencies of different sectors, the role 
nature plays in the transition to a low carbon economy  
and the Group’s nature approach. In addition, training  
has been delivered to specialist teams within Risk and 
Commercial Banking covering topics such as policy and 
regulation, nature markets, nature-related risks, nature-
positive finance and TNFD.
2. Modern slavery and human trafficking
We launched modern slavery and human trafficking training 
and made it available to all colleagues to help raise 
awareness and to help them identify how the issue impacts 
the Group and their role. The training provides an insight 
into our processes and policies to help mitigate this risk 
across our business and supply chain whilst highlighting 
the work we do to support survivors of modern slavery.
3. Commercial Banking 
Our ESG training seeks to empower colleagues to take a 
proactive approach in maximising value and impact for 
clients, as well as driving increased internal collaboration 
and sector-specific knowledge sharing. Since 2018, over 
4,800 instances of ESG training have been undertaken by 
colleagues. We have worked with a variety of the leading 
universities and institutions in sustainability such as the 
Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), 
the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC), Edinburgh 
Innovations and Exeter University, to provide foundational 
ESG courses that focus on sustainability, up to and 
including the design and development of advanced and 
sector-specific specialist training, such as our collaboration 
with the University of Edinburgh to develop a 22-week 
bespoke programme to drive our focus on transition 
technologies.
4. Further sustainability training launched this year 
to specific colleagues included: 
•	 An introduction to our Sustainability Financing 
Framework for relationship managers 
•	 ESG credit risk and the Equator Principles
•	 1,500 colleagues have been trained on the Technology 
Sustainability Framework which helps our engineers 
to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption 
and carbon emissions from technology use, reduce 
technology waste and water consumption. This helps 
to inform decision making when implementing new 
technology services
 
How we deliver continued
The Group’s structure provides clear oversight and ownership of our sustainability strategy and management  
of sustainability risk across the three lines of defence, with dedicated teams in place focused on these areas.
1st line
The Group Sustainable Business team is responsible for overseeing the Group’s strategic  
approach to responding to global and local issues on sustainability. 
At a divisional and/or sector level, sustainability teams within the business, support the delivery  
of our sustainability strategy in alignment with the Group strategy and our sustainability pillars. 
These teams combined are responsible for developing the Group’s response to sustainability risks 
and opportunities, including engaging with business areas to align sustainability to the business  
area strategies, ambitions and facilitate the development of sustainable product-level offerings.
From a climate perspective this includes activities supporting business areas in the calculation and 
forecasting of emissions, sector-level target setting and delivery against our transition plan to 
support the Group’s sustainability targets.
Group Finance is responsible for incorporating sustainability into the Group’s performance  
reporting, financial planning and external reporting.
2nd line
Risk is responsible for overseeing the risks relating to sustainability topics. This includes  
formal responsibilities in relation to oversight of the risks arising from climate change to  
support meeting regulatory expectations.
Teams across Risk are responsible for oversight of the Group’s sustainability strategy,  
as well as incorporating consideration of sustainability-related topics into the appropriate  
risk management processes. Activity in relation to climate risk is most advanced, including 
development of methodologies to quantify climate risk, oversight of net zero strategies and  
setting the Group’s climate risk appetite.
3rd line
Group Audit has a team focusing on ESG risks. This team, supported by other subject matter 
experts, provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board. Group Audit also 
attends key sustainability and climate risk governance committees and forums.

Our Group strategy
Overview
How we deliver continued
The Group does not tolerate anti-competitive practices 
noting that these could lead to interventions by competition 
authorities; or breaches of competition law, which may harm 
customers or have a significant financial or reputational 
impact on the Group. We recognise that competition law 
is not intended to stifle legitimate business while also 
recognising that we must deal in good faith with all our 
trading partners, including our suppliers and competitors. 
Avoiding market abuse 
We implement and monitor adherence with market abuse 
and personal account dealing procedures that are aligned 
with the UK’s market abuse legislation. Market abuse, such 
as trading based on inside information, is a criminal offence 
in the UK, the US and many other countries. Colleagues  
are personally responsible for ensuring that they comply with 
this policy and do not abuse the market. We have monitoring 
systems in place to detect instances of market abuse and 
procedures to ensure that any detected instances are dealt 
with swiftly and effectively. This includes procedures to 
identify and report suspicious transactions where relevant.
Product governance
A comprehensive Group product policy, procedures and 
framework is in place to define the guardrails for the 
business to meet the regulatory requirements and how 
we want to operate as a Group. The policy outlines core 
concepts which are considered throughout the product 
lifecycle including identifying the need the product is 
required to meet for customers in the target market and 
having controls in place to prevent the product from 
being offered to customers for whom the product is not 
appropriate. Colleagues are also supported to use their 
judgement to apply the policy requirements in a way which 
is proportionate and appropriate to the product and 
customer needs and the foreseeable harms. Through robust 
risk management, regular product reviews and monitoring, 
we adopt a continuous process to ensure that our products 
provide good customer outcomes. 
Development and continued oversight of the 
implementation of the customer vulnerability strategy 
remain through operating at a senior level to prioritise 
change, drive implementation and ensure consistency 
across the Group. More on our approach to supporting 
customers is available on pages 25 to 32.
Scottish Widows approach  
to incorporating social factors
Where we believe sustainability factors pose downside risks 
to investments, offer potential upside opportunities and 
support a better world to retire into, we will continue to 
incorporate them into our decision making. Social factors, 
such as labour rights, are central to the societal infrastructure 
which the global economy relies on for delivering sustainable, 
long-term growth. As long-term investors and universal 
owners, we are increasingly aware of how systemic ESG risks 
may impact our investment portfolio and are working to build 
our understanding of the different risks. 
Our work on social factors is underpinned by research 
including recommendations made by the Taskforce on 
Social Factors and implemented through exclusions, 
integration and stewardship. Stewarding assets on social 
issues is of crucial importance to influence positive change 
in the economy and ultimately for our pension customers. 
It contributes to the wider Lloyds Banking Group purpose 
of Helping Britain Prosper.
Currently we are focusing on three overarching social 
themes:
•	
Human rights
•	
Human capital management 
•	
Diversity, equity and inclusion
As part of our focus on human rights, gender equality is a  
key consideration for Scottish Widows. As a pension provider 
we have delved into how deep-rooted, structural inequalities 
cause women to earn less, work less and save less for 
retirement when they become parents.
Our role as an investor enables us to tackle some of the 
structural inequalities and raise awareness of the issue. Our 
approach to gender and diversity is well established and 
aims to effect real-world change. We engage with boards 
of companies to encourage gender representation and 
payment of the living wage as we know low pay 
disproportionately affects women. As asset owners, we 
have an important role to play in helping to address 
wealth inequality by helping people, no matter their 
income level, grow their wealth through a pension that is 
invested in capital markets. It’s core to our purpose of 
Helping Britain Prosper.
For more information, please see Scottish Widows  
Our approach to social factors 
Consumer Duty
The FCA’s Consumer Duty Regulations set higher and 
clearer standards of consumer protection across financial 
services, requiring firms to put their customers’ needs first.
 
As an organisation, we are already focused on the delivery 
of good outcomes for our customers – Consumer Duty is 
the next step in the evolution of how we do this and will 
drive broader cultural change. There will be greater focus 
on the outcomes customers receive – whether products 
and services meet customer needs and offer fair value, if 
customers understand the information provided to them 
and if customers are given the support required to meet 
their financial objectives. 
 
We have robust governance in place, under delegated 
authority from the Board, to provide oversight of the 
ongoing consideration of Consumer Duty across the 
Group, with the Board Risk Committee overseeing 
related risks. The Board was engaged on the Group’s 
implementation of Consumer Duty, including agreeing 
with the steps the Group has taken to meet the 
requirements of the regulation. The Group also 
appointed two Consumer Duty Champions who will help 
ensure Consumer Duty is considered in senior leadership 
strategic discussions. In addition, the Group continues 
to work closely with the FCA on the ongoing embedding 
of the duty and sharing of best practice across the 
industry.
We believe that conducting our business 
responsibly means operating sustainably 
and inclusively; meeting our legal 
requirements; and always considering  
our impact on our customers, colleagues, 
society and the environment.
Product development
Our Group customer and product policies set out how 
important it is to ensure that we are delivering good 
customer outcomes. 
•	 Everyone in the Group must focus on the outcomes  
we want to deliver for customers and to ensure that 
evidence and monitoring is in place to assess whether 
we have provided good outcomes, avoided foreseeable 
harms and supported customers in pursuing their 
financial objectives
•	 We must act in good faith towards customers which  
is characterised by honesty, fair and open dealing  
and acting consistently with the reasonable 
expectations of customers
•	 We must ensure that our products offer fair value  
to customers
Taking this approach enables the Group to grow with 
purpose by continuously improving outcomes for our 
customers. We conduct regular monitoring to assess 
whether or not we meet our high customer service standards 
and colleagues’ remuneration is linked to outcomes. 
Upholding competition law 
We believe that consumers benefit from healthy 
competition between providers of financial services, 
and we compete vigorously and fairly, striving to offer 
excellent service and competitive products which meet 
our customers’ needs and provide good outcomes.

Our Group strategy
Overview
The Group recognises Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) as a powerful tool  
for unlocking value and operational 
efficiency for our customers and 
colleagues, whilst remaining ethical 
and sustainable in our practices.  
In January 2024, the Group upgraded the Data and AI 
Ethics (DAIE) Council to the status of ‘Committee’ – 
marking a significant milestone in the ethical 
deployment of AI technology for the Group. Over the 
past year we have used AI-powered solutions to support 
us in a range of areas including:
•	
Understanding customer complaints and behaviour
•	
Exploring insights from unstructured data sets
•	
Improving the quality of our learning and development 
offerings
•	
Strengthening our economic crime prevention controls
Through AI tools we can begin to assess the sustainability 
and ethical impacts of our products, giving us new tools 
to continue to grow, focus and change as an organisation. 
We continue to emphasise ethical use of AI in customer 
servicing – continuously prioritising transparency, fairness 
and data privacy.
Preventing complaints
In 2024, the Group demonstrated its commitment  
to enhancing customer experience through a robust 
framework designed to address and mitigate the root 
causes of complaints. Over the year, we implemented 
90 new improvement initiatives, positively impacting 
14,166 customers.
Improving the customer experience
By leveraging AI for personalised financial services, the  
Bank aims to improve customer access and engagement 
across the board – including empowering customers in 
underserved communities. Using Large Language Models 
(LLMs), a type of AI that uses deep learning techniques  
to learn and understand large data sets, we have:
•	 Produced a customer feedback tool that allows 
customers to provide feedback on the usefulness 
of the support they receive from us, so we can 
continue to improve our support mechanisms
•	 Implemented a chat summariser tool that supports 
our colleagues to respond to customer queries quickly 
and accurately 
•	 Invested in Aveni.ai to support in the development  
of secure AI tools that are focused on improving the 
quality of service and detecting customer vulnerabilities 
during calls
Managing the sustainability impacts of AI use
The Group recognises the potential of AI-powered banking 
to create both inclusive and disruptive sustainability 
impacts. In 2024, the Group proactively invested in internal 
upskilling of colleagues and senior leaders on generative 
AI technology and its ethical implications, covering risks 
outlined in the Group AI Assurance Framework and 
ensuring the consideration of AI impacts are embedded 
into our operations. 
We continue to develop our capability to identify AI 
model impacts such as environmental impacts on our 
broader net zero targets and performing the TNFD LEAP 
assessment of our data centres through diagnostic tools 
and methodologies. The Group’s AI Ethics team aims to 
align our AI initiatives and sustainability ambitions, 
supporting both technological advancement and 
environmental responsibility. The Bank also integrates 
sustainability into its digital transformation strategy 
by monitoring the efficiency of upstream data centres 
and use of renewable energy sources in those locations.
These improvements have enabled us to manage 
increased business growth and demand. Despite an 
uptick in fraud claims due to increased fraudster activity, 
the rise in complaints was proportionally lower than the 
increase in fraud incidents, supported by external 
factors such as Payments Services Regulations and 
heightened activity from claims management companies 
targeting lending.
 
The Group’s complaints per thousand for savings and 
personal current accounts has improved year-on-year 
due to associated journey improvement actions 
informed by strong root cause analysis. The business 
continues to focus on improvements that will enhance 
service accuracy and speed whilst advancing digitisation.
 
Responding to complaints
As a minimum standard we aim to meet the FCA’s  
Dispute Resolution (DISP) rules and respond to non-
payment complaints in eight weeks and payment 
complaints in 15 days. 
 
In 2024, the Group complaint operating model changed 
allowing our IP&I, Business and Commercial Banking and 
Consumer business units to have ownership for the 
end-to-end customer journey. 
 
We continue to have a collaborative approach to 
continue our focus on improving the complaint journey 
for our customers by investing in our people, improving 
our current technology and investing in new technologies. 
We launched a strategic letter writing tool to make it 
easier for our colleagues to write clear letters, faster.  
Our consumer complaints transformation team is proud 
to have won the UK IT Industry Artificial Intelligence 
Project of Year.

Overview
Our suppliers
Responsible and sustainable sourcing
We are committed to working collaboratively with our 
suppliers on developing our approach to responsible and 
sustainable sourcing; this is integral to the way we do 
business. Colleagues engaged in sourcing follow a defined 
business sourcing process as required by our internal 
sourcing and supply chain management policy and related 
procedures. The business sourcing process is a five-step 
process that facilitates the identification, assessment and 
mitigation of applicable risks as we select and contract 
with suppliers. We have a defined supply chain 
management framework including associated tools and 
learning for supplier accountable persons and supplier 
managers, which enables the ongoing risk-based 
management of the supplier relationship in line with 
the Group’s risk appetite. 
The risks associated with any arrangements with internal 
and external suppliers must be managed in compliance 
with the Group’s risk policy framework. Where external 
supplier relationships exist that fall outside the scope of our 
business sourcing and supplier management frameworks, 
business units and Group functions remain accountable for 
ensuring these engagements comply with all relevant Group 
policies, including the Code of Supplier Responsibility. 
The Group is a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code and 
in 2024 several of our legal entities (including Lloyds Bank 
General Insurance Limited, Bank of Scotland PLC, MBNA 
Limited, Lex Autolease Limited, and Black Horse Limited) 
received the Good Business Pays Fast Payer Award which 
recognises serial fast payers. This places us in the top 5 per 
cent of UK large corporate legal entities achieving the Good 
Business Pays threshold of paying suppliers in less than 30 
days and paying over 95 per cent of invoices on time over 
a 12-month rolling period.
Code of Supplier Responsibility
Our Code of Supplier Responsibility (the Code) sets out the 
key social, ethical and environmental values and behaviours 
that we want our suppliers to abide by. To continue to be 
purpose-driven, it is crucial that we operate in an ethical, 
sustainable, inclusive and accessible manner, including 
the way in which we source goods and services from 
our suppliers.
 
We expect suppliers to meet or exceed the provisions of 
our Code, which we share through the supplier contract 
in our business sourcing process. The Code is reviewed 
at least annually and updated to ensure its ongoing 
appropriateness, relevance and applicability for our 
suppliers. For further information on the Code refer 
to the full policy here 
Supplier due diligence
In assessing and managing risk, it is important that we have 
the right framework to operate responsibly and safely. 
Before selecting any supplier, we follow a due diligence 
process which evaluates them against key criteria across 
applicable risk domains.
Managed suppliers and FSQS
Lloyds Banking Group subscribes to the Financial Services 
Qualification System (FSQS), a third-party managed 
supplier qualification system for the financial sector that 
is currently used by c.70 financial institutions. This ensures 
we adopt a standardised approach to compliance and 
assurance, an integral part of our supply chain 
management activity for new and existing suppliers.
 
When completing FSQS we require our suppliers to 
confirm they have read, understood and complied with 
the Code and provide us with evidence to demonstrate 
their approach in the design, deployment and control 
of their policies and procedures.
Supplier assurance
The Group sourcing supplier assurance team conducts 
an annual programme of supplier reviews. These reviews 
target suppliers providing the goods and services with 
highest risk exposure to the Group, including for resilience, 
cyber, data privacy and customer risk. 
ESG risk assessment
We are using EcoVadis’ predictive sustainability analysis to 
help further understand our ESG risks across our core 
supplier base. This covers the key themes of environment, 
labour and human rights, ethics and sustainable 
procurement. We also ask our key suppliers to undertake 
an EcoVadis assessment as part of the Emerald Standard 
requirements on page 75.
Supporting supplier diversity
Our supplier diversity activity is geared towards ensuring 
that our supply chain aligns to our goal to represent the 
society we serve. The intent is to provide insights into the 
diversity of our existing supplier base and proactively 
ensure equal opportunity is provided to diverse suppliers.
Our efforts to achieve this to date have involved the 
establishment of partnerships with key supplier diversity 
advocacy organisations, proactive identification of 
diverse-owned businesses with a view to introducing 
them into our supply chain, and the creation of a 
database which allows us to better monitor and track 
our spend with diverse-owned businesses.
In 2024, we focused our efforts on the engagement 
of relevant sourcing teams and business stakeholders 
with the aim of identifying opportunities, for example, 
in recruitment, IT services and facilities management. 
We recognise that we’re early on our supplier diversity 
journey and will continue to monitor these opportunities.
For further information on the Group’s approach with 
suppliers refer to page 73.

Our Group strategy
Overview
Economic crime prevention
Every day, economic crime threatens our customers and 
society. Economic crime is not victimless, often resulting in 
irreversible impacts transcending financial loss for victims, 
their families and communities. 
We recognise the important role the Group plays in the 
detection and prevention of economic crime to protect  
our customers, communities and the integrity of the UK 
economy. We are committed to preventing the products 
and services we provide from being used to facilitate and 
commit crime, and we continue to invest and enhance  
our approach to keep pace with this evolving threat. 
In 2024, economic crime has been elevated to a principal 
risk in the Group’s risk taxonomy to reflect its significance 
and importance to the Group. We conduct our activities 
with integrity, respecting our regulatory, ethical and social 
responsibilities to protect our customers. By adopting  
a risk-based approach we focus on those customers, 
products, channels and jurisdictions that carry a higher  
risk of economic crime. For further information refer to  
the risk management section on page 181 in the annual 
report and accounts 2024 
Policy & Control Framework
The Group’s approach to managing economic crime risk is 
founded upon a holistic Economic Crime Prevention (ECP) 
policy, which aims to ensure that risks are identified, 
monitored and mitigated on an active and ongoing basis. 
Our ECP policy sets mandatory requirements to which the 
entire Group must comply across the following key risk areas: 
•	 Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC)
•	 Anti-Money Laundering (including Facilitation  
of tax evasion and Counter Terrorist Financing)
•	 Fraud
•	 Sanctions
Our mandatory requirements go beyond the minimum  
legal requirements and support best practice. 
The Group’s compliance with the ECP policy is continuously 
monitored from multiple perspectives, including oversight 
and assurance; the provision of management information; 
audit; and oversight by senior governance committees.
We apply a range of automated tools and machine-aided 
techniques to monitor payments and transactions, and 
where necessary we will stop payments, close accounts  
and terminate relationships where activity is suspicious or 
cannot be appropriately explained. Potential relationships 
will be declined, and existing relationships terminated 
(where lawful to do so), where the level of economic crime 
risk is outside of our risk appetite.
Anti-bribery and corruption
As a Group, we will not tolerate acts of bribery or corruption 
committed by any of our employees, including the Board  
of Directors, and any third parties who act on our behalf. 
Our ECP policy ensures that we comply with all relevant 
anti-bribery laws in the UK and abroad, including the UK 
Bribery Act 2010 and US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 
The Group’s ECP policy requires that all colleagues  
act with integrity and fairness, including completing 
appropriate due diligence when pursuing or awarding 
business. This specifically prohibits the offering, giving, 
promising or receiving of money or other inducements,  
or any other inappropriate practice which might be 
perceived to improperly influence a person’s conduct  
in their professional or public duty.
In the most recent Transparency International (TI) 
Corporate Anti-Corruption Benchmark in November, the 
Group maintained an ‘A’ rating. This benchmark measures 
and compares the performance of corporate (Anti-Bribery 
& Corruption) programmes in the UK using TI’s extensive 
anti-corruption expertise with input from experienced 
specialist practitioners. 
Training and awareness
Our approach to training supports a culture of economic 
crime detection and prevention among all our colleagues, 
with deeper expertise in all specialist roles. We undertake 
annual colleague training, as well as colleague awareness 
activities so everyone can understand the role that they 
play in tackling economic crime. We also undertake 
customer awareness to help them protect themselves  
from financial crime.
The Group’s comprehensive economic crime prevention 
training programme is delivered and monitored via our 
Group-wide learning management system. Training provides 
colleagues with the knowledge they need to protect our 
customers, the Group, the economy and themselves from 
the harm caused by criminals and terrorists. It is mandatory 
for all colleagues to undertake economic crime prevention 
training.
Working with partners and law 
enforcement 
We understand we cannot tackle economic crime alone. 
The Group is an active participant in public and private 
sector initiatives to develop best practice and share 
intelligence for more effective detection and prevention  
of economic crime. We work with a wide range of 
partners to tackle economic crime, including UK 
Finance, fraud prevention services such as Cifas, law 
enforcement including the National Crime Agency and 
City of London Police (CoLP), as well as our regulators, 
the Treasury, Home Office and other government 
departments. 
City of London Police 
The Group has continued our six-year partnership with  
the CoLP to reduce economic crime, disrupt criminals, 
and protect our customers, businesses and communities 
across the UK. The strategic partnership with the CoLP is 
based on a plan of activity across intelligence sharing, 
knowledge enhancement and economic crime 
prevention training. Our funding has enabled the 
expansion of the CoLP’s intelligence development 
capability, which is helping support tangible 
coordination across national, regional and local policing 
to address high harm fraud. 
Our strong partnership with the CoLP enables us to 
work together on fraud prevention initiatives, including 
the ‘Crooks on Campus’ campaign with We Fight Fraud, 
a financial crime prevention group. Crooks on Campus is 
a crime documentary/drama based upon real-life stories 
of money laundering, fraud and financial crime.  
It’s targeted directly at the student audience to inform, 
educate, and prevent young people becoming money  
mules and engaged in criminal activity.
Protecting our customers, 
communities and the integrity 
of the UK economy from the 
devastating impacts of economic 
crime is a top priority at Lloyds 
Banking Group. We are committed 
to remain an industry leader in 
efforts to make the UK a hostile 
place for economic crime.
How we deliver continued
In 2024, 98 per cent of colleagues across 
the Bank completed their annual 
refresher economic crime prevention 
training, compared to 99 per cent in 
2023. Controls are in place to manage 
those colleagues who do not complete 
their training on time.

capabilities using a threat-led approach, focused on 
enhancing our preventative, detective and responsive 
controls. 
For our customers this means:
•	 Being able to access their money and financial  
products safely in our apps and websites, protected  
by our built-in security
•	 Support and education to keep them safe from 
cyber security and fraud threats whilst promoting 
the importance of secure behaviours through learning 
campaigns and regular communication
•	 Keeping their personal data safe within our robust 
security control environment
Compliance and controls
The Group has achieved Cyber Essentials+ certification and 
encourages our suppliers and other third parties to also 
gain this government-supported certification. The Group 
utilises a range of best practice guidance as inputs to our 
Security Policy Frameworks including the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST) cyber security 
framework, ISO 27000 and PCI DSS. The Group seeks and 
attains appropriate information security insurance, which 
is reviewed on an annual basis.
In addition, we undertake horizon scanning to proactively 
identify updates to the framework and opportunities 
to respond to regulation, alongside our annual policy 
refresh cycle. 
In 2024, the Group achieved external validation of our 
security controls for the period 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, 
through an assessment of their design and operational 
effectiveness in the form of a System and Organisation 
Controls (SOC2) report. This covered our client-facing 
businesses in Commercial Banking, Lex Autolease, Lloyds 
Bank Capital Markets (LBCM), Insurance, Pensions and 
Investments. 
Governance
Cyber security maintains a high level of focus up to  
Board level. Regular updates to the Board and Group  
Risk Committees are supported by a quarterly Board 
sub-risk forum focused on cyber security, IT resilience and 
operational resilience. Cyber and data security also form 
part of the Group’s wider operational resilience framework. 
Embedding a culture of resilience and security across 
colleagues and key third parties is a focus area for the 
Group. The Group maintains strong and practised incident 
management frameworks. We continue exercising our 
incident management frameworks and teams upwards 
to Board level, with a focus on cyber security scenarios 
and threats.
Colleague training 
Group colleagues and contractors must complete an 
annual mandatory four-part security training programme, 
highlighting the key threats and risks that colleagues face 
and advising on how to mitigate them. There are also 
a variety of training resources available such as:
Our training programme received a nomination for 
Outstanding Cyber Security Training/Awareness Initiative  
at the 2024 Cyber OSPA Awards. The team works with 
academic partners to continue to foster an attitude 
committing to acting securely rather than unthinking 
compliance. We are proud to have highly skilled cyber 
security colleagues committed to maintaining and 
improving our cyber capabilities.
Cyber benchmarking
The Group undertakes a regular cyber benchmarking 
exercise, in conjunction with an independent consultancy, 
to understand and improve our cyber capabilities. This 
exercise continues to give us feedback on how our 
strategic focus areas compare against peers and ensure 
we continue to challenge ourselves to develop.
Collaboration
The Group recognises that cyber security is a material 
issue impacting our entire sector and we collaborate 
externally, working in conjunction with both our peers 
and the government on initiatives such as:
•	 The Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre
•	 The UK government’s National Cyber Security Centre
•	 The Cross-Market Operational Resilience Group
•	 The Cyber Defence Alliance (CDA)
Data privacy
The Group takes the responsibility of managing our 
customers’ and colleagues’ data seriously and values the 
trust placed upon us to ensure each individual’s personal 
data is managed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent 
manner. We understand how personal data enables the 
delivery of good outcomes and how important our 
safeguards are for preventing customers and colleagues 
from foreseeable harm. The Group demonstrates 
accountability to data subjects and regulatory 
expectations through policy, process and controls, which 
we continually evolve to ensure individuals’ personal 
data rights are respected in all the moments that matter, 
which includes ensuring:
•	 Personal data is limited to what is necessary, 
processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner
•	 Personal data is collected for an explicit, legitimate, 
adequate, and necessary purpose and not further 
processed in a non-compatible manner
•	 The risk posed to our data subjects is assessed, 
monitored, and escalated when necessary
•	 Data subjects’ rights are upheld and respected
•	 Personal data is processed with appropriate 
protection against unauthorised or unlawful 
processing, and against accidental loss, or damage

Whistleblowing
Speak Up and whistleblowing
Speak Up is the Group’s whistleblowing framework, 
providing a confidential or anonymous channel for 
colleagues, suppliers, contractors and third parties to 
report concerns they feel unable to report through their 
manager. Reports can be made in several ways, including 
online or via phone through an independent third party, 
available 24/7, in a range of languages.
All concerns are taken seriously and treated sensitively. 
Where investigations are required, these are carried out 
by highly trained and empathetic investigators. Anyone 
reporting a concern or involved in an investigation is 
supported throughout the process and we are committed 
to preventing and addressing any form of retaliation 
resulting from someone raising a Speak Up concern.
Commitment to a Speak Up culture
The Group Speak Up policy sets out our commitment to 
sustaining a culture where colleagues feel comfortable to 
Speak Up and raise their concerns. Colleagues complete 
mandatory annual training, which includes a separate 
module for line managers. The Speak Up framework is 
managed by Group Conduct Investigations, a team 
specialising in whistleblowing and complex investigations. 
Group Conduct Investigations promotes colleague 
confidence and awareness of Speak Up through ongoing 
communication and awareness activity. Colleagues also 
have access to a dedicated site providing guidance on 
the process and details of wellbeing support available. 
The Group invests heavily in the skills of its investigators, 
including maintaining a robust Training & Competency 
Framework and professional qualifications. 
Each business and function within the Group has appointed 
a Speak Up Officer. Speak Up Officers work with Group 
Conduct Investigations to promote a Speak Up culture 
and to drive actions based on Speak Up insights. Group 
Conduct Investigations represents the Group at a range 
of industry events and forums, discussing best practices 
and advancing whistleblowing culture in the industry.
Speak Up governance
Sarah Legg, non-executive director and Chair of the Audit 
Committee, serves as the Group Whistleblowing Champion, 
overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness 
of the Group’s Speak Up arrangements. She presents an 
annual whistleblowing report to the Group Board. 
The Group Audit Committee also receives regular updates 
on the Speak Up framework, including case volumes, 
emerging trends, investigation outcomes and actions taken. 
Partnership with Protect
We are proud to be a long-standing member of Protect, 
the UK whistleblowing charity. We signpost Protect’s free 
advice-line to our colleagues, suppliers, contractors and 
third parties. The Group collaborates with Protect to 
benchmark and develop Speak Up initiatives and share 
ideas with other members.
As a Protect Member, the Group undertakes Protect’s 
independent benchmark audit. Group Conduct 
Investigations submitted the Group’s top whistleblowing 
initiatives from 2024 for Protect’s independent review.
“Having audited Lloyd Banking Group’s arrangements 
several times, it is our view that the Group’s Speak Up 
arrangements are well developed and among the best 
that we review in detail. A key strength is an agile team 
that proactively seeks opportunities to improve.” 
Elizabeth Gardiner
Chief Executive, Protect
Group Conduct Investigations continues to work with 
Protect on areas of focus for Lloyds Banking Group, 
demonstrating our commitment to sustaining and 
enhancing a Speak Up culture.
In October 2024, an amendment to the Equality Act 
2010 established a legal duty for employers to take 
proactive measures to prevent sexual harassment 
in the workplace. The Group has created a new policy 
to address the legislation and restate our commitment 
to a safe, inclusive, and supportive work environment 
that is free from sexual harassment. Mandatory training on 
Sexual Harassment Prevention has now been introduced 
to all colleagues outlining the importance of this legislation, 
our values and expected behaviours alongside available 
reporting and support channels. 
In 2025, we will be creating a more in-depth mandatory 
training module regarding sexual harassment for all 
colleagues.
We are committed to sustaining 
a culture where people feel safe, 
supported, and empowered to 
Speak Up if something doesn’t 
feel right.

Regulatory 
developments
Our approach  
to tax
Tax is one of the ways in which 
businesses contribute to the 
societies in which they operate, 
and we have been among the UK’s 
highest payers of corporate taxes  
for several years.
In 2024, we paid £2.1 billion of cash taxes primarily on 
business profits, VAT on goods and services needed to 
run our business, bank levy and employer social security 
on staff wages and salaries. In addition, we collected 
£1.9 billion of cash taxes primarily from payroll and 
customer product taxes. 
Appropriate, prudent and transparent tax behaviour 
is a key component of being a responsible business. 
We comply with the HMRC Code of Practice on Taxation 
for Banks.
We do not interpret tax laws in a way that we believe is 
contrary to the intention of Parliament, and we do not 
promote tax avoidance products to our customers.
Further information on the Group’s approach to tax 
can be found in our tax strategy and approach to tax 
report 2024 
The Group continues to monitor  
the evolving sustainability reporting 
landscape. This section details 
activities undertaken to date to 
prepare for upcoming regulatory 
reporting changes. 
International Sustainability  
Standards Board (ISSB)
The Group has been following the UK Sustainability 
Disclosure Technical Advisory Committee assessments and 
recommendations during the year in respect of the two 
sustainability reporting standards currently released by the 
ISSB: General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-
related Financial Information (S1) and Climate-related 
Disclosures (S2). UK-endorsed ISSB standards are expected 
to be released in the first half of 2025. 
We are preparing to report in accordance with these 
standards following the UK government’s positive 
endorsement decision and the update to the FCA’s 
requirements for UK-listed companies.
Corporate Sustainability Reporting  
Directive (CSRD)
The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD) mandates reporting in accordance with the 
European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) 
and the EU Taxonomy. The 12 EU Sustainability Reporting 
Standards have a multi-stakeholder focus, covering the full 
range of environmental, social and governance topics, using 
double materiality instead of financial materiality.
The Group is expecting to report on a legal entity basis 
from 2025 in respect of our in-scope entities within 
Germany and Luxembourg. Group level reporting as 
a non-EU parent company is planned for 2028.
Corporate Sustainability Due  
Diligence Directive (CSDDD)
The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive 
(CSDDD) interacts with the CSRD requiring large 
companies to carry out due diligence to identify and 
address the adverse human rights and environmental 
impacts of their operations, subsidiaries, and value chains. 
While the Group is currently not directly in scope for the 
CSDDD, we continue to monitor the adoption and revision 
of the CSDDD within the EU to assess any implication this 
may have on the Group and its subsidiaries.
California Assembly Bill (AB 1305)
The Group is assessed to be in scope of California Assembly 
Bill (AB) 1305 which requires disclosure on net zero, carbon 
neutrality and emission reduction claims, as well as 
voluntary carbon offsets purchased, used, marketed or sold 
in California. Our mapping against these requirements can 
be found in our sustainability reporting framework index 
2024 
 noting we are not engaged in any offset activity in 
California that would require disclosure.
Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (TNFD)
The Group continues to monitor TNFD developments 
within the UK and Europe. Nature is being integrated 
into our overall environmental sustainability approach 
aligned to the four pillars of: Strategy, Governance, 
Risk Management and Metrics & Targets. The Group 
continues to signal progress towards TNFD recommended 
disclosures, highlighting our commitment to 
demonstrate nature progress where appropriate.
Sustainability disclosure requirements 
and investment labels
During 2024, Scottish Widows reviewed the FCA’s 
ESG 4 and 5 provisions on labelling and marketing 
as they apply to our business. We have specifically 
reviewed our existing processes and controls on the 
anti-greenwashing rule introduced on 31 May 2024 and 
have introduced new processes and controls. We have 
prepared new consumer-facing disclosures to comply 
with the ESG naming and marketing rules for the one 
retail fund meeting the relevant criteria. While the 
fund’s approach invests in line with sustainability 
themes, it does not currently have a sustainable 
investment objective, as specified by the FCA. 
Therefore, we have not applied to the FCA for 
a sustainability investment label. We will continue 
to monitor requirements as the FCA’s rules evolve 
to include other parts of our business.

Overview
Human rights 
and modern 
slavery
The UN Guiding Principles Reporting 
Framework asks companies to focus 
their human rights reporting on  
their salient human rights issues.  
A company’s salient human rights 
issues stand out because they are at 
risk of the most significant negative 
impact through the company’s 
activities or business relationships.
We have identified and prioritised the inherent salient 
human rights risks that can be connected across the 
Group’s operations and value chain, this includes modern 
slavery as a potential material human rights risk due to 
some of the sectors and activities which the Group funds 
or is involved with. 
Our identified potential salient human  
rights risks across our value chain
Having identified the inherent salient human rights risks, we 
are developing a human rights framework to manage these 
risks embedding respect for human rights into the Group’s 
core business where it is relevant. We are reviewing our 
current business processes, some of which already consider 
human rights risks, identifying gaps and developing robust 
measures to prevent, detect or mitigate these potential 
risks. In addition, we have developed our Human Rights 
Position Statement which outlines the Group’s approach  
to managing human rights. 
Alongside the salient human rights risks which have been 
identified, activity within the Group in relation to the 
protection of human rights is focused on: 
•	 Inclusion and diversity
•	 Mental health and colleague wellbeing in the workplace 
•	 Supporting customers most in need 
•	 Tackling modern slavery through our supply chain
•	 Protecting customer privacy
•	 Data security to keep our customers’ money and data safe

Training our colleagues
To support the work the Group does to mitigate the risk 
of modern slavery across our business and supply chain, 
we launched Group-wide modern slavery training in 2024, 
available to all colleagues. The aim of this training is to 
raise awareness of this issue and support colleague 
understanding of how modern slavery impacts the Group 
and the role colleagues can play to mitigate the risk as 
well as to support survivors of modern slavery. 
We launched a new mandatory training for Economic Crime 
Prevention in 2024. This included a module focused on the 
laundering of funds from modern slavery and supports 
colleagues in their understanding of modern slavery red flags. 
Colleagues can learn about the different ways an individual 
may be exploited by a trafficker through such as through 
control of their bank account and identity documents, for 
example. The training module was developed with subject 
matter expertise input from across the Group. By supporting 
our colleagues to recognise the signs of modern slavery in 
the workplace or across the supply chain, we can identify 
potential cases so that the appropriate steps can be taken 
to prevent exploitation and abuse taking place. 
Human rights issues and how  
we are addressing them

Fair remuneration
Lloyds Banking Group became a UK Living Wage Employer 
in 2015 and we review our pay rates annually to ensure 
minimum rates are above the statutory minimum and living 
wage requirements that are applicable in the countries we 
operate in. We have worked, and continue to work, with 
third-party contractors to ensure that they operate in line 
with our commitments and expect them to ensure that 
the wages they pay meet legally mandated minimum 
requirements without unauthorised deductions.
Non-discrimination, inclusivity and equality/harsh 
or degrading treatment/harassment
The Group has an extensive diversity, equity and inclusion 
programme and is committed to meeting its statutory

training.
How we deliver continued
Human rights and modern slavery continued
In 2024 we worked with a specialist consultant, 
Sancroft, to better understand the human rights 
risks across our investment portfolio. We used the 
corporate assessment recommendations made by 
the Taskforce on Social Factors as a foundation for our 
work. This built on our own analysis, widening the scope 
of companies, and providing a broader view from a 
portfolio level. Sancroft analysed 69 industries, 
representing the majority of the portfolio, to inform 
a strategic approach to managing these risks and 
meeting our responsibility to respect human rights.
The analysis was a starting point to understand what 
sectors and risks appear in our portfolio as well as 
understanding current standards and gaps in data. 
As the analysis was based on a salient human rights 
risks assessment, it is not immediately transferable 
to investment integration due to the complicated 
nature of the risks and varying materiality. We will 
use the findings to review and refine our stewardship 
approach and inform our engagement with investment 
managers and influence fund development. The aim 
is for this analysis to feed into our investment 
strategies as data availability, consistency and 
standardisation evolve.

and/or commitments; statements of plans, objectives or goals 
of the Group or its management and other statements that are 
not historical fact and statements of assumptions underlying such 
statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve 
risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon 
circumstances that will or may occur in the future. There are inherent 
risks and uncertainties associated with achieving future emissions 
targets and implementing net-zero transition strategies and plans 
in a complex, interdependent, and continually evolving global 
landscape. The Group therefore reserves the right to adjust, 
amend, or adapt its metrics and targets in response to unforeseen 
circumstances or changes in external factors and dependencies 
which impact the feasibility of achieving the stated targets. 
Factors that could cause actual business, strategy, targets, plans  
and/or results (including but not limited to the payment of dividends) 
to differ materially from forward-looking statements include, but 
are not limited to: general economic and business conditions in 
the UK and internationally (including in relation to tariffs); acts 
of hostility or terrorism and responses to those acts, or other such 
events; geopolitical unpredictability; the war between Russia and 
Ukraine; the conflicts in the Middle East; the tensions between 
China and Taiwan; political instability including as a result of any 
UK general election; market related risks, trends and developments; 
changes in client and consumer behaviour and demand; exposure to 
counterparty risk; the ability to access sufficient sources of capital, 
liquidity and funding when required; changes to the Group’s credit 
ratings; fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, stock 
markets and currencies; volatility in credit markets; volatility in the 
price of the Group’s securities; natural pandemic and other disasters; 
risks concerning borrower and counterparty credit quality; risks
