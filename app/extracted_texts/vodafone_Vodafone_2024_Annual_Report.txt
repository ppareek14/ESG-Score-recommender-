Welcome to our 2024 Annual Report 
We continue to use a simplified digital-first approach to our reporting, reflecting how we operate 
as a business. We provide summaries at the start of each key section, denoted by an S . 
New shape of the Group 
Following the announced sale of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy as part of right-sizing our 
portfolio for growth, both businesses are now treated as discontinued operations, and therefore 
excluded from Group results for continuing operations. Prior periods have also been re-stated 
to reflect the new shape of the Group.
Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) reporting
This year we have incorporated both our full cyber security and climate-related risk reporting 
into the Annual Report. We also report against a number of voluntary reporting frameworks to 
help our stakeholders understand our sustainable business performance. Disclosures prepared 
in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) and Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (‘SASB’) guidance can be found in our ESG Addendum and on our website. 
Our website also includes a wide range of reports which can be found on the links below.

Operating in a rapidly changing industry 
Our governance
Our business is underpinned by our strong 
governance and risk management framework.
Governance
The Board held seven scheduled meetings this year to discuss key strategic 
matters, our purpose and culture, our people and stakeholder interests.
The Nominations and Governance Committee evaluates the 
composition and performance of the Board and ensures an appropriate 
balance of independence, skills, knowledge, experience and diversity.
The Audit and Risk Committee provides effective governance over 
the appropriateness of financial reporting of the Group, including the 
adequacy of related disclosures, the performance of the internal audit 
function and the external auditor and oversight of the Group’s systems 
of internal control, risk management framework and compliance activities.
The Technology Committee supports the Board with fulfilling the 
technology strategy for the Group, including assessing risks and 
exploring new innovations for future growth.
The ESG Committee oversees our Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’) programme, including our purpose, sustainability 
and responsible business practices, and our contribution to the societies 
we operate in under our social contract.
The Remuneration Committee advises the Board on policies for 
executive remuneration and reward packages for the Chair, executives 
and senior management team.

Risk management
Risks are not static and as the environment changes, so do risks – 
some diminish or increase, while new risks appear. We continuously 
review and improve our risk processes in order to ensure that the 
Company has the appropriate level of support in meeting its strategic 
objectives.
Our risk framework clearly defines roles and responsibilities, and 
sets out a consistent end-to-end process for identifying and 
managing risks. We have embedded the risk framework across the 
Group as this allows us to take a holistic approach and to make 
meaningful comparisons. Our approach is continuously enhanced, 
enabling more dynamic risk detection, modelling of risk 
interconnectedness and use of data, all of which are improving our 
risk visibility and our responses.
Our Board oversees principal and emerging risks, which are 
reported to the various management committees and the Board 
throughout the year. Additionally, risk owners are invited to present 
in-depth reviews to ensure that risks are continuously monitored, and 
appropriate treatment plans are implemented to bring each risk 
within an acceptable tolerance level.

Connected devices
 – A wide range of new devices, across all sectors 
and applications, are increasingly being 
connected to the internet.
 – The Internet of Things (‘IoT’) is expected to 
create huge value for businesses and society, 
unlocking new efficiencies by delivering 
real-time information.
 – As the number of IoT devices increases, 
physical assets are also communicating with 
each other in real-time and new digital markets 
are being established giving birth to the 
‘Economy of Things’.

Digital payments
 – Businesses demand reliable and secure mobile 
connectivity as transactions migrate to online 
channels and apps.

drives the adoption of digital payments.
 – Network operators and a range of FinTech 
startups are using mobile payment 
applications to sell additional financial services

Adoption of cloud technology
 – The cloud is increasingly utilised by businesses 
and consumers as a more efficient way of 
sharing compute capacity and services.
 – SMEs increasingly understand the benefits of 
cloud technology but lack the technical 
expertise or direct relationships with cloud 
specialists to make an effective transition to 
the cloud.
 – This presents an opportunity for network 
operators to play a role as a partner to support 
smaller businesses on their digital 
transformation journeys.

long-term impacts of Gen AI are only starting 
to be understood.
 – The technology is widely expected to drive 
significant economic benefit globally through 
productivity increases and new business 
opportunities.

Notes:
1. Information relating to 2023 and 2022 has been restated to reflect portfolio changes 
completed during FY23 and FY24.
2. Operations in Italy and Spain have been classified as discontinued operations in line with ‘IFRS 
5 - Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. All remaining operations 
are reported as continuing operations. This disaggregation of information has been reflected 
in all comparative periods.
3. Based on coverage in Africa, including Egypt.
4. Includes 100% of data relating to Vodafone Ziggo.
5. Includes Vodafone Italy and Vodafone Spain.
6. Includes 100% of data relating to Safaricom.
7. The avoided emissions for 2022 have been restated to 13.5 million tonnes CO2e (previously 
15.6 million tonnes CO2e) resulting from the incorrect calculation of emissions avoided in 
fleet management solutions.

Reshaping Vodafone for growth
Chair’s message 
This has been a year of significant change as we aim 
to deliver our purpose to connect for a better future. 
We have taken all the steps needed to transform our 
portfolio and good progress has been made with our 
strategic priorities of Customers, Simplicity and Growth.
Portfolio transformed, good initial strategic progress
As I said last year, the Company has underperformed and further 
change is needed to drive sustainable value creation for our 
shareholders. The Board and I have been pleased with Margherita’s 
pace and decisiveness over the last year and we have seen the first 
impacts of our focus on our new strategic priorities of Customers, 
Simplicity and Growth. Whilst there is much more to do, we are 
making faster and more decisive commercial decisions, customer 
satisfaction has seen broad-based improvements, and we have moved 
towards a commercial model for our shared operations. Vodafone 
Business growth is accelerating as we are strengthening our position 
as the leading platform for businesses, supported by unique strategic 
partnerships. We are also forging partnerships that leverage our 
existing strengths, unlock value and accelerate growth. 
The shape of the Group has also changed as we focus on markets 
where we can grow and earn returns on our investments in excess of 
our cost of capital; this was not possible organically in UK, Spain or 
Italy. With our reshaped footprint, Vodafone will have strong positions 
with good local scale in each of our markets, and this will ensure we 
can deliver sustainable and predictable growth and a step-up in returns.
Board composition
Following an extensive and rigorous search, I was delighted to 
welcome Luka Mucic as Chief Financial Officer and an Executive 
Director of the Board in September 2023. Luka brings substantial 
experience in finance, international leadership and enterprise & 
technology solutions. Luka has been very supportive of the 
transformation of Vodafone and I am confident that his track record 
and expertise will aid the delivery of our strategic priorities.
We have also welcomed Hatem Dowidar, Group Chief Executive Officer 
of e&, to our Board as a Non-Executive Director from 19 February 2024. 
Hatem represents our largest shareholder and brings extensive 
telecommunications experience. He also knows us well after holding 
various Vodafone leadership positions prior to joining e&. Hatem’s 
appointment to the Board marks the next phase of our strategic 
relationship with e&. 
Last year, the Board approved the creation of a Technology Committee as a 
Committee of the Board. I have been pleased to see the Committee and its 
expert membership bring additional insight to the Board and Vodafone, in 
its first year overseeing the Group’s technology strategy and considering 
how it supports the overall Company strategy today, and in the future.
FY24 financial performance & new capital allocation 
framework
Our financial results for FY24 were ahead of expectations and we 
achieved our financial guidance for the year. 
Total revenue declined 2.5% to €36.7 billion, with Group organic service 
revenue growing by 6.3%1 this year. This was driven by growth in 
Europe, Africa and Business.
Our reported financials were also impacted by adverse currency 
movements during the year.
Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 2.2%1 on an organic basis as good 
service revenue progress was partially offset by higher energy costs 
and inflationary impacts. Adjusted free cash flow was €2.6 billion1, 
reflecting lower adjusted EBITDAaL. Group return on capital employed 
increased as a result of the right-sizing of our portfolio, however 
decreased year-on-year to 7.5% on a pre-tax basis due to lower 
operating profit1. Group operating profit decreased by 74.6% to €3.7 
billion, primarily reflecting business disposals in the prior financial 
year and adverse foreign exchange rate movements, and as a result 
basic earnings per share decreased to 7.47 eurocents. Our balance 
sheet position remains robust, with Group leverage now at 2.5x2.The 
Board has declared a total dividend per share of 9.0 eurocents with 
respect to FY24, implying a final dividend per share of 4.5 eurocents, 
which will be paid on 2 August 2024 following shareholder approval 
at our AGM.
In March 2024, we announced a new capital allocation framework as 
the execution of our portfolio right-sizing has provided the necessary 
clarity over the future shape of the Group. Under our new capital 
allocation framework, we will continue our disciplined investment 
approach, supporting our network, strategy and growth levers; adopt 
a new lower target leverage range with built-in flexibility; re-base the 
FY25 dividend to 4.5 eurocents per share to reflect the reshaped 
Group, with an ambition to grow over time; and return surplus capital 
to shareholders through share buybacks. 
Connectivity drives competitiveness
As the economies and societies in Vodafone’s markets continue to 
evolve, our role in providing digital connectivity and solutions grows 
in importance, not only for our customers but for policymakers too. 
Our digital services help to improve lives, transform industrial 
productivity, drive growth and secure infrastructure. We remain firmly 
committed to supporting Europe’s and Africa’s digital ambitions for 
the benefit of their citizens and businesses. 
In Africa, connectivity that enables our customers to access the 
internet and make mobile money transfers is fundamental to the 
economic development of the six countries in which we operate. As 
more customers wish to move to more advanced technologies, 
Vodafone is working with international partners and multilateral 
institutions to tackle the challenge of smartphone affordability. 
In Europe, a ‘connectivity chasm’ is opening with regions like North 
America and Asia. There is a risk that in the future Europeans will have 
inferior access to the latest digital innovations simply because of 
outdated public policies. As a result, Europe will lack the advanced 
connectivity that is essential to its global competitiveness. 
Though European policymakers have made some progress, the 
telecommunications market in Europe remains highly fragmented 
and more needs to be done to create the right environment for 
investing in next-generation connectivity. With structurally low 
returns on capital in European markets and its wider importance to 
competitiveness, connectivity must be a priority for European 
politicians as they seek to reverse the continent’s declining 
productivity and share of global output. 
This is an important year for Europe. European Parliament elections 
and a new European Commission give political leaders the rare 
chance to change course and return the continent to its position as a 
global economic leader. They must take it. 
The year ahead
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our colleagues across 
the Group who have continued to work tirelessly to support our 
transformation as we focus on our customers, become a simpler 
business, and accelerate growth. 
As we enter FY25, I am confident that Margherita and her management team 
will continue to make progress on our strategic priorities. The ‘reshaped 
Vodafone’ will be a best-in-class telco in Europe & Africa and the leading 
platform for businesses, ultimately delivering value for all our stakeholders.

Chief Executive’s statement and strategic roadmap
Transformation gaining momentum
“A year ago, I set out my plans to transform Vodafone, including the 
need to right-size Europe for growth. Since then, we have announced 
a series of transactions and we are now delivering growth in all of our 
markets across Europe and Africa.
Much more still needs to be done in the year ahead. We will step-up 
investment in our customer experience, improve our underlying 
performance in Germany and accelerate our momentum in Business, 
whilst also continuing to simplify our operations throughout the 
group. We are fundamentally transforming Vodafone for growth.”
Margherita Della Valle 
Group Chief Executive
In May 2023, we set out a new roadmap to transform Vodafone along 
three strategic priorities: Customers, Simplicity, and Growth. We 
measure our operational progress in these areas through a consistent 
scorecard summarised below. During FY24, we have reshaped our 
European footprint to focus on growing markets, with strong positions 
and good local scale. Alongside the progress to right-size our 
portfolio for growth, we have made good early progress with our 
operational transformation, which aims to improve the experience 
provided to our customers, remove complexity from our operations 
and accelerate growth in revenue, profit, cash flow and return on 
capital.
Customers
 – Wide-reaching customer experience transformation underway, 
supported by additional investment of €140 million1 in FY24, as 
well as new incentives and talent development plans. 
 – Customers insights processed through real-time AI models, feeding 
into detailed action plans on a weekly basis in all markets.
 – Frontline tools and processes enhancements benefitting 70,000 
team members. 
 – Significant improvement in Germany fixed network reliability, 
recognised in four independent network quality tests.
 – Despite material price inflation, customer detractors have reduced 
across all segments, and we now have leading or co-leading net 
promotor scores in 5 out of 9 European markets1.
Simplicity
 – New organisational structure and executive management team in place.
 – Completed first phase of commercialising shared operations, 
enabling greater transparency, productivity and flexibility.
 – Actioned 5,0001 role reductions and announced a further 2,000 in 
first year of 3-year 11,0001 plan and continued to deliver opex 
efficiencies.
Growth
 – Reshaped European footprint focused on growing telecommunications 
markets, with strong positions and good local scale.
 – Vodafone now growing in all segments and accelerating 
throughout the year. 
 – Accelerated organic service revenue growth of Vodafone Business 
to 5.4% in Q4; B2B focus step-up with new organisation, sales 
transformation plan, investment in products and capabilities and 
strategic partnership with Microsoft.
More remains to be done across all these areas in FY25. Our priorities for the 
year ahead include: stepping-up our operational performance in Germany; 
further strengthening our capabilities in Vodafone Business; completing the 
commercialisation of our shared operations; and completing our in-flight 
portfolio transformation.

Mega trends
Long-term trends shaping our industry
Digital services and next-generation connectivity 
are increasingly central to everything we do – and 
will be the driving forces that redefine relationships 
between sectors, employers, employees, 
customers, and friends and family. 
There are four ‘mega trends’ that we believe will 
continue to shape our industry and the key areas of 
focus in our strategy for the years ahead: connected 
devices, digital payments, adoption of cloud 
technology, and generative artificial intelligence. 
Connected devices
The world is becoming ever more connected, and it is not just driven 
by smartphones. A wide range of new devices, across all sectors and 
applications, are increasingly being connected to the internet. The 
number of connections for these devices, known as the Internet of 
Things (‘IoT’), is expected to increase from 2.9 billion in 2022, to 7.3 
billion in 20321.
For consumers, there are a growing range of applications such as 
smartwatches, tracking devices for pets, bags and bicycles, and 
connected vehicles, which can lower insurance premiums and enable 
a range of advanced in-vehicle solutions. 
For businesses, the demand for IoT and potential use cases is even 
more evident. These include solutions such as automated monitoring 
of energy usage across national grids, tracking consumption in smart 
buildings and detecting traffic and congestion in cities.
In environments that are more localised, such as factories and ports, 
network operators are building and running Mobile Private Networks 
(‘MPNs’). MPNs offer corporate customers unparalleled security and 
bespoke network control. As an example, MPNs enable autonomous 
factories to connect to thousands of robots, enabling them to work in 
a synchronised way. Once a product leaves the factory it can also be 
tracked seamlessly through global supply chain management 
applications, whether it is delivered through the post, in a vehicle or 
even via drones.
In areas where the same solution can be deployed across multiple 
sectors, network operators are moving beyond connectivity to 
provide complex end-to-end hardware and software solutions such as 
surveillance, smart metering and remote monitoring. It is often more 
efficient for these solutions to be created in-house. Scaled operators 
can leverage their unique position to co-create or partner with nimble 
start-ups at attractive economics.
As the number of IoT devices increases, physical assets are also 
communicating with each other in real time and new digital markets 
are being established. This is leading to the Economy of Things, where 
connected devices securely trade with each other on a user’s behalf, 
without human intervention. This presents businesses across multiple 
industries with exciting opportunities to transform goods into tradeable 
digital assets which can compete in new disruptive online markets.
Digital payments 
Businesses in Europe continue to expand and migrate sales channels 
from physical premises to online channels such as websites and 
mobile applications. As a result, businesses increasingly transact 
through mobile-enabled payment services which remove the need 
for legacy fixed sales terminals. Consequently, businesses demand 
reliable and secure mobile connectivity. Consumers are also 
increasingly transitioning away from using cash to digital payment 
methods conducted directly via mobile phones or smartwatches, 
further increasing the importance of mobile networks. 
In Africa, digital payments are primarily conducted via mobile phones 
through payment networks owned and operated by network 
operators. The annual value of mobile money transactions reached 
€1.3 trillion globally in 2023, up 14% versus the previous year2. 
Consumers are also moving beyond peer-to-peer transactions as 
rising smartphone penetration drives the adoption of mobile payment 
applications. Network operators and a range of FinTech start-ups are 
using these applications to sell additional financial services focused 
products, ranging from advances on mobile airtime and device 
insurance to more complex offerings such as life insurance, loans and 
e-commerce marketplaces. These play a critical role in improving 
financial inclusion for millions of people across Africa in areas where 
the traditional banking sector has not been able to reach.
M-Pesa is Africa’s most successful mobile money service and the 
region’s largest Fintech platform. It provides more than 63 million 
customers across six countries in Africa with a safe, secure and 
affordable way to send and receive money, top up airtime, make bill 
payments, receive salaries and get short-term loans. 
Businesses are also increasingly reliant on operator-owned payment 
infrastructure for consumer-to-business payments and for large 
business-to-business transfers. These payment networks drive scale 
benefits for the largest operators by allowing customers to save on 
transaction fees whilst also driving both business and consumer 
customers to seek reliable and secure networks.
Vodacom’s super app VodaPay allows users to manage money 
through a digital wallet and make payments for all the products and 
services that the app offers through a wide range of partner 
businesses.

Generative artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (‘AI’) is the ability of machines to perform tasks 
that are typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning 
and problem-solving.
Generative AI (‘Gen AI’) is a type of AI that can create new content, 
such as images, text or music by learning from existing examples of 
the same content. It does this by training foundation models, known 
as Large Language Models (‘LLMs’), on huge sets of example data. At 
the end of the training, the model can generate content that is 
statistically similar to the examples used for its training. Growth in 
computing power and the abundance of data available for training 
has led to an exponential growth in the size and capability of artificial 
neural networks, with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022 
sparking a significant increase in interest in the technology among 
both consumers and enterprises. The latest Gen AI models are based 
on networks with trillions of parameters and have been trained on the 
entire contents of the internet.
Potential applications of Gen AI can range from those that directly 
benefit customers, such as AI-generated recommendations or 
hyper-personalised marketing content, to more operational use cases 
such as analysis of unstructured data or software development 
‘co-piloting’ (drafting computer code based on natural-language 
prompts). The full range of potential applications and long-term 
impacts of Gen AI are starting to be understood, but the technology is 
widely expected to drive significant economic benefit globally 
through productivity increases and new business opportunities.
Vodafone is strategically positioned to deploy Gen AI at industry-
leading speed and scale, leveraging our deep partnerships with 
Google and Microsoft and our best-in-class reference architecture 
and cloud-based data ocean. Initial use cases include enhancing 
customer satisfaction by delivering hyper-personalised experiences 
across all Vodafone customer touch points, including Vodafone’s 
digital assistant TOBi. Vodafone employees will also be able to 
leverage Gen AI capabilities to transform working practices, boost 
productivity and improve digital efficiency.
Adoption of cloud technology
Over the past decade, large technology companies have invested 
heavily in advanced centralised data storage and processing 
capabilities that organisations and consumers can access remotely 
through connectivity services (commonly termed ‘cloud’ technology). 
As a result, organisations and consumers are increasingly moving 
away from using their own expensive hardware and device-specific 
software to using more efficient shared hardware capacity or services 
through the cloud. This is popular as it allows upfront capital 
investment savings, the ability to efficiently scale resources to meet 
demand, systems that can be easily updated and increased resilience. 
This is driving demand for fast, reliable and secure connectivity with 
lower latency.
Many small businesses increasingly understand the benefits of cloud 
technology, however, they lack the technical expertise or direct 
relationships with large enterprise and cloud specialists. This presents 
an opportunity for network operators, particularly those with strong 
existing relationships to help customers navigate their move to the 
cloud at scale.
Larger corporates, which may already use the cloud today, are 
progressively moving away from complex systems based on their own 
servers or single cloud solutions, to multi-cloud offers sold by 
network operators and their partners. This approach reduces supplier 
risk and increases corporate agility and resilience. Large corporates 
continue to drive higher demand for robust, secure and efficient 
connectivity services as they transition from their own legacy 
hardware and services. Cloud providers also recognise the criticality of 
telecommunications networks. Many cloud providers are partnering 
with the largest network operators, sometimes through revenue 
sharing agreements, to develop edge computing solutions which 
integrate data centres at the edge of telecommunication networks to 
deliver customers reduced latency. The opportunity is significant, as 
the total addressable market in business-to-business cloud and 
security is expected to reach €86 billion by 2028 compared to €47 
billion today. 
Consumers use cloud solutions for a variety of reasons, including 
digital storage, online media consumption or interacting through the 
metaverse. Consumer hardware can also in some cases be replaced 
by cloud-first solutions. For example, new cloud-based gaming 
services allow consumers to stream complex, bandwidth-heavy 
computer games directly to their phones or tablets, without the need 
for expensive dedicated hardware. Fast and reliable connectivity will 
act as a catalyst for further innovation and consumer applications, 
many of which do not yet exist today.

Our people strategy is to create an inclusive 
environment for growth where everyone has the 
opportunity to thrive and belong. Our engaged and 
experienced teams are a key strength and will 
support us through the transformation of Vodafone.
The ‘Spirit of Vodafone’
Our culture – the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ – outlines the beliefs we stand 
for and the behaviours that enable our strategy and purpose.
We foster our culture by developing behaviours that reinforce our Spirit, 
investing in leadership development to role-model our beliefs, and 
ensuring systems, processes and milestone activities are aligned with 
the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’. We measure our progress and identify where to 
take action via a bi-annual employee survey called ‘Spirit Beat’. In our 
latest Spirit Beat survey in April 2024, we had an 88% response rate and 
strong scores in engagement, connection to purpose, and Spirit.

Note:
1. The Team Spirit Index represents an overall view of how people are doing on the ‘Spirit 
of Vodafone’ and takes into account each of our Spirit Behaviours. It allows us to understand 
how successful we have been in embedding these behaviours when working with each other, 
our customers, and the communities in which we operate.
The ‘Spirit Beat’ survey measures our progress on culture change with 
a focus on supporting employees to deliver our priorities of 
Customers, Simplicity and Growth through Spirit. The ‘Spirit Beat’ 
results show that teams are becoming more engaged, connected to 
our strategy, and have clarity on their goals. Managers who act on 
Spirit outperform those who do not take action by 20 points on Team 
Spirit Index and 26 points on Engagement. We support our managers 
to lead with Spirit and continue to take action on survey results 
through development programmes, training and resources. In 
November 2023, over 900 managers attended training on taking 
action on Spirit. 
We continue to evolve our employee listening strategy and deepen the 
connection between employee and customer experiences. As 
Vodafone transforms, we use pulse surveys to measure the 
understanding of our strategy; between June and September 2023, 
84% of teams understood and 80% were connected to our strategy. 
Onboarding feedback shows new hires are connected to our strategy 
and 87% reflect Spirit behaviours, while 84% positively rated their 
onboarding experience. Feedback shows that 69% of leavers would 
recommend Vodafone as a great place to work. 
To improve customer experience, we have deepened our 
understanding of our frontline colleague experience. Spirit Beat 
results from April 2024 showed the Engagement score was 75% and 
Team Spirit Index 85%. Outsourced contractors who serve our 
customers also had an opportunity to participate in ‘Spirit Beat’: 65% 
responded, an increase of nine percentage points from May 2023. 
Insights obtained have been used to inform our overall customer 
action plan, designed to improve the frontline and customer experience. 
‘Spirit of Vodafone Day’ takes place once a quarter with dedicated 
time to focus on connecting with our customers. During those days, 
learning hours increase on average by two times compared to other 
days in the year. Employees use the ‘Spirit of Vodafone Day’ to connect 
with the customer experience through customer-focused learning and 
local activities. 
Diverse talent and skills
The Vodafone Learning Organisation (‘VLO’) operates across all our 
operations to deliver high-quality learning that supports diverse talent 
to develop the skills required to transform Vodafone. This is reflected 
in the four strategic pillars summarised below.
1. Enable a high-impact performance and learning culture
We continue to support the professional growth of people through 
online learning. This year our learning and career development 
platform ‘Grow with Vodafone’ was recognised in the Learning 
Technologies Awards, winning gold for ‘Best Learning Technologies 
Project – Commercial Sector’, and silver for ‘Best Advance in Learning 
Management Technology’ at the Brandon Hall Excellence awards. 
During the year, our employees spent 2.7 million hours on learning, 
with an average of 225,000 hours per month. The annual average 
number of hours per employee has increased by 74% since FY23, 
with each employee now spending 32 hours on average per annum 
on their learning. We invested an average of €386 in both mandatory 
and non-mandatory training for each employee to build future capabilities. 
In April 2023, we launched a new performance management 
framework called ‘Grow my Impact’ to align employee goals to 
strategic priorities and assess performance based on individual 
impact. Grow my Impact introduced a mid-year check-in to 
encourage managers to have growth and career conversations with 
their direct reports and provide feedback on how they are tracking 
against their goals. We also refreshed our talent rating framework to 
support consistent decision-making. The new framework allows us to 
recognise a larger population of individuals with potential for bigger, 
more complex roles and to better differentiate between types of 
potential to provide tailored and value-adding development support 
to distinct groups. This also includes identifying those of our 
employees with critical skills. To emphasise that leaders are 
accountable for strengthening talent across Vodafone, all leaders 
must now have a ‘Grow Others’ goal. To recognise varying levels of 
impact and talent, year-end ratings drive reward outcomes for bonus 
and share awards for eligible employees. Eligibility to receive a bonus 
is underpinned by minimum performance standards that include the 
completion of our compliance training called ‘Doing What’s Right’. 
2. Build the skills for the future
This year we launched and delivered our ‘Skill Accelerators Labs’ 
across the organisation to develop critical skills such as agile project 
management, software engineering, automation, and cyber security. 
8,000 employees have already completed these programmes. In May 
2023 we also introduced a global software engineering reskilling 
programme to equip employees to move into a new role within 
Vodafone. Our technical career path (‘TCP’) supports the attraction, 
retention and development of our technical experts and sits alongside 
a leadership career path. The TCP is designed to provide more formal 
ways to recognise and reward technical experts, giving choice in 
career direction.
Following our FY23 review of our leaders’ commercial capabilities, 
current and future leaders were assessed against the skills we need 
for the future and targeted development and learning plans were 
subsequently created to close any gaps. To enable the development 
of broader skills, we continue to launch and refresh content with 
licensing partners, accessed by 28,000 employees this year.

careers.vodafone.com/life-at-vodafone/projects-stories
3. Drive an efficient engine with the scale and expertise to 
deliver our growth ambitions
We continue to simplify VLO operations by scaling training 
partnerships with vendors and consolidating duplicate work into our 
expanded _VOIS shared services team. We also conduct global 
demand planning to ensure our learning investments reinforce our 
strategic objectives.

4. Engage and retain diverse talent, and unlock potential 
through focused succession and people development
Our Group Chief Executive and Chief Human Resources Officer conducted 
a series of Succession and Talent Acceleration Review (‘STARs’) 
meetings with the market and functional CEOs and HR Directors 
during the year. These meetings discussed the Senior Leadership 
Team (‘SLT’) succession plan for employees identified as key talent.
Those in the ExCo succession and talent acceleration pool, which 
includes 44% women, receive one-to-one support, including 
leadership assessment, development planning, and coaching. 
To strengthen our market or functional CEO succession pipeline, we 
have also established a programme to support 15 senior leaders who 
have the potential to become a CEO in the next three to five years 
obtain the skills, experience, and exposure required. 
To increase our understanding of employees identified as key talent 
across the rest of the business, 167 senior leaders at senior 
management level completed leadership development assessments 
to help inform talent decisions. They also attended development 
planning sessions to grow their impact and prepare for future roles. 
Leadership development
Leadership is essential to enabling transformation, and we continually 
invest in developing inclusive leaders who drive growth and 
innovation, act as role models, coach and empower teams, and 
lead with Spirit. Programmes delivered this year include: 
 – ‘Vodafone Leader Labs’, attended by our top 182 ExCo and SLT leaders 
to enable the leadership shifts required to deliver our strategy;
 – ‘Leading for Customer Loyalty’, attended by leaders to deepen their 
connection with customers and shape a customer-centric culture; and
 – ‘CEO Accelerator Lab’, attended by 11 market CEOs to support their 
transition as newly appointed CEOs. This included assessments, 
one-to-one coaching, leadership training and business mentoring. 
To complement these programmes, leaders also use coaching and 
assessment tools digitally and on-the-go.
Digital and personalised experience
Office space
The shift to hybrid working has redefined the role of the office and inspired 
us to create a new global office design primarily for collaboration and 
connection. We have improved the digital workplace experience with new 
booking systems for desks and collaboration spaces, access control, video 
conferencing and presentation facilities. Last year we opened an innovation 
campus in Málaga in collaboration with the University of Málaga; we 
refurbished a listed building to update it to the newest technology. 
Employees work there with university students, fostering greater 
opportunities to collaborate on innovations. This is a great example of the 
hybrid workplace improving employees’ experience and attracting talent. 
We continued to enable remote working through our ‘Office in a Box’ 
initiative, which was implemented to support employees’ wellbeing 
while working from home. This provides a virtual office set-up at 
home following a self-assessment. 
Digital experience
We remain focussed on digitally transforming the people experience 
and evolving ways of working to accelerate the execution of the 
people strategy and deliver simplicity, efficiency and an enhanced 
experience across people processes. This has been driven by global 
initiatives across the people life cycle. 
The award-winning Artificial Intelligence (‘AI’) enabled Grow with 
Vodafone platform continued to create hiring efficiencies and optimise 
the recruiter, hiring manager and candidate experience, enabling:
 – Increased diversity through tailoring job recommendations for 
candidates and removing bias through anonymous candidate 
recommendations;
 – Improved recruiter efficiency through simplified navigation between 
tools and candidate recommendations based on required skills. 
This resulted in a reduction in time-to-hire from 50 days to 48 days; and
 – A simplified and faster application process through personalised 
skills-based job recommendations and a 78% reduction in questions. 
This resulted in 78% of applications moving to submission stage.
To attract, retain and support diverse talent more consistently, this 
year a new global talent acquisition policy was launched and our 
onboarding tool was also enhanced with new features to provide a 
simpler and more personalised experience for new joiners, driving 
engagement. This is enabled by automated and tailored notifications, 
including the use of SMS in the UK, which has led to a journey 
effectiveness score of 87%. 
A key priority for Vodafone is having a clear and robust strategic 
workforce-planning process. As a result, we implemented a simple 
and secure global headcount planning tool to improve accuracy, 
reduce manual time and effort, and enable closer collaboration 
between those involved in the process. The tool is available in 
majority of markets and Group functions1, allowing users access to 
gain experience with the new system. 
To improve the speed and effectiveness of HR admin support for 
employee queries and transactions, our HR chatbot has been scaled 
and is now adopted across Vodacom, _VOIS India, the UK, Group UK, 
Romania, and _VOIS Romania. The chatbot receives 67% of queries 
across all channels, with an average first-time resolution of 53% and 
an employee Net Promoter Score of 75. 
We are closely following AI and Generative AI advancements in the 
market and, based on pilot findings, we are working with multiple 
external experts to harness the potential for integration with HR 
processes. The top four use cases selected include: automating query 
resolution; driving deeper people data insights; enhancing learning 
and talent acquisition content and removing bias; using AI-enabled 
search and recommendations to find the best candidates, as well as 
learning content and career opportunities for employees. 
We are enhancing the people data analytics team’s capability with the 
implementation of a global HR data lake using Google Cloud Platform. 
This is now live for all markets except Germany and enables standardised 
insights and dashboards, reducing the need for manual reporting. This 
is supported by high-quality people data managed through a data 
quality tool, which checks and corrects HR data against pre-set rules, 
with 100% error resolution since its launch in FY23. 
To complement the changes in the digital ecosystem, we have 
continued to invest in our ways of working. We introduced a global 
service model for the hiring of employees at executive management 
level (SLT and senior managers), which has led to a more standardised 
and efficient process. We are also transforming the HR business 
partnering support model in an agreed set of markets to improve its 
effectiveness. HR business partners will focus on strategic activities, 
while transactional HR activities will transfer to _VOIS. 
To optimise HR services, we continue to re-locate activities conducted 
in markets (including selected learning and development tasks and 
resourcing admin tasks) to _VOIS. This will improve service quality at 
scale while creating savings of €0.6 million. A transformation plan was 
also executed to ensure _VOIS readiness to receive the activity in 
preparation for the future service offering.
Note:

Group Corporate Functions, Group Technology, Lesotho, Portugal, Romania, South Africa, 
Tanzania, Turkey, and the UK.

Pay and benefits
As part of the people experience, we continue to ensure pay, benefits 
and wellbeing propositions are competitive and fair. Pay is typically 
reviewed on an annual basis, with increases aligned to an individual’s 
level of skills and experience, as well as external factors like market 
competition and inflation. Our total reward approach also encourages 
collective performance and ‘in-the-moment’ recognition. For example, 
22,253 peer-to-peer ‘Thank You’s’ and 58,951 cash ‘Vodafone Star’ 
awards were issued through a digital recognition tool during the year. 
We continue to apply Fair Pay principles across all markets, working 
with the WageIndicator Foundation to ensure a good standard of 
living in each market. In the UK, our commitment to these principles is 
reflected in being an Accredited Living Wage employer.

can be found in the ESG Addendum Methodology document: investors.vodafone.com/
esgmethodology. Calculation considers pro-rated headcount.
2. Other Europe reflects employees based in Albania, Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, 
and Romania. Africa reflects employees based in Vodacom Group, including Egypt.
3. Shared Operations constitute a significant number of employees. The figures presented 
above include _VOIS headcount across our footprint (Albania, Egypt, Hungary, India, Portugal, 
Romania, Turkey and Spain).
4. More detail on the employee survey is included on page 15. The employee engagement 
index is based on an average index of responses to three questions: satisfaction working at 
Vodafone; experiencing positive emotions at work; and recommending us as an employer. 
Alignment to purpose is based on a single question that asks whether employees feel their 
daily work contributes significantly to Vodafone’s purpose. Employee engagement index and 
purpose alignment scores reflect April 2024 and May 2023 data.
5. The voluntary turnover rate includes retirements and death in service. Further information on 
how voluntary and involuntary turnover has been calculated is included in the ESG Addendum 
Methodology document: investors.vodafone.com/esgmethodology.
Simplified operating model
We continued to simplify our operating model. For example, the 
establishment of the Vodafone Shared Operations business, which will sell 
and deliver a portfolio of services to Group, operating companies, and other 
customers, via an arm’s length commercial model based on Price x Quantity 
x Quality of Service. Separately, the Internet of Things (‘IoT’) Managed 
Connectivity business is becoming a separate, standalone company within 
Vodafone Group that will offer access to the Global Data Service Platform 
(‘GDSP’) Managed Connectivity segment to Vodafone and new customers. 
Where aspects of this internal re-organisation of Vodafone’s global IoT 
business require notification and regulatory approval, we will be working 
closely with the relevant authorities to obtain the necessary clearances. We 
are also creating a unified global Vodafone Business team with our business 
teams in operating companies to streamline prioritisation and decision-
making for our products and services. 
Employee engagement
We have a number of employee forums where elected employee 
delegates represent the views of their colleagues. During the year, the 
Board’s Workforce Engagement Leads, Delphine Ernotte Cunci and 
Christine Ramon, attended employee forums, such as the European 
Employee Consultative Committee and the Vodacom Employee 
Engagement Forum, to gather employee views. Key discussion topics 
from the meetings included business development, customer 
experience, growth, and reskilling opportunities.
The Group Chief Executive updates employees regularly on how we 
are embedding and progressing our strategy and this is through a 
variety of channels, including our internal digital platform ‘Workplace’. 
These announcements include any changes to our market portfolio, 
services, and organisation. Recently employees were informed of 
changes to simplify our Executive Committee structure whereby all 
European markets are now under the CEO of European Markets, and 
joint ventures, partner markets, and telecom partnerships are now 
consolidated under the CEO Vodafone Investments. Alongside the 
Chief Commercial Officer and CEO Vodafone Italy; CEO Vodacom 
Group; and, CEO Vodafone Business, these form the five Executive 
Committee customer-facing units.
Read more about the Board’s engagement with the  
employee voice on pages 77-78, and 83
Workers’ councils and union engagement
We respect freedom of association and recognise the rights of employees 
to join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining in accordance 
with local law. We continue to maintain strong relationships with workers’ 
councils and unions through their representatives, and we have 13,224 
people covered by collective bargaining agreements across our global 
footprint. Vodafone Germany employees, all covered by collective 
agreements signed with unions, can register and participate in trade 
union activities. They can elect or be elected into various union roles at 
a local or national level. Across FY24, Vodafone Germany completed 
more than 160 agreements across all levels1, with a focus on the 
introduction of new IT tools, working conditions and transformation. 
The latter includes a refreshed performance management framework.
Workplace equality
As part of our purpose, we aim to make the world more connected, 
inclusive, sustainable, and a place where everyone can truly be 
themselves and belong. 
Diversity and inclusion
Our aim is to create an inclusive and equitable workplace for all. This year 
we have sustained momentum on gender equality, accelerated focus 
on LGBT+, race and ethnicity, and taken actions to better understand the 
experience of neurodiverse people in the workplace. Our focus on inclusion 
supports our ambition to create a global workforce that reflects the 
customers, communities and colleagues we serve, and the wider 
societies in which we operate. We believe that embedding equity and 
inclusion to enable diversity is critical to achieving these goals in a 
sustainable way.

Embedding inclusion
Multiple employee networks operate across Vodafone including 
Women, VodAbility, LGBT+ Friends, Parents & Carers and Multicultural 
Inclusion. We actively support them, and this year we provided 29 
network chairs and sponsors with specific leadership development 
training focused on how to effectively create and assess a network’s 
strategy, as well as how to be a visible and effective sponsor. Global 
Withstander training continues to be delivered in 11 languages to upskill 
employees on how to become active allies by challenging negative and 
inappropriate behaviours when they witness them. Over 74% of employees 
and 91% of managers completed the training in FY24. We continued 
to engage with colleagues and raise awareness of why inclusion matters. 
During the year, we held global sessions on diversity and inclusion 
topics and these received over 10,0001 viewers across all markets.
Gender diversity
Goal: We aim to have 40% women in management roles by 2030.
We have reached 35%, which is on track towards our ambition. We continue 
to drive progress through programmes, policies and leadership incentives.

headcount. Further information on how employees are defined and calculated can be found 
in the ESG Addendum Methodology document: investors.vodafone.com/esgmethodology. 
We work to ensure there is gender diversity when resourcing for 
senior leadership roles, and our leadership team is accountable for 
maintaining diversity and inclusion in their teams. Women in 
management targets are also embedded in our long-term incentive 
plans. 
Across youth programmes, 49% of hires were women. We have also 
now connected with over 15,000 girls via the digital skills programme 
‘Code Like a Girl’ since 2017. We support managers on inclusive hiring 
practices through training and by embedding inclusion in our talent 
acquisition systems. This includes the introduction of blind CVs, which 
exclude personal details such as the candidate’s gender and age. 
Domestic violence
Our global domestic violence policy sets out comprehensive workplace 
resources, support, security, paid safe leave and other measures for 
employees at risk of experiencing, and recovering from, domestic violence 
and abuse. We expanded our support by creating an allyship programme 
for domestic abuse survivors. This expands training beyond HR and line 
managers to all employees, including our frontline workforce, on how 
to recognise the signs of abuse, respond, and refer survivors to support.
Menopause
Our external research identified that 62% of women with symptoms 
of menopause found that it impacted their work. We are committed  
to supporting women experiencing menopause, including providing 
a global toolkit, which is freely available to download externally, and 
menopause e-learning on common symptoms’ impact to work.
Our people strategy (continued) 
Maternity and parental leave
Our global maternity and parental leave policies are available across 
markets, providing 16 weeks of fully paid leave with a phased return 
to work over six months, where parents work the equivalent of four 
days and are paid for five days. This policy is open to all employees 
regardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, length of service, 
and whether they or their partner is having a baby, or they are 
welcoming a child through surrogacy or adoption. This year, over 
2,300 women have taken our maternity leave and over 2,500 men 
have taken parental leave, with 72% of the latter taking four or more 
weeks of leave. Of those who identify as LGBT+, 5% have taken 
parental leave. In addition, 70% of employees remained with 
Vodafone 12 months after their return from parental leave.
LGBT+
We accelerated our focus on supporting our LGBT+ community with 
2,700 allies and active support from senior executive sponsors. For 
the first time we included the question ‘Are you out at work?’ as part 
of our Spirit Beat survey to better understand experiences of our 
LGBT+ employees in the workplace2. 44%3 of our LGBT+ community 
are out at work. To further support them, we launched a guide for 
managers and colleagues to support employees coming out in the 
workplace and have also updated our LGBT+ travel toolkit advising on 
safe travel. In addition, we launched the pronoun functionality in 
Microsoft Teams and Outlook on the web; this gives employees the 
option to easily add their preferred pronouns to their profile. The 
Vodafone Foundation continues to promote the Zoteria app in the 
UK, which helps the LGBT+ community and the wider public to come 
together and tackle the issue of LGBT+ hate crime.
Accessibility in the workplace
During the year, we upskilled our people through continued promotion 
of and education about the accessibility features available within 
Microsoft 365. We also have accessibility guidelines, which are reinforced 
through workshops and training for developers. Assessments continue 
to be conducted to improve the accessibility of our own products. 
We have seven sessions available and hosted a podcast to promote 
accessibility in the digital workplace.
Vodafone took part in research to understand the experience of 
neurodiverse people in technology, along with Colt, Samsung, and Nokia, 
as part of the #ChangeTheFace alliance. The aim was to provide 
insights for employers to support neurodiverse people in the workplace.
Race, ethnicity and cultural heritage (‘REACH’)
We continue to promote greater workplace inclusion through allyship and 
anti-racism. REACH executive sponsors continued to be appointed across 
our markets, and REACH fluency training continued to be adapted to local 
contexts and rolled out in our European markets. This year, we extended 
the McKinsey Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino Leadership Programmes to 
all our markets with over 500 signing up to the sessions so far. In 2020, we 
set ethnic diversity targets at leadership level, presented below.

Leadership diversity
To better understand representation across the organisation and 
inform our diversity and inclusion programmes, we use ‘#CountMeIn’, 
an initiative that encourages employees to voluntarily self-declare 
their diversity demographics. These include race, ethnicity, disability, 
sexual orientation, gender identity, and caring responsibilities, in line 
with local privacy and legal requirements1. Our senior leadership 
positions have the highest self-declaration rate at 75%, and this 
enables transparency about our diversity at senior leadership level.

4. Self-identification of disability, including long-term conditions and visible and non-visible disabilities.
Policies, initiatives and targets
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion is reflected across our 
global policies and principles, such as our code of conduct and fair 
pay principles.

Vodafone: vodafone.com/fair-pay
Read more about our Fair Pay 
principles on page 113
The achievement of our diversity targets is dependent on the 
attraction, engagement and retention of diverse talent and skills. To 
support this, we have inclusive initiatives such as: hybrid and flexible 
working, parental leave, a mental health toolkit, learning and 
development programmes, allyship training, and menopause support, 
reinforced by the work of employee networks and executive sponsors. 
We refreshed our training for hiring managers and recruiters to 
support an inclusive candidate experience from application to offer 
stage. Programmes are designed to help employees through all life 
stages and challenge societal norms to create an environment where 
everyone can contribute at their best and thrive.

experience on pages 15 and 16
Safety, health and wellbeing
Nothing is more important to us than the safety, health, and wellbeing 
(‘SHW’) of our customers, communities, employees, and suppliers. We 
have a simple global commitment: no one gets hurt. This has been 
captured in our refreshed Global Commitment Statement which is 
supported by a video message from our Group CEO.
Our SHW framework provides a consistent approach to safety leadership, 
planning, performance monitoring, governance, and assurance. 
Risks
We continue to focus on our key risks, which account for the majority 
of reported incidents and remain amongst our top priorities: 
occupational road risk, falls from height, working with electricity, 
and civil works.
In recognition of our key risks, we continue to use the ‘Vodafone 
Absolute Rules’. These rules focus on risks that present the greatest 
potential for harm for anyone working for or on behalf of Vodafone. 
The Absolute Rules apply everywhere we work and provide clear 
expectations for safe behaviour for everyone to follow. The Absolute 
Rules must be followed by all Vodafone employees and contractors, 
as well as our suppliers’ employees and contractors. Where this 
requirement is not met, we take appropriate management action. In 
the April 2024 Spirit Beat survey 94% of employees agreed that the 
Absolute Rules are taken seriously at Vodafone.
Leadership engagement
Our Group Executive Commmitee (‘ExCo’) and operating company ExCo’s 
provide visible and clear leadership in SHW. Our senior leaders are 
actively engaged and carry out regular face-to-face safety 
engagement throughout the year. Our leaders recognise the 
importance of connecting with teams and frontline workers as they 
continue to maintain our networks and work in our retail stores and on 
customer sites. We encourage our people to raise any concerns or 
ideas for improvements in SHW and ensure the support of our leaders 
when they do so. 
We continue to mandate our ‘Leading for Health & Safety at Work’ 
e-learning module. This module sets out the specific impact we 
expect our leaders to have. On 31 March 2024, 93%2 of assigned 
leaders had completed the module.
Supplier engagement
Most of our high risk work is carried out by suppliers on our behalf. 
Engagement and collaboration is essential to achieve our common 
goal of protecting people. We have held quarterly forums with our 
global suppliers for the last 10 years to develop common ways of 
working and share best practice. This year we held four in-person 
safety forums with our larger global suppliers. This year our forums 
have worked on collaboration with suppliers via work streams on 
improving how work is supervised on site, improving driver safety, and 
managing the risk of sub-contracting.
Community engagement
We play an active role in the communities where we conduct our business 
and as a result we have various community focused safety programmes.
In Mozambique, a road safety campaign was conducted. The 
campaign involved the Chairman of the Mozambican Traffic Police, 
and the Vodafone Mozambique safety team. The event took place in 
the main transport corridor at critical points identified with a higher 
occurrence of accidents.
In Lesotho, a radio campaign was run focusing on Vodacom Absolute 
Rules and pedestrian safety, with the key message ‘#NoOneGetsHurt’. 
This was aired on five national radio stations over three weeks.
In Tanzania, we worked with five selected primary schools that were 
identified as exposed to high road risk. Our road-education 
programme reached 6,745 students and 100 junior traffic patrol 
officers were appointed and trained. 
In Greece, road safety events were held during April and May in 
collaboration with the Road Safety Institute. More than 550 
employees, building tenants, and children participated in safety 
training using simulators. We also installed automated external 
defibrillators in six of our premises, which are available to all tenants.
Governance
SHW is managed through a global framework. This includes the 
monitoring and assessing of risks, setting targets, reviewing progress, 
and reporting performance. Our global framework is based on 
international standards for occupational health and safety. It is 
aligned to internationally recognised best practice and always meets 
or exceeds local requirements. In addition, five of our European local 
markets, one Vodacom market, and four _VOIS locations have chosen 
to undergo independent external certification to ISO 45001, the 
international standard for occupational health and safety. 
All incidents relating to key risks or breaches of the Vodafone 
Absolute Rules are reported and investigated within the timescales 
contained in our Incident Reporting Standard. We ensure that

Our people strategy (continued) 
incidents are investigated in accordance with their severity, and 
appropriate remedial actions and improvements are identified and 
implemented. We strongly believe in the importance of prevention 
and we also believe that every incident should be treated as an 
opportunity for learning and improvement.
SHW is a global policy and is included within our global risk and 
compliance governance programme. This year we continued 
in-country audits and remote validation continued as a 
complementary process. Our eight audits focused on the control of 
contractors and lifting operations across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Six 
additional visits were made to our Europe and Africa markets to focus 
on engagement and communication. They included a combination of 
team meetings, site visits with contractors and suppliers and, where 
applicable, verification checks following any serious incidents.
Training
We continue to include a health and safety module as part of our 
mandatory ‘Doing What’s Right’ training. Every employee must 
complete the training within six weeks of joining and then follow our 
learning intervention cycle. During FY24, 96% of assigned Vodafone 
employees completed the health and safety module. 
Each local market is also responsible for delivering training that 
supports the development of appropriate leadership skills, behaviours, 
and identification of risks. Additional training is specific to an 
individual’s role and aligned to each market’s local legislation.
Key performance indicators
We have a global set of key performance indicators which are reported 
monthly to the Group ExCo and bi-annually to the Board:
 – Number of fatalities;
 – Number of employee lost-time incidents (‘LTIs’); and
 – Near misses.
All fatalities that may be connected with our activities in any way, 
including those affecting employees, suppliers and members of the 
public, are formally reported to the Group’s ExCo and to the Board by 
the Head of Safety, Health and Wellbeing. 
Each incident is investigated to determine the facts and any actions 
required to prevent recurrence. The investigation’s findings are 
reviewed by the Chief Human Resources Officer at a formal review 
meeting to ensure the thoroughness of the investigation, the 
suitability of corrective and preventive actions, and to determine 
whether the fatal accident was within Vodafone’s control or not. All 
fatalities determined to be within Vodafone’s control are considered 
‘recordable’ and are publicly reported.
Fatal accidents from FY20 onwards which had not reached 
determination of recordability, due to ongoing legal processes, were 
reviewed during FY24. Of these events three were determined to be 
within Vodafone control and therefore recordable. The incidents were a 
road traffic accident in Turkey in FY21, a fall from height in Italy in 
FY22, and a gas explosion in Germany in FY23. There are no fatal 
accidents awaiting determination from prior years.
Our aim is to ensure no one gets hurt. Any loss of life related to our 
operations is unacceptable. It is therefore with great regret that we 
record two fatal accidents this year. 
The first recordable fatality occurred in South Africa when a supplier’s 
vehicle struck a child that ran into the path of the vehicle. The injured 
child was taken to hospital but sadly died. Support for the child’s 
family has been provided in line with cultural and contractual 
requirements via our supplier. The investigation identified that our 
suppliers control of its fleet and driver operations required 
improvement. Our supplier control and monitoring process had not 
identified those weaknesses in these supplier’s controls prior to the 
incident. Additional audits of field operations vehicle maintenance 
and driver monitoring programmes are being undertaken as is 
consequence management of the supplier company.
The second recordable fatality occurred in Mozambique when a 
supplier technician fell from height. The technician was working at 
the top of a tower when a bee swarm began to sting him. As he 
descended he detached himself from his fall protection harness, went 
into shock at around seven metres and then fell to ground level. The 
review identified that the controls for managing natural hazards such 
as bees could be improved. A safety directive to prohibit work in the 
presence of bees has since been mandated across all Vodacom 
markets. An industry leading innovative rescue from height practice 
has been created by Vodafone and is being implemented across all 
markets to allow safe descent even when incapacitated. Specialist 
contractors are being used to remove bee swarms and only such 
specialist contractors are permitted to work in the presence of bees. 
Lost-time incident (‘LTI’) is the term we use when an employee or contractor 
is injured while carrying out a work-related task and is consequently unable 
to perform their regular duties for a complete shift or period of time after the 
incident. During the year, 18 employee and contractors LTIs were reported. 
In total these incidents account for 164 lost workdays.

Notes:
1. Lost-time incident means the loss of one or more workdays as a result of injury.
2. During FY24, an internal investigation into an incident during the year ending 31 March 2023 concluded 
and an additional fatality is reported. This has been reflected in the reported figure for FY23. 
Wellbeing
We remain focused on mental health and wellbeing. Training 
and services are available in each market, including the provision of 
employee assistance and psychological support services.
Our global wellbeing framework includes pillars for mental health, 
physical health, and financial management. The framework is a guide 
to help our people achieve optimal wellbeing and to ensure we all 
have access to the best possible wellbeing resources across Vodafone. 
Globally we delivered two online sessions on mental health to the Vodafone 
Global Youth Connect Community (over 500 attendees). Youth Connect is 
a network of over 20,000 under-30’s from across Vodafone’s markets. 
In the UK, we continued the professional development of our Mental 
Health First Aider Network, providing bi-monthly support and 
education to over 300 trained volunteers. We delivered wellbeing 
education to over 1,200 employees through online training and 
face-to-face courses on anxiety, mindfulness and financial planning. 
In Albania, Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of the Congo we 
organised sessions on financial balance.
In South Africa, we launched a campaign during Mental Health Week, 
consisting of personal mental health journeys together with our 
wellbeing ambassadors. We placed primary healthcare nurses in our 
four smaller regional clinics. We also launched mental health people 
leader training. We hosted sessions throughout the year on a range of 
topics including living a purposeful life, financial wellbeing, mental 
health, mental illness, healthy boundaries, and suicide awareness.

Other information

 – Total revenue: Declined by 2.5% to €36.7 billion due to the disposals of Vantage Towers, Vodafone Hungary and Vodafone Ghana in the prior 
financial year and adverse exchange rate movements.
 – Service revenue: Decreased by 1.3%, however on an organic basis, increased by 6.3%, with Europe, Africa and Business all growing. Excluding 
Turkey, the Group had good service revenue growth of +3.7% on an organic basis.
 – Operating profit: Decreased by 74.6% to €3.7 billion primarily reflects business disposals in the prior financial year, in particular the €8.6 billion 
gain on disposal of Vantage Towers.
 – Adjusted EBITDAaL: Increased by 2.2% on an organic basis as good service revenue progress was partially offset by higher energy costs and 
other inflationary impacts. Excluding Turkey, adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 0.6% on an organic basis.
 – Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 4.45 eurocents, compared to basic earnings per share of 43.66 
eurocents in the prior year, primarily due to lower operating profit. Adjusted basic earnings per share was 7.47 eurocents, compared to 11.28 
eurocents in the prior year, primarily due to lower adjusted EBITDAaL.
 – Discontinued operations: Following the announcement that we entered into binding sale agreements with respect to the sales of Vodafone 
Spain and Vodafone Italy, both businesses are now reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements.

Growth
Total revenue decreased by 1.2% to €13.0 billion, driven by lower equipment revenue. Service revenue grew by 0.2% (Q3: 0.3%, Q4: 0.6%) as the 
contribution from higher broadband ARPU was largely offset by the cumulative impact of broadband and TV customer losses and lower regulated 
rates for terminating mobile calls. Growth improved in Q4, as higher consumer mobile ARPU and customer base growth was partially offset by a 
0.9 percentage point impact from the end to bulk TV contracting in Multi Dwelling Units (‘MDUs’). 
Fixed service revenue increased by 0.3% (Q3: 1.0%, Q4: -0.2%) as broadband ARPU growth was partially offset by the impact of a lower broadband 
and TV customer base. The slowdown in fixed service revenue growth in Q4 was primarily driven by a 1.7 percentage point impact from changes 
to German TV laws. Mobile service revenue was stable year-on-year (Q3: -0.5%, Q4: +1.8%) as ARPU growth and higher roaming and visitor 
revenue were offset by a lower prepaid customer base and a reduction in mobile termination rates. Mobile service revenue growth in Q4 improved 
having lapped the renewal and rephasing of a large multi-year IoT contract last year, which had adversely impacted prior quarters. Mobile service 
revenue growth in Q4 was also supported by higher IoT project revenue, consumer contract ARPU growth, and a higher customer base. Vodafone 
Business service revenue was stable year-on-year (Q3: -1.9%, Q4: +1.0%) as good demand for fixed services, including cloud and security, was 
offset by a strong prior year performance in public sector and lower IoT revenue following the renewal of a major multi-year IoT automotive 
contract in the prior year. 
Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 5.8%, reflecting a 2.7 percentage point impact from higher energy costs. The decline also reflected higher wage, 
inflation-linked lease costs, and customer acquisition costs, as well as investments made to support the MDU transition. The Adjusted EBITDAaL 
margin was 1.9 percentage points lower year-on-year at 38.7%.
Customers
During the year, we re-engineered our commercial model and launched a number of new products and services to better serve our customers. In 
broadband, we restored our market leading network quality position. This was reflected in four major independent network test results from 
Connect, CHIP, Computer BILD and nPerf where we achieved leading quality and reliability scores. Reflecting inflationary pressure, we have 
increased the price of our broadband packages. As expected, this impacted our commercial performance with our broadband customer base 
declining by 392,000 during the year. Our converged customer base increased by 99,000 to 2.4 million. 
Ahead of changes to German TV laws, which take effect from July 2024 and change the practice of bulk TV contracting in MDUs, we have started 
migrating end users to new contracts at scale. Based on our experience to date, we expect to retain around 50% of the 8.5 million MDU TV 
households. At the end of March 2024, we had already actively retained 1.9 million households. Our total TV customer base declined by 1.0 
million during the year, primarily due to the MDU transition, which began in the last quarter of FY24.
We added 239,000 new mobile contract customers in FY24, supported by our new propositions, the ongoing optimisation of sales channels and 
an improved performance of Vodafone’s own brands. We also added 8.0 million IoT connections, driven by continued strong demand from the 
automotive sector. During the year, we agreed a long-term national roaming partnership with 1&1. We expect to deliver mobile coverage 
nationwide to 1&1’s customers from the second half of the 2024 calendar year. Our fibre-to-the-home (‘FTTH’) joint venture, OXG Glasfaser, 
started its network rollout during the year, initially in Neuss, Düsseldorf, Marburg and Kassel. OXG Glasfaser will deploy FTTH to up to seven million 
homes over a six-year period and is complementary to our upgrade plans for our existing hybrid fibre cable network.

Growth
Total revenue increased by 0.2% to €6.8 billion as service revenue growth 
was offset by a decline in equipment revenue. Service revenue increased by 
5.1% (Q3: 5.5%, Q4: 6.8%). Organic growth in service revenue increased by 
5.0% (Q3: 5.2%, Q4: 3.6%), driven by continued strong growth in the 
Consumer and Business segments. The lower service revenue growth in Q4 
was driven by Business following strong project revenue in prior periods.
Mobile service revenue grew by 5.4% (Q3: 5.8%, Q4: 6.8%). Organic 
growth in mobile service revenue was 5.4% (Q3: 5.4%, Q4: 3.7%), driven 
by good commercial momentum, annual price increases, and higher 
roaming revenue, partially offset by the migration of the Virgin Media 
MVNO off our network. The lower growth in Q4 was driven by a strong 
Business performance in prior periods. Fixed service revenue grew by 
4.1% (Q3: 4.6%, Q4: 7.0%). Organic growth in fixed service revenue was 
3.9% (Q3: 4.6%, Q4: 3.5%) driven by good Consumer customer base growth. 
Vodafone Business service revenue increased by 3.3% (Q3: 6.3%, Q4: 
2.6%). Organic growth in Vodafone Business service revenue was 3.2% 
(Q3: 5.8%, Q4: -0.5%), due to strong growth in mobile supported by 
annual price increases. Growth was also supported by our IoT business 
and during the year, we announced we will be providing IoT connectivity to 
Britain’s smart metering network through our partnership with Data 
Communications Company (‘DCC’). Fixed sales momentum continued 
to improve throughout the year. We also announced a new channel 
called Business IT Hubs, which is planning to establish 300 franchise 
partners to help SMEs better manage their IT solutions.
Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 4.3% in the year. On an organic basis, 
Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 4.0%, with strong service revenue 
growth, partially offset by a 1.8 percentage point impact from higher 
energy costs, and the migration of the Virgin Media MVNO off our 
network. The adjusted EBITDAaL margin improved by 0.8 percentage 
points year-on-year on a reported and organic basis to 20.6%.
Customers
During the year our mobile contract customer base continued to grow, 
however this was offset by low value disconnections in Business. In the 
second half of the year, we were recognised as a Consumer NPS 
co-leader in the market and we are now the joint lowest complained 
about mobile operator, as measured by Ofcom, reflecting the significant 
improvements and investment we have made to our customer experience 
over the last few years. Our digital prepaid sub-brand ‘VOXI’ continued 
to grow, with 120,000 customers added during the year. Through our 
partnerships with CityFibre and Openreach we can now reach 15.3 million 
households with full fibre broadband, more than any other provider in 
the UK. We are one of the fastest growing broadband providers in the 
UK and our broadband customer base increased by 160,000.
Portfolio
In June 2023, we announced a binding agreement to combine our UK 
business with Three UK to create a sustainable, and competitive third scaled 
network operator in the UK. Following the merger, which we expect to close 
around the end of the 2024 calendar year, Vodafone and CK Hutchison will 
own 51% and 49% of the combined business, respectively. This 
combination is expected to provide customers with greater choice 
and more value, drive greater competition, and enable increased 
investment with a clear £11 billion plan to create one of Europe’s most 
advanced standalone 5G networks.

1. Other Europe markets comprise Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Romania, Czech Republic and 
Albania. The comparative metrics include the results of Vodafone Hungary which, as 
previously reported, was sold in January 2023. 
2. Organic growth is a non-GAAP measure. See page 235 for more information. 
Growth
Total revenue declined by 4.2% to €5.5 billion, reflecting the disposal 
of Vodafone Hungary in the prior year. Service revenue decreased by 
5.7% (Q3: -7.8%, Q4: +0.3%). Organic growth in service revenue 
increased by 4.2% (Q3: 3.6%, Q4: 5.5%), with all six markets growing 
during the year, supported by good commercial momentum and our 
price actions in most markets. The acceleration in quarterly trends 
was driven by public sector project work.
In Portugal, both our Consumer and Business segments continued to 
perform well, also supported by inflation-linked contractual price 
increases implemented in March 2023. In Ireland, service revenue 
increased, driven by a higher average customer base, and supported 
by our annual contractual price increases. Service revenue in Greece 
grew, reflecting strong demand for Business fixed services.
Vodafone Business service revenue increased by 0.4% (Q3: -1.3%, Q4: 
8.1%). Organic growth in Vodafone Business service revenue was 7.9% 
(Q3: 7.8%, Q4: 12.2%) during the year, with growth in both 
connectivity and digital services, including IoT and Cloud. Growth in 
connectivity was supported by a higher customer base, price 
increases in the Soho and SME customer segments across our 
markets and growth in digital services, with public sector contract 
wins in Romania.
Adjusted EBITDAaL decreased by 7.1% in the year. On an organic 
basis, Adjusted EBITDAaL grew by 1.5%, as service revenue growth 
and ongoing cost efficiencies were offset by the 0.6 percentage point 
impact from higher energy costs, as well as one-off bad debt impacts 
in relation to certain customer contracts in Greece. The Adjusted 
EBITDAaL margin decreased by 0.9 percentage points year-on-year 
(organic: -1.4 percentage points) at 27.5%.
Customers
During FY24, we maintained our good commercial momentum. In 
Portugal, we added 167,000 mobile contract customers and 58,000 
fixed broadband customers. In Ireland, our mobile contract customers 
base increased by 30,000. Through our fixed wholesale network 
access partnerships, we now cover over 1.4 million households in 
Ireland with FTTH. In Greece, we added 146,000 mobile contract 
customers, and our broadband customer base declined by 12,000.
Portfolio
In September 2022, we announced that we had entered into an 
agreement to buy Portugal’s fourth largest converged operator, Nowo 
Communications, from Llorca JVCO Limited, the owner of Masmovil 
Ibercom S.A. The transaction is conditional on regulatory approval. We 
submitted proposed remedies which were rejected in early 2024. 
After reviewing the competition authority’s comments and exploring 
further options to address the authority’s concerns, we submitted 
revised proposals that are currently being considered by the 
competition authority.

Notes:
1. The comparative metrics for FY23 have been re-presented to reflect the move of Vodafone 
Egypt to Vodacom from 1 April 2023 and the segment has been re-named Africa. 
2. Organic growth is a non-GAAP measure. See page 235 for more information. 
Growth
Total revenue declined by 8.1% to €7.4 billion due to the depreciation 
of local currencies versus the euro. Service revenue decreased by 
9.2% (Q3: -7.5%, Q4: +1.2%). Organic growth in service revenue grew 
by 9.2% (Q3: 8.8%, Q4: 10.0%) with growth in South Africa, Egypt and 
Vodacom’s international markets. 
In South Africa, service revenue growth was supported by the 
Consumer mobile contract segment, which benefited from a price 
increase in the first quarter, and good fixed line growth in Consumer 
and Business. Growth slowed in Q4 due to a strong prior year 
comparative, reflecting an acceleration in customer data usage during 
widespread power outages, and pressure on wholesale revenue. 
Financial services revenue grew by 7.9% to €156.9 million on an 
organic basis, supported by growth in our insurance services. 
Service revenue in Egypt grew strongly during the year and 
accelerated in Q4, above inflation. The acceleration was supported by 
sustained customer base growth, price increases in mobile and fixed, 
robust demand for data and strong growth in our financial services 
product, ‘Vodafone Cash’. Vodafone Cash revenue more than doubled 
in FY24 to €95.8 million.
In Vodacom’s international markets, service revenue growth was 
supported by a higher customer base and strong M-Pesa and data 
revenue growth. M-Pesa revenue grew by 13.4% on an organic basis 
and now represents 26.8% of service revenue.
Adjusted EBITDAaL declined by 11.8% during the year. On an organic 
basis, adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 6.4%, supported by service 
revenue growth and cost initiatives, partially offset by an increase in 
technology operating expenses associated with higher energy costs. 
The Adjusted EBITDAaL margin decreased by 1.5 percentage points 
year-on-year (organic: -1.1 percentage points) to 34.2%.
Customers
In South Africa, we added 125,000 contract customers in the year, 
and now have a mobile contract base of 6.8 million. We added 5.7 
million mobile prepaid SIMs in the year, supported by our big data led 
customer value management capabilities which offer personalised 
bundles to customers. Across our active customer base, 81.5% of our 
mobile customers now use data services, an increase of 3.3 million 
year-on-year. Our ‘VodaPay’ super-app continued to gain traction with 
5.8 million registered users.
In Egypt, we added 437,000 contract customers and 2.4 million 
prepaid mobile customers during the year, and we now have 48.3 
million customers. ‘Vodafone Cash’ now has 8.2 million active users 
with 2.8 million users added during the year. 
In Vodacom’s international markets, we added 4.0 million mobile 
customers and our mobile customer base is now 54.2 million, with 
63.5% of active customers using our data services.

2. Organic growth is a non-GAAP measure. See page 235 for more information. . 
Growth
Total revenue increased by 14.0% to €2.4 billion, with strong service 
revenue growth partly offset by a significant devaluation of the local 
currency and the disposal of Vodafone Ghana in the prior financial 
year. 
Despite material currency devaluation, service revenue increased in 
euro terms by 9.6% (Q3: 6.8%, Q4: 15.6%). Organic growth in service 
revenue in Turkey was 88.5% (Q3: 90.4%, Q4: 105.6%), driven by 
ongoing repricing actions to reflect the high inflationary environment 
and value accretive base management activities. 
Vodafone Business service revenue increased by 20.1% (Q3: 20.5%, 
Q4: 20.3%). Organic growth in Vodafone Business service revenue was 
87.4% (Q3: 94.7%, Q4: 102.2%) during the year, driven by higher 
connectivity revenue and strong Business demand for our cloud and 
IoT services. In February 2024, we announced our partnership with 
DAMAC to build a new data centre in Izmir. 
Adjusted EBITDAaL increased by 20.3% in the year, growing in euro 
terms during FY24. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDAaL in Turkey 
increased by 99.9%, supported by ongoing digitalisation and our 
continued focus on cost efficiency, in the context of significant 
inflationary pressure on our cost base. The Adjusted EBITDAaL margin 
increased by 1.1 percentage points year-on-year (organic: 1.0 
percentage points) at 21.6%.
Customers
We maintained our good commercial momentum, adding 1.4 million 
mobile contract customers during the year, including migrations of 
prepaid customers. We also increased investments to improve our 
networks after the earthquake in the prior year.
Hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey
Turkey was designated as a hyperinflationary economy on 1 April 
2022 in line with IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary 
Economies’. See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated 
financial statements for further information. 
Organic growth metrics exclude the impact of the hyperinflation 
adjustment and foreign exchange translation in Turkey. On an organic 
basis, Group service revenue growth excluding Turkey was 3.7% (Q3: 
3.6%, Q4: 4.0%) and adjusted EBITDAaL excluding Turkey declined by 
0.6%.

On 15 March 2024, we announced that we had entered into a binding 
agreement to sell Vodafone Italy to Swisscom AG for €8 billion 
upfront cash proceeds (subject to customary closing adjustments). 
Completion is expected to take place during the first half of the 2025 
calendar year. The Group recorded a non-cash charge of €83 million, 
included in discontinued operations as a result of the re-
measurement of Vodafone Italy to fair value less costs to sell. See 
note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further 
information.
Total revenue declined 2.9% to €4.7 billion due to lower service 
revenue and equipment revenue. Service revenue declined by 1.6% 
(Q3: -1.3%, Q4: -2.5%), as continued price pressure in the mobile value 
segment was only partly offset by strong Business demand for our 
fixed line connectivity and digital services. Vodafone Business service 
revenue increased by 7.6% (Q3: 7.5%, Q4: 6.1%) during the year, 
driven by strong fixed connectivity and digital services growth.

On 31 October 2023, we announced that we had entered into binding 
agreements with Zegona Communications plc in relation to the sale 
of 100% of Vodafone Spain. We expect final approval from the 
Spanish authorities to be granted imminently, with completion to 
occur shortly thereafter. On completion, we will receive €4.1 billion in 
cash (subject to customary closing adjustments) and €0.9 billion in 
the form of Redeemable Preference Shares, which redeem no later 
than six years after closing. Vodafone and Zegona have entered into 
an agreement whereby Vodafone will provide certain services to 
Vodafone Spain after completion of the transaction and Vodafone will 
continue to have a presence in Spain through its Innovation Hub in 
Malaga. The Group recorded a non-cash charge of €345 million, 
included in discontinued operations as a result of the re-
measurement of Vodafone Spain to fair value less costs to sell. See 
note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further 
information.
Total revenue declined by 1.6% to €3.8 billion due to lower service 
revenue. Service revenue declined by 2.4% (Q3: -1.1%, Q4: -2.9%) due 
to continued price competition in the Consumer value segment, a 
lower customer base and a reduction in mobile termination rates. 
Vodafone Business service revenue declined by 1.2% (Q3: +2.2%, Q4: 
-2.7%) as lower mobile connectivity revenue, due to price competition 
in the SoHo customer segment, was only partially offset by good 
demand for Business digital services, particularly in Q3.

VIL’s results since that date. 
Vantage Towers – 53.9% ownership
On 23 March 2023, we announced the completion of Oak Holdings 
GmbH, our co-control partnership for Vantage Towers with a 
consortium of long-term infrastructure investors led by Global 
Infrastructure Partners and KKR. We received initial net proceeds of 
€4.9 billion in March 2023, and a further €500 million in July 2023, 
taking total net proceeds to €5.4 billion and the Consortium’s 
ownership in Oak Holdings GmbH to 40%. During the year, total 
revenue increased 6.3% to €1.1 billion, driven by 2,400 net new 
tenancies and 1,100 new macro sites. As a result, the tenancy ratio 
increased to 1.50x. Vodafone’s share of results in FY24 reflects the 
amortisation of intangible assets arising from the completion of the 
co-control partnership for Vantage Towers. During the year, Vodafone 
received €196 million in dividends from Vantage Towers.
VodafoneZiggo Joint Venture (Netherlands) – 50.0% ownership
The results of VodafoneZiggo are prepared under US GAAP, which is 
broadly consistent with Vodafone’s IFRS basis of reporting. Total 
revenue increased 1.5% to €4.1 billion, as contractual price increases 
and mobile contract customer growth were partially offset by a 
decline in the fixed customer base. During the year, VodafoneZiggo 
added 129,000 mobile contract customers. VodafoneZiggo’s 
broadband customer base declined by 115,000 customers to 3.2 
million due to the competitive price environment. The number of 
converged households increased by 20,000 and 48% of broadband 
customers are now converged, delivering significant NPS and 
customer loyalty benefits. VodafoneZiggo now offers gigabit speeds 
to 7.5 million homes, providing nationwide coverage. Vodafone’s 
lower share of results in FY24 was largely due to lower adjusted 
EBITDA, lower gains on derivative financial instruments and higher 
third-party interest expenses. During the year, Vodafone received 
€100 million in equity distributions and €51 million in interest 
payments from the joint venture.

Safaricom Associate (Kenya) – 27.8% ownership
Safaricom service revenue declined to €2.1 billion, as the devaluation 
of the local currency was only partially offset by a higher customer 
base and strong mobile data and M-Pesa growth. Vodafone’s lower 
share of results was due to the depreciation of the Kenyan shilling 
versus the euro. During the year, Vodafone received €122 million in 
dividends from Safaricom. 
Indus Towers Limited Associate (India) – 21.0% ownership
Following the sale of shares in Indus Towers Limited (‘Indus Towers’) 
in February and March 2022, the Group holds 567.2 million shares in 
Indus Towers. Vodafone’s higher share of results in FY24 was largely 
due to higher adjusted EBITDAaL. 
Vodafone Idea Limited Joint Venture (India) – 31.4% ownership
See note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ in the 
consolidated financial statements for more information.
Vodafone Idea Limited has undertaken equity fund-raisings totalling

TPG Telecom Limited Joint Venture (Australia) – 25.1% 
ownership
TPG Telecom Limited is a fully integrated telecommunications 
operator in Australia. Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) 
Limited owns an equivalent economic interest of 25.1%, with the 
remaining 49.9% listed as free float on the Australian stock exchange. 
We also hold a 50% share of loan facilities of AU$2.5 billion, US$1.0 
billion and €0.6 billion (2023: US$3.5 billion) held within the structure 
that holds the Group’s equity stake in TPG Telecom. During the year,

Notes:
1. The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented to reflect that the 
results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued operations. 
See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial 
statements for more information.
2. Adjusted net financing costs is a non-GAAP measure. See page 235 for more information. 
Net financing costs increased by €668 million, primarily due to 
year-on-year changes of mark-to-market gains recycled from reserves 
on derivatives that were previously in cash flow hedge relationships 
and mark-to-market movements on the revaluation of the embedded 
derivative option linked to the Group’s bank borrowings secured 
against Indian assets.
Adjusted net financing costs are in line with prior year, reflecting both 
a decrease in average net debt balances and higher returns on cash 
and short-term investments, offset by interest movements on lease 
liabilities and other items outside of net debt.

1. The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented to reflect that the 
results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued operations. 
See note 7 ’Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial 
statements for more information. 
2. Adjusted effective tax rate is a non-GAAP measure. See page 235 for more information.
The Group’s effective tax rate (‘ETR’) for the year ended 31 March 
2024 was 3.1%, (FY23: 3.8%). The rate remains low following the 
recognition of a €1,019 million deferred tax asset on losses in 
Luxembourg as a result of favourable case law during the year. The 
ETR also reflects a tax credit of €249 million (2023: €309 million) 
relating to the impacts of inflation in Turkey.
The year ended 31 March 2023 included gains on the disposals of 
Vantage Towers and Vodafone Ghana which were largely exempt 
from tax, except for a €88 million charge relating to the disposal of 
Vantage Towers, as well as the hyperinflation accounting impacts in 
Turkey and utilisation of losses in Luxembourg.
The Group’s Adjusted ETR (‘AETR’) for the year ended 31 March 2024 
was 24.5% (FY23: 25.6%). The AETR excludes the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset in Luxembourg, the impact of a €598 million tax 
charge (2023: €33 million) relating to the use of losses in 
Luxembourg and the effects of inflation in Turkey.
The charge on losses in Luxembourg is higher than the prior year 
because of an internal restructuring in 2023 which resulted in a loss. 
As a result of that restructuring, profits in Luxembourg are no longer 
subject to changes in the value of investments. The effects of 
hyperinflation accounting in Turkey, and the tax charge relating to the 
disposal of Vantage Towers in 2023, are set out above.
The main drivers for the reduction in the AETR are the mix of profits 
between jurisdictions in 2024 compared to 2023 and Vodafone Spain 
moving to discontinued operations accounting in 2024 as previously 
the non-recognition of tax losses in Spain increased AETR.

Notes:
1. The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented to reflect that the 
results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued operations. 
See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial 
statements for more information. 
2. Adjusted basic earnings per share is a non-GAAP measure. See page 235 for more 
information. 
Basic earnings per share from continuing operations was 4.45 
eurocents, compared to 43.66 eurocents for FY23. The decrease was 
primarily due to gains on disposal in the prior year of Vantage Towers 
A.G. and Vodafone Ghana, partially offset by the loss on the disposal 
of Vodafone Hungary. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share was 7.47 eurocents, compared to 
11.28 eurocents for FY23. The decrease was primarily due to lower 
Adjusted EBITDAaL. 
Consolidated statement of financial position
The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on page 
136. Details on the major movements of both our assets and liabilities 
in the year are set out below.
In accordance with IFRS requirements, Vodafone Spain and Vodafone 
Italy are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated 
financial statements. The assets and liabilities of these discontinued 
operations of €19.0 billion and €6.9 billion, respectively, are classified 
as held for sale and are presented separately as current items in the 
consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2024. This 
results in significant year-on-year movements in reported assets and 
liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. 
See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the 
consolidated financial statements for more information. 
Our financial performance (continued)
Assets 
Non-current assets
Intangible assets decreased by €8.4 billion between 31 March 2023 
and 31 March 2024 to €38.9 billion. This primarily reflects a reduction 
of €6.7 billion from the classification of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone 
Italy as discontinued operations and amortisation exceeding additions 
in the year by €1.2 billion. 
Property, plant and equipment decreased by €9.5 billion between 31 
March 2023 and 31 March 2024 to €28.5 billion. This reflects a 
decrease of €6.5 billion in owned assets and a decrease of €3.0 billion 
in right-of-use assets. These decreases are primarily attributable to 
the classification of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy as 
discontinued operations. 
Investments in associates and joint ventures decreased by €1.0 billion 
between 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2024, primarily attributable to 
a stake sale of 3.9% in Oak Holdings 1 GmbH (Vantage Towers) and 
dividends received in the year exceeding our share of results. 
Deferred tax assets increased by €0.9 billion between 31 March 2023 
and 31 March 2024 to €20.2 billion. See note 6 ‘Taxation’ in the 
consolidated financial statements for more information. 
Trade and other receivables decreased by €1.9 billion between 31 
March 2023 and 31 March 2024 to €6.0 billion, primarily attributable 
to a decrease in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments. 
Current assets
Current assets decreased by €10.1 billion between 31 March 2023 
and 31 March 2024 to €20.5 billion. This was primarily due to a 
decrease in cash and cash equivalents of €5.5 billion, a decrease of 
€2.1 billion in Trade and other receivables, which principally reflects 
the classification of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy as 
discontinued operations, and a decrease of €1.9 billion in Other 
investments. 
Total equity and liabilities 
Total equity decreased by €3.5 billion between 31 March 2023 and 
31 March 2024 to €61.0 billion, primarily due to comprehensive 
expense in the period of €0.7 billion and €2.7 billion of dividends paid 
to the Group’s shareholders. 
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities decreased by €3.3 billion between 31 March 
2023 and 31 March 2024 to €53.2 billion, primarily due to a decrease 
in Borrowings arising from the classification of Vodafone Spain and 
Vodafone Italy as discontinued operations (€2.4 billion). 
Current liabilities
Current liabilities decreased by €11.3 billion between 31 March 2023 
and 31 March 2024 to €23.3 billion, primarily due to a €6.1 billion 
decrease in Borrowings and a €4.8 billion decrease in Trade and 
other payables, of which €2.7 billion reflects the classification of 
Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy as discontinued operations 
and €1.2 billion reflects the sale of M-Pesa Holding Company 
Limited to Safaricom plc. 
Inflation
The Group continues to apply hyperinflationary accounting, as 
specified in IAS 29, at its Turkish operations where the functional 
currency is the Turkish lira and to Safaricom’s operations in Ethiopia 
where the Ethiopian birr is the functional currency. See note 1 ‘Basis 
of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements for more 
information and for a summary of the impact on the financial results 
of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2024.

Cash inflow from operating activities decreased to €16,557 million 
reflecting lower operating profit, excluding a lower share of results in 
equity accounted associates and joint ventures and a net gain in the 
prior year resulting from the sale of Vantage Towers, Vodafone Ghana 
and Vodafone Hungary, and adverse working capital movements, 
which offset lower taxation payments.
Outflows from investing activities increased to €6,122 million, 
primarily in relation to the decrease in proceeds received in the prior 
year from disposal of interests in subsidiaries and a lower net inflow in 
respect of short-term investments, which outweighed proceeds from 
the sale of 3.9% of Oak Holdings 1 GmbH and the decrease in the 
purchase of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in 
the year. Short-term investments include highly liquid government 
and government-backed securities and managed investment funds 
that are in highly rated and liquid money market investments with 
liquidity of up to 90 days.
Outflows from financing activities increased to €15,855 million as 
higher net cash outflows in respect of borrowings, primarily arising 
from movements in collateral balances, outweighed lower outflows in 
relation to the purchase of treasury shares and in respect of 
discontinued operations.

Notes:
1. Gross debt and Net debt are non-GAAP measures. See page 235 for more information.
2. Short-term investments includes €1,201 million (FY23: €1,338 million) of highly liquid 
government and government-backed securities and managed investment funds of €2,024 
million (FY23: €2,967 million) that are in highly rated and liquid money market investments 
with liquidity of up to 90 days.
3. Derivative financial instruments excludes derivative movements in cash flow hedging reserves 
of €498 million gain (FY23: €2,785 million gain). 
4. Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being 
held as security. This is repayable when derivatives are settled and is therefore deducted 
from liquidity.
Net debt decreased by €133 million to €33,242 million. This was 
driven by the free cash inflow of €1,783 million together with other 
movements of €1,065 million, offset by acquisitions and disposals of 
€346 million and equity dividends of €2,430 million.

The Group’s gross and net debt includes certain bonds which have 
been designated in hedge relationships, which are carried at €1,229 
million higher value (€1,282 million higher as at 31 March 2023) than 
their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are 
issued in currencies other than the euro, the Group has entered into 
foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. 
The impact of these swaps is not reflected in gross debt and if it were 
included, the euro equivalent value of the bonds would decrease by 
€1,559 million (€1,440 million as at 31 March 2023). 
Adjusted free cash flow decreased by €1,539 million to €2,600 million 
in the period. This reflects a decrease in Adjusted EBITDAaL in the 
period, adverse working capital movements and lower dividends from 
associates and joint ventures, which outweighed lower capital 
additions, lower taxation, and lower dividends paid to non-controlling 
shareholders in subsidiaries.
Acquisitions and disposals includes €500 million in relation to the 
disposal of 3.9% of Oak Holdings 1 GmbH in the year, offset by a final 
payment of €494 million to settle the Group’s obligations to the 
minority shareholders in Kabel Deutschland Holding A.G.

million (€1,485 million as at 31 March 2023) of bank borrowings that 
are secured against the Group’s shareholdings in Indus Towers and 
Vodafone Idea.
The decrease in borrowings of €9,403 million was principally driven 
by repayment of bonds of €4,847 million, a decrease in collateral 
liabilities of €2,258 million and the transfer of borrowings in Italy and 
Spain to discontinued operations (€3,553 million), offset by the 
issuance of new bonds of €1,314 million.

Return on capital employed
Return on capital employed (‘ROCE’) reflects how efficiently we are 
generating profit with the capital we deploy. We calculate two ROCE 
measures: i) Pre-tax ROCE for controlled operations only and ii) 
Post-tax ROCE including associates and joint ventures. ROCE 
calculated using GAAP measures for the 12 months ended 31 March 
2024 was 3.4% (FY23: 13.0%), impacted by gains on disposal in the 
prior year of Vantage Towers A.G. and Vodafone Ghana, partially offset 
by the loss on the disposal of Vodafone Hungary. 
The table below presents adjusted ROCE metrics.

Notes:
1. The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented to reflect that the 
results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued operations. 
See note 7 ’Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the consolidated financial 
statements for more information. 
2. FY23 ROCE calculations exclude the results of Vantage Towers until its disposal on 22 March 
2023 and the investment in Oak Holdings 1 GmbH from that date. FY23 capital employed for 
calculating post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures), FY22 Capital employed 
for calculating pre-tax ROCE (controlled) and FY22 capital employed for calculating post-tax 
ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) have been adjusted to €57,911 million, 
€56,192 million and €61,515 million, respectively, for the purposes of calculating relevant 
FY23 averages.
3. ROCE is calculated by dividing Operating profit by the average of capital employed as 
reported in the consolidated statement of financial position. Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) and 
Post-tax ROCE (controlled and associates/joint ventures) are non-GAAP measures. See page 
235 for more information. 
Share buybacks
There were no share buybacks during the year ended 31 March 2024. 
On 15 March 2024, the Group announced that the Board has approved 
the capital return through share buybacks of up to €2 billion of 
proceeds from the sale of Vodafone Spain. This is expected to 
commence following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain.
 
This year’s report contains the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 69,

Our purpose
Purpose
Our purpose is to connect for a better future. We aim to 
create a digital society where everyone can thrive. As 
one of the largest European and African telecoms 
companies, we acknowledge our unique position to 
support making the world a better place. 
Vodafone’s connectivity and digital services can transform our 
customers’ lives. Every day, more than 300 million people and 
businesses put their trust in us to connect them to those who matter 
the most. We give people access to the digital tools that can help 
them improve their lives and livelihoods. We support small, medium 
and large businesses to serve their customers and grow. We offer 
access to financial services for people and businesses left out of 
traditional banking systems. 
The opportunities offered by digital technology are numerous. By 
connecting 187 million devices to our advanced networks, cloud and 
Artificial Intelligence services, we are able to help facilitate farmers to 
increase their yields, mayors to create smarter and greener cities, and 
delivery drivers to reduce their fuel consumption. We seek to ensure 
that governments can deliver essential public services digitally, 
improving citizens’ access to education and healthcare. 
The digital society we help to enable aims to make our communities 
more prosperous and more resilient. However, we must seek to 
ensure that as many people as possible are included and that 
progress does not come at the cost of the planet. This is why we place 
Empowering People, Protecting our Planet, and Maintaining Trust at 
the heart of our purpose as a business, guiding everything we do. 
Empowering People
We believe everyone should fully benefit from the digital society, 
regardless of who they are or where they live. However, with a third of 
the world’s population still offline, a digital divide between the 
connected and unconnected persists. We focus on overcoming the 
main barriers to connectivity by increasing network coverage, 
increasing access to smart devices, and providing services aimed 
specifically at bringing more women online. 
We support millions of small businesses, with 3.3 million micro, 
small and medium-sized enterprises (‘MSMEs’) accessing benefits 
of digitalisation through our V-Hub. Our fintech services in Africa 
connect more than 66.2 million people, helping to support 
entrepreneurship, lift communities out of poverty and transform 
national economies. 
We are also there to support people in times of crisis. We provide vital 
emergency connectivity and relief during major disasters. We connect 
refugees to digital education and our emergency material transport 
programme helps provide emergency relief in Africa. 
Protecting our Planet 
Digital technology has an important role to play in enabling the 
climate transition, by helping reduce carbon emissions and 
underpinning climate adaptation technologies. 
However, recognising that technology can create its own impact on 
our climate and nature, we strive to minimise the environmental 
footprint of our operations, value chain and products and services. 
We are working to reduce our environmental impact to reach net zero 
across our full value chain by 2040. We drive energy efficiency in our 
operations and seek to match our energy with electricity from 
renewable sources. 
Digital technology has been recognised as a key enabler of carbon savings. 
We work with our business customers to build solutions to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions (‘GHG’) and lower their planetary impact. 
As use of technology expands, we are playing our role in the growing 
circular economy. We work to minimise the impact of the waste we 
create from our own operations and encourage greater reuse, repair 
and recycling of the hardware our customers use.
Maintaining Trust
Integrity is core to who we are and how we act at Vodafone. 
Recognising that digitalisation can be disruptive and pose new 
challenges, we want to be a trusted partner to customers, employees, 
suppliers and the communities we serve in the digital society. We 
protect their data, ensure that services are delivered securely and 
responsibly, and provide guidance on how to navigate new 
technology. We aim to respect human rights across all our operations, 
and proactively manage risks in our supply chain. 
We continue to foster a diverse and inclusive global workforce that reflects 
the customers and societies we serve. We behave responsibly and 
transparently and always strive to uphold the highest industry standards.

Materiality assessment 
In FY24 we undertook a detailed stakeholder engagement 
exercise to assess our ESG strategy and prioritisation of related 
topics. The assessment provided an analysis of critical enablers 
and identified emerging ESG issues relevant to our business, our 
stakeholders and the societies in which we operate. 
Identification of material issues was determined by extensive 
stakeholder engagement. The views of employees, customers, 
investors, suppliers and peers were gathered via surveys, 
interviews and workshops. The preliminary results of the 
assessment are scheduled for discussion at executive level and 
will be presented to the ESG Committee. 
This stakeholder engagement is a critical step on our journey 
towards completion of our double materiality assessment (‘DMA’) 
as required by the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (‘CSRD’). Once completed, the results of the DMA are 
expected to drive our future strategic focus and non-financial 
reporting as set out in the CSRD. 
UN Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’)
We have identified two primary SDGs where we and our partners 
directly contribute to finding lasting solutions to social, economic 
and environmental challenges and thereby accelerate the delivery 
of many other SDGs.  
SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and 
sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation. 
 
SDG 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and 
revitalise the global partnership for sustainable development.

additional 1,408 sites across these countries, providing 4G coverage 
to an additional 13.8 million people. 
Meanwhile, our partnership with AST & Science LLC seeks to develop 
the first space-based mobile network. This is designed to connect 
directly to consumers’ 4G and 5G devices without the need for 
specialised hardware. This year we successfully made the world’s first 
space-based 5G call using a conventional smartphone. The space-
based network is intended to enable even those in the hardest-to-
reach areas to connect to the internet, ultimately reaching an 
estimated 1.6 billion people across 49 countries. This will include a number 
of LDCs where coverage is currently lowest. 
We are also partnering to increase capacity, quality and availability of 
internet connectivity between Africa and the rest of the world 
through the 2Africa submarine cable partnership. The system will 
deliver more than the total combined capacity of all subsea cables 
serving Africa today, supporting the growth of 4G, 5G and fixed 
broadband access for hundreds of millions of people.
In Europe, we are investing in rural areas, helping small businesses 
overcome barriers to connectivity and digitalisation.

Increasing smartphone ownership
The digital divide goes beyond coverage, and relates to usage 
of networks already deployed.
Globally, 38% of the world’s population (three billion people) are not 
using mobile internet despite living in areas with mobile broadband 
coverage. This usage gap remains almost eight times the size of the 
coverage gap.2 There are many barriers preventing the use of mobile 
broadband, including lack of awareness, low digital skills, and the 
prohibitive upfront cost of smartphones. Given that smartphones are 
increasingly the main gateway to digital services, lowering the cost of 
devices is key to addressing the digital divide. 
Smartphone ownership is lowest in emerging markets. Only 45% of 
adults in emerging markets own a smartphone compared to 76% in 
advanced economies. Women are less likely to own a smartphone 
than men. Affordability is one of the key challenges to smartphone 
adoption. Smartphones can cost more than 70% of average income in 
LDCs, making them unaffordable. 
We recognise that we cannot solve this issue by ourselves, and in 
2022 we co-chaired the ITU/UNESCO Broadband Commission for 
Sustainable Development Working Group on Smartphone Access. The 
working group drew upon the expertise of a cross-sectoral body of 
commissioners and experts. The outcome report, ‘Strategies towards 
universal smartphone access’ identified key interventions to make 
smartphones accessible to all, including: increasing device financing 
options; introducing fair taxation and import duties; and improving 
distribution to remote areas. In addition, the working group 
recommended investigating further the use of device subsidies and 
pre-owned smartphones. We continue to work with partners to 
address the barriers to smartphone ownership; for example, through 
the GSMA Smartphone Access working group. 
We want to spread the benefit of the digital society 
to more people, regardless of who they are or 
where they live. Firstly, through closing the digital 
divide by connecting those who are still 
unconnected. Secondly, by providing digital 
services to help people and small businesses 
prosper. Through Vodafone Foundation we support 
some of the most vulnerable groups in society. 
One third of the planet (2.6 billion) is still offline. In Africa, just 37% of 
people are using the internet, and in the world’s least developed 
countries the figure drops to 35%.1 Although the number of internet 
users in low-income countries is growing, it remains below growth 
requirements to achieve the UN’s target of universal meaningful 
connectivity by 2030. This target is further threatened by high 
inflation and the cost-of-living crisis, which has eroded real incomes 
and pushed millions more into poverty.
The internet is a vital part of everyday life, enabling us to 
communicate, and to access entertainment and vital services such as 
mobile money. Research from the World Bank shows that mobile 
broadband can reduce the number of households in extreme poverty 
by four percentage points. Expanding broadband penetration across 
Africa by 10% could boost GDP per capita by 2.5%.2 
Likewise, we know that MSMEs are less likely to use digital services 
compared to their larger counterparts. More than 1.2 million 
European businesses with fewer than 250 employees are not yet 
digitalised, to compete globally and increase resilience, they need to 
access the digital opportunities of the future. This will provide an 
economic boost to the economies where the MSMEs operate as they 
contribute in excess of €4 trillion to the EU economy annually. 
Our Empowering People strategy focuses on three key areas to 
ensure that everyone benefits from the digital society. Firstly, we want 
to close the digital divide through targeted interventions to bring 
those who are still unconnected online. Secondly, we want to provide 
a range of digital services that help people and small businesses 
prosper online. Finally, through our Vodafone Foundation we support 
some of the most vulnerable groups in society who often fall outside 
our customer base, including refugees and victims of domestic abuse. 
Closing the digital divide 
Increasing broadband coverage
Connecting everyone to digital services, particularly across Africa, is a 
significant challenge. Fixed and mobile services are increasing 
globally, with 4G mobile broadband networks reaching 90% of the 
world’s population, but coverage in sub-Saharan Africa lags behind at 
65%.1
Expanding coverage to rural networks remains a key focus for us, with 
25% of the EU population and 58% of the population in sub-Saharan 
Africa living in rural areas.2 Expansion of rural networks can often be 
more challenging and have a lower return on investment due to lower 
population densities. New approaches, partnerships and a blend of 
technologies across land, sea and space will help us to overcome 
some of these barriers and help deliver universal coverage. 
In order to drive digital inclusion to the hardest-to-connect 
communities, we continue to make good progress on our goal to 
bring 4G to an additional 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa (as 
part of our participation in the UN Partner2Connect digital coalition in 
March 2022). This targeted intervention includes four of the least 
developed countries (‘LDCs’) – Mozambique, Tanzania, Lesotho and 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – and will help to close a 
particular gap in internet usage between urban communities and rural 
communities. During the year we have added 4G technology to an

Supporting communities
Building platforms for financial inclusion
Goal: To connect 75 million people and their families to mobile 
money services by 31 March 2026.
Globally, 1.7 billion adults do not have a bank account, but among them, an 
estimated 1.1 billion have a mobile phone.2 Digital services are key to 
helping people access safe, secure financial services. Without the ability 
to transfer money, people are limited in their ability to save, access 
loans, start a business and even be paid. Together with Safaricom, we 
developed the first mobile money platform, M-Pesa, which provides 
financial services to millions of people who have a mobile phone but 
have limited access to a bank account. Mobile money is also widely 
used to manage business transactions, pay salaries, pensions, 
agricultural subsidies and government grants, and reduces the risks of 
robbery and corruption in cash-based societies. In Egypt, Vodafone Cash 
is a comprehensive e-wallet and financial services platform, catering to the 
needs of the unbanked, two thirds of the Egyptian population. In 
addition, some markets benefit from insurance offerings. Through 
VodaPay, customers in South Africa can access payment products 
and services, including lending and insurance.
In Ethiopia, Safaricom was awarded a licence to provide mobile money 
services in May 2023, launching M-Pesa in the country three months later. 
Over 33 billion transactions amounting to more than €351 million were 
made in the year using M-Pesa, the equivalent of around 4 million per hour 
on average through a network of more than 617,000 agents. M-Pesa is also 
accepted by over one million merchants. As of the end of March 2024, 66.2 
million customers were using Vodafone’s financial inclusion services.

Supporting small businesses to thrive in a digital world 
MSMEs are the lifeblood of many communities, providing 
opportunities for socio-economic participation, as well as social 
mobility for women, young people and ethnic minorities. 
Through Vodafone Business, we provide products and services that 
are specifically tailored for MSME and, small-office home-office, 
(‘SOHO’) businesses, helping guide them through technology choices 
and improving their digital readiness. These segments also represent 
a significant commercial opportunity for Vodafone. We estimate that 
the total addressable market for MSME and SOHO customers in our 
markets3 is €45 billion, and we currently have over five million MSME 
and SOHO customers.
To better support MSMEs across Europe and Africa, Vodafone 
Business offers V-Hub, its digital advice service. This free service 
provides access to online information and connects MSMEs with 
experts who provide one-to-one advice and support on digitally 
transforming businesses in an ever-changing digital world.
In Africa, we continued to expand device-financing options. In South 
Africa, the Easy2Own payment plan now allows customers to 
purchase a smartphone with an upfront deposit and a payment plan 
with monthly, weekly or daily instalments. Airtime or data is allocated 
based on the instalment payment being made. Over 3,700 customers 
have signed up to Easy2Own. Lipa Mdogo Mdogo (Pay Little by Little) 
has been running in Kenya since 2020. The partnership between 
Safaricom, Google and Meta offers a flexible payment plan from as 
little as KSh20 a day. This initiative is also supporting the digitalisation 
of the farming sector, where devices are bundled with DigiFarm, a free 
Safaricom service that offers farm inputs at discounted prices, input 
loans and learning content. Since the launch in 2020, 1.2 million 4G 
devices have been connected through Lipa Mdogo Mdogo. 
Safaricom Kenya, in a joint venture with TeleOne and Jamii Telkom, 
has also established the country’s first smartphone assembly plant to 
kick-start production of locally-assembled smartphones. The factory 
has the capacity to produce up to three million smartphones 
annually, which are expected to be up to 30% cheaper than imported 
smart phones. It is also projected that it will generate between 300 
and 500 direct jobs, foster local talent development and contribute to 
the country’s economic growth. 
Addressing the digital gender gap
The majority of those still unconnected are women. 
The digital gender gap continues to grow in many less developed 
countries, creating a specific need to support digital gender equality. 
In 2023, 70% of men were using the internet globally, compared with 
65% of women. In LDCs just 30% of women used the internet in 2023 
compared to 93% in high-income countries. Research indicates that 
women who have access to mobile internet via a smartphone have 
9% higher levels of wellbeing than women who have access via a 
basic or feature phone. However, across low and middle-income 
countries, women are 17% less likely than men to own a smartphone 
and 19% less likely to use mobile internet.1
Vodafone’s aim is to realise digital gender equity, giving everyone the 
opportunity to benefit from safe, enriching, productive and affordable 
online experiences. Through fair and equitable digital transformation, 
we can support the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals, addressing some of humanity’s greatest challenges. Therefore, 
in order to progress towards digital gender equity, this year we began 
evolving our Connected Women strategy to focus on measuring 
gender equity across our markets in order to monitor progress. 
Focusing on creating relevant services for women is also a key strategy 
to bring more women online. Through connectivity, we seek to support 
positive outcomes for women in education, skills and jobs, health and 
wellbeing, safety and economic empowerment. For example, in many 
African markets, gaining access to quality health information and 
antenatal care can be very difficult. Information delivered by mobile 
can help to bridge the gaps in crucial, basic information. Responding to 
this, our Mum & Baby service continues to grow, giving customers 
free access to maternal, neonatal and child health information in our 
African operations. The service helps parents and caregivers to take 
positive actions to improve their children’s health. In the DRC, the 
initiative Je Suis Cap, (‘I am Capable’), provided 950 women living with 
disabilities, free financial education provided jointly by M-Pesa and 
Visa. Each woman received a starter kit to establish their own business 
as an M-Pesa agent.

Beyond our direct customers, we are working to support MSMEs in 
our supply chain. We offer optional supply chain financing, which 
allows suppliers to leverage Vodafone’s credit position to access 
cheaper funding and liquidity. This has no impact on Vodafone’s 
commercially negotiated payment terms. 
Digitalising key sectors: agriculture and healthcare
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, by 2050, the 
world will need to produce 70% more food than current levels.1 There 
is also a growing need to address the environmental impact of 
agriculture. 
Through Vodacom’s subsidiary Mezzanine, we are helping to digitalise 
agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa through a second generation eVuna 
platform. eVuna is Mezzanine’s smallholding agriculture product 
suite. The product suite includes various software as a service (SaaS) 
offerings, as well as a Marketplace. The eVuna software line offered to 
farmers includes dairy management, seasonal and evouchering. 
In Kenya, using eVuna evouchering, Safaricom supported the Kenyan 
Ministry of Agriculture, Land, and Fisheries (‘MoALF’) with the rollout 
of a government fertiliser subsidy to over 5.9 million smallholder 
farmers in around 40 counties throughout Kenya. These vouchers can 
be used to buy inputs to support maize, rice, and coffee cultivation.
Another solution we have in Kenya is our dairy management software, 
an SMS-based system that digitally records and reconciles litres of 
milk delivered by each farmer to the milk cooperative. The system 
also stores the information on a client-facing dashboard, which 
provides accurate records of each day’s produce by automatically 
adding the amounts reported. Following this, the totals are sent to 
farmers via a daily SMS, in replacement of a manual dairy milk card 
which was used for many years. In FY24, this catered to over 50,0002 
dairy farmers. 
In South Africa, Mezzanine continues to support the Department of 
Agriculture, Land Reform, and Rural Development (‘DALRRD’). This 
programme has issued over 270,000 vouchers3 to smallholder 
farmers, worth a combined value of over ZAR 1.6 billion3.
The global healthcare sector continues to grapple with 
unprecedented transformation and challenges, as the effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic persist. The convergence of an ageing 
population, a shortage of skilled health and social care professionals, 
and a challenging economic climate has continued to disrupt 
healthcare systems worldwide4.
Amidst these challenges, the sector has witnessed significant 
digitalisation efforts, including the expanding role of electronic health 
monitoring solutions and the adoption of artificial intelligence (‘AI’)
and analytics. At the core of these efforts lies the crucial role of robust 
connectivity infrastructures. Technologies like 5G are already making 
a significant impact and provide numerous use cases that simplify the 
work of healthcare professionals. 
In Portugal, we introduced an innovative solution called ‘Hospital@
Home’. This remote patient monitoring solution enables healthcare 
professionals to monitor and clinically evaluate vital patient data, 
including blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose and more. The 
connected solution ensures uninterrupted capture and secure 
transmission of patient data to medical professionals. 
In Germany, we established dedicated 5G networks at Frankfurt 
University Hospital and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein. 
These networks, with their low latency, facilitate diagnostic data 
transmission, enabling clinicians to make timely patient diagnoses.
Supporting vulnerable communities 
Recognising that some of the most vulnerable in society can fall 
outside our customer base and may struggle to access our commercial 
propositions, we continue to provide a suite of targeted services for 
vulnerable groups. During FY24 we continued to grow our Connected 
Education programme, providing access to our ready-made classroom, 
which includes connectivity, devices and collaboration software for 
students and teachers across the world. 
Vodafone Foundation continues to connect refugee and host 
community students to a quality digital education through the Instant 
Network Schools programme, developed and delivered in partnership 
with UNHCR and the UN refugee agency, in the DRC, Egypt, Kenya, 
South Sudan, Tanzania and Mozambique. 
Since 2013, we have worked with the UNHCR on Instant Network 
Schools to transform classrooms into multimedia learning hubs, 
complete with internet connectivity, sustainable solar power, classroom 
kits including tablets, laptops, projectors and speakers, localised digital 
content, and teacher training. In FY24, 32 new Instant Network Schools 
were deployed, taking the total number of schools in operation to 118, 
with over 274,000 students and 4,700 teachers having benefited from 
the programme. By the end of 2025, Vodafone Foundation and UNHCR 
are aiming to reach 500,000 refugee and host-community students and 
10,000 teachers with our Connected Education programme. 
In addition to its work supporting refugees, Vodafone Foundation 
published research in October 2022 that showed 92% of teachers 
surveyed believe that schools have a responsibility to promote digital 
literacy, but only a fifth are competent in the use of digital technologies. 
The Foundation is working to address this through ‘SkillsUpload Jr’, 
which supports young people to thrive in a digital society through 
digital skills training for teachers and students, tools for use in schools 
and access to teaching materials and lesson plans via online platforms. 
Beyond education, the Foundation is using mobile technology with the 
aim of helping to protect people and save lives at scale. Through 
‘m-mama’, our technology is contributing to the reduction of maternal 
mortality, the number one health goal of the SDGs, by increasing access 
to emergency transport. The first region in Tanzania to fully deploy the 
m-mama system saw a 38% reduction of maternal mortality5. The 
programme, which is also preparing to launch in Kenya in 2024, 
provides a national, 24/7 emergency transport system for women and 
newborns in need, by coordinating ambulances and volunteer car 
owners from a woman’s village or local health facility, to transport them 
to higher level medical care. 
At the same time the Foundation has also supported 2.6 million people 
affected by abuse and hate crime by connecting them to information, 
advice and support through a suite of apps. The Bright Sky platform is 
accessible across four continents, to anyone who is concerned about 
domestic abuse. In addition, the UK app, Zoteria promotes the safety 
and wellbeing of the LGBTQ+ community.

Purpose (continued)
Protecting the Planet
We provide connectivity and digital solutions that help to 
enable the climate transition and aim to empower others 
to reduce GHG emissions, protect nature and improve 
the efficiency of resource usage. We are working to 
minimise the environmental footprint of our operations, 
our value chain and our products and services – by 
reaching net zero and improving the circularity of the 
technology we use and sell. This year, we continued to 
embed our Planet strategy across our business.
Our Protecting the Planet strategy centres around three key areas: 
net zero, enablement and circularity. During the year, we reviewed 
our near and long-term Planet goals against our business plans, 
opportunities and external constraints, which led to the refresh of 
some of our goals at the end of this financial year.
Our Planet goals 
2025
 – Match 100% of the grid electricity we use globally with 
electricity added to the grid from renewable sources1,2
 – Reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste
2028
 – Net zero GHG emissions from our operations  
(Scope 1 and 2) in Europe3,4,5
2030
 – Reduce GHG emissions from our operations  
(Scope 1 and 2) by at least 90%2,4,5
 – Halve GHG emissions from our value chain (Scope 3)2,4
 – Enable 350 million tonnes of carbon emissions to be 
avoided through green digital solutions6
2035
 – Net zero GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) in 
Africa3,4,5
2040
 – Net zero GHG emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3)4,7
Notes:
1. Our renewable electricity purchasing is partly enabled through the procurement of 
renewable electricity certificates, which certify that electricity has been added to the grid 
from renewable generation sources (‘RECs’), such as wind, solar and hydropower. 
2. These goals are part of our SBTi-validated near-term target, which was re-validated this year. The 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions target was revised as part of the revalidation process to align with 
the SBTi Corporate Net Zero Standard, which targets a minimum 90% emissions reduction. This 
target was previously presented as a 90-95% emissions reduction in our FY23 Annual Report. 
3. During the year, we introduced these goals to reflect the two pathways we have set towards 
net zero operations (Scope 1 and 2) – specific to the regions where we operate (Europe and 
Africa). These regional net zero goals replace our previous goal (net zero emissions from our 
operations (Scope 1 and 2) globally by 2030) to support transition planning within each 
regional context (see our Climate Transition Plan for more detail of our transition pathway). 
These goals include a minimum 90% emissions reduction, with any remaining emissions 
neutralised through carbon offsetting from the net zero target year. 
4. Against a baseline of financial year ended 31 March 2020 from our continuing operations.
5. Our Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions are those that come directly from continuing operations under 
our operational control and indirectly from the energy we purchase and use in those operations. 
6. Cumulatively from 2020 to 2030, based on carbon emissions avoided by our business 
customers through the use of digital solutions (products and services) that we sell.
7. This goal is part of our SBTi-validated long-term net zero target, which was approved this year. This 
includes at least 90% absolute reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions.

Climate Transition Plan
We are proud to publish Vodafone’s first Climate Transition Plan in 
2024, which outlines the actions we plan for FY25 to FY27 to reduce 
GHG emissions in line with our net zero pathway and build resilience 
into our business in response to our changing climate. Our Climate 
Transition Plan signifies a step-change in how we have embedded 
decarbonisation into our business and financial planning process. 
Climate transition planning has enabled us to look at our business 
plans with greater granularity and develop emission reduction 
pathways appropriate to each region, whilst retaining our 
commitment to our SBTi-validated climate targets.

Our Climate Transition Plan includes actions to build the climate 
resilience of our business model in response to the physical impact of 
climate change and changes driven by the transition to a lower-
carbon economy. Once again this year, we reviewed our exposure to 
climate-related risks and opportunities as part of a scenario analysis.

Goals: To reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (‘GHG’) from our own 
operations (Scope 1 and 2) to net zero in Europe by no later than 
2028 and in Africa by no later than 2035, and across our full value 
chain (Scope 3) by 2040. 
We recognise the need to address the global climate crisis. In 2023, 
public awareness of the climate impact of technology continued to 
grow. Creating a more digital society is core to our purpose at 
Vodafone. This inevitably comes with increasing volumes of internet 
use and mobile data traffic, which have historically correlated to 
increased GHG emissions. We continue to work to drive down our 
emissions in absolute terms as well as shifting our energy mix to 
renewable sources, in line with what is required by science to avoid 
the most negative impacts of climate change.
In FY24, our long-term climate goal – to achieve net zero GHG 
emissions across our full value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2040 – was 
validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This reinforces 
our commitment to science-based emission reductions from our own 
operations, our supply chain and the products and services we sell. 
Read more about our climate-related risk and opportunities  
in our TCFD-aligned disclosure on pages 64 to 69 
Our FY24 performance: Our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) 
GHG emissions decreased by 24% to 0.69 million tCO2e (tonnes of 
carbon dioxide equivalent). This equates to a 59% reduction from our 
2020 baseline. Our Scope 3 GHG emissions decreased 12% to 6.07 
million tCO2e, representing a 20% increase from our 2020 baseline. 
We were proud to be A-rated by CDP for climate change again in 
December 2023.
Net zero operations (Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions)
Over the year, we continued to reduce GHG emissions from our 
operations and the energy we purchase and use in those operations 
(Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions), with a focus on driving energy 
efficiency across our mobile and fixed-line networks, phasing out the 
use of fossil fuels and increasing renewable sources of energy for 
both our stationary equipment and vehicle fleet. 
Driving energy efficiency
Improving energy efficiency continued to be a strategic priority for 
Vodafone, to control both energy costs and GHG emissions. Energy 
use by our mobile access network, fixed-line network and technology 
centres accounted for 93% of our total global energy consumption. 
Energy efficiencies were achieved through a wide range of initiatives 
including modernisation of legacy equipment with new generation 
and highly efficient network equipment, new software functionality 
that reduces energy consumption in low-load conditions, improving 
energy efficiency in our data centres, digital solutions for energy 
optimisation, and rationalisation of our properties. We invested €31 
million of capital expenditure in energy efficiency and on-site 
renewable projects, which led to annual savings of 11 GWh.
In FY24, Vodafone launched a global tender for new network 
equipment for our radio access network (‘RAN’). The scope of the 
tender includes approximately 170,000 of our mobile access base 
stations. It aims to further improve network energy efficiency through 
deployment of the latest generation of network equipment products, 
such as more efficient power amplifiers, new network technology 
architectures such as ´OpenRAN´ and smart power-saving features.

We continued to implement the ISO 50001 Energy Management 
Standard globally across our operations. Certification was achieved by 
an additional five of our operating companies, bringing the total number 
of ISO 50001 certified markets to 16. Digitalisation of the energy system, 
data and analytics are key enablers for optimising energy consumption 
across our operations. Our energy data management and digital 
artificial intelligence and machine learning (‘AI-ML’) based analytics 
system, which collects and stores data from our electricity suppliers 
and from smart meters, is now live across 10 markets in Europe and 
one market in Africa, with smart meters installed at over 40,000 sites.

Switching to renewables 
The majority of the energy we use in our operations comes from purchased 
grid electricity. Our network also uses electricity generated by stationary 
generators, which are mostly powered by fossil fuels (diesel or petrol). 
Our fleet of vehicles is fuelled by a mix of diesel, petrol and, increasingly, 
purchased electricity. This year, we continued our efforts to phase out 
fossil fuels from our operations in favour of renewable energy sources.
Purchasing renewable electricity
Our goal is to match 100% of the grid electricity we use globally with 
electricity added to the grid from renewable sources by 2025. This 
year, 100% of the grid electricity used in our European network (FY23: 
100%), and 84% globally, (FY23: 75%), was matched with electricity 
from renewable sources. While maintaining our renewable electricity 
purchasing in Europe, our main focus this year has been on creating 
new models for renewable electricity purchasing in Africa, where 
renewable electricity markets are significantly less mature. 
In South Africa, we signed a first-of-its-kind ‘virtual wheeling’ agreement 
with the national power producer – Eskom – which allows Vodacom 
to secure renewable electricity from independent power producers 
(‘IPPs’) that are connected to the national grid. The first phase is 
underway and will see IPPs providing approximately 30% of Vodacom 
South Africa’s power demand. Previously, this was not possible for a 
company of the size and complexity of Vodacom, which has over 
15,000 low-voltage mobile sites in 168 municipalities. This innovation 
was co-developed by Mezzanine (a Vodacom subsidiary) and Eskom. 
We are optimistic this project can make a positive difference to the 
energy transition in South Africa, where regular planned power cuts 
are implemented as Eskom seeks to prevent national blackouts 
resulting from demand exceeding generation capacity. This virtual 
wheeling model enables broader private sector participation, which 
can help accelerate efforts to solve the country’s energy crisis. 
In Egypt, we implemented an agreement, signed at COP27 in 
November 2022, with the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity and Energy 
to purchase renewable electricity from the New and Renewable 
Energy Authority (‘NREA’). The agreement is the first of its kind in 
Egypt, where a national system of renewable electricity certificates is 
not yet established. As part of this agreement, the Egyptian Ministry of 
Electricity and Energy will match the electricity used by Vodafone 
Egypt’s mobile network with electricity added to the grid from 
renewable sources over a one-year period, renewed annually. This 
supports the investment case for growing the Egyptian renewable 
energy sector and the development of a market mechanism to sell 
and purchase renewable electricity and offers a reference for other 
corporate renewable electricity buyers to follow.
In Europe, we continued to increase the proportion of electricity we 
source directly from renewable generators through power purchase 
agreements (‘PPAs’). We signed additional renewable supply in FY24 
representing an increase in our long term contracted PPA volumes by 
over 20%. We now have PPAs established in Germany, Greece, 
Portugal and the UK. Those currently in operation delivered around 
24% of the grid electricity we used in Europe1. From 2026 our PPAs 
will be fully operational and they will generate approximately 39% of 
our grid electricity demand in Europe1. PPAs provide us with more 
price certainty against current volatile wholesale electricity prices. 
The remainder of our electricity consumption is matched with 
renewable energy certificates (‘RECs’) that we purchase through our 
energy suppliers or from the REC market.

Purpose (continued)
On-site renewable generation
We also continued to install and deploy new solar photovoltaic (‘PV’) 
systems at sites in Germany, the UK, Turkey, Egypt and Albania. This 
increased our annual on-site generation of renewable electricity to 21 
GWh per annum.
We are seeking to expand our current implementation of micro-grids in 
the DRC, as well as collaborating with partners to develop new innovative 
solutions for renewable energy generation. For example, in Egypt we 
have trialled a site powered solely from on-site solar and wind generation. 
To get the most benefit from our on-site renewables, we have carried 
out investigations into battery technology and have currently 
identified sodium-ion batteries as the most promising technology for 
energy storage. We have tested prototypes from a supplier with 
positive results and are looking to carry out similar tests with 
additional suppliers.
Reducing diesel and petrol use for generators
We used 76.3 million litres of diesel in FY24 (a 5.6% increase from 
FY23: 72.3 million litres) to fuel generators at sites that are off-grid or 
have unreliable grid electricity supply. Use of fuels in generators 
contributed 79% to our Scope 1 GHG emissions (FY23: 78%). 
Reducing diesel use continues to be particularly challenging in 
markets with unreliable grids (where electricity supply from the 
national grid is routinely interrupted due to insufficient generation), 
such as the DRC, South Africa and Egypt. This year we conducted 
further research into alternatives to diesel, including the feasibility 
and environmental credibility of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a 
bio-based fuel, with a view to establishing some proof-of-concept trials 
over the coming year. 
We are also testing hydrogen fuel cell technology in South Africa. The 
technology comprises a fuel cell, an electrolyser and low-pressure 
hydrogen storage whereby hydrogen is generated from water that is 
recycled through a closed circuit. The technology can generate 
hydrogen when renewable electricity is available – from the grid or 
small scale on-site renewable power generation – which can be used 
to power our mobile base stations when renewable electricity is not 
available. We also continue to connect off-grid sites to the grid where 
possible to minimise the use of generators. 
Electrification of our fleet
We continued to increase the number of electric vehicles (EVs) in our 
company fleet (with EVs making up 58% of the fleet compared to 51% 
in FY23). We continue to improve the total cost of ownership for EVs and 
deliver cost savings that can be reinvested into fleet electrification and 
EV-charging infrastructure. This year, we introduced EV training and 
organised EV test drives to raise drivers’ awareness. In November 2023, we 
won Fleet Europe’s award for European Green Fleet Manager of the Year.
Net zero value chain (Scope 3 emissions)
We aim to halve the emissions from our full value chain by 2030 and 
bring them to net zero by 2040 (against a 2020 baseline). This 
includes our indirect (Scope 3) emissions, which we estimate to be 
6.07 million tCO2e in FY24, 12% lower than the previous year), 
forming 90% of our total GHG emissions.
We continued to strengthen the methodologies and underlying 
assumptions used for calculating our Scope 3 emissions data. In line 
with GHG Protocol standards, we recalculated our base year and 
previous years’ Scope 3 emissions to account for recent organisational 
changes, including the FY23 divestment of our operating companies in 
Ghana and Hungary, and our tower company, Vantage Towers. 
We also improved the accuracy of factors used in the spend-based 
calculation of the embodied emissions of the goods and services we 
procure. Using a spend-based methodology for calculating the 
emissions from parts of our upstream supply chain means that 
economic trends (such as foreign exchange rate fluctuations and 
inflation) can also affect the modelling of our Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
Our Scope 3 GHG emissions decreased by 12% compared to the 
previous year. Since 2020, Scope 3 emissions have increased by 20%. 
Currently, one of the key drivers of year-to-year trends in our Scope 3 
emissions is improvements in the quality of data inputs, emission 
factors or calculation methods. This year, we were pleased that more 
of the companies in which we hold an equity stake have shared their 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG inventory with us, indicating an increase in the 
maturity of GHG measurement. In particular, this year we observed a 
decrease in energy consumption by Vodafone Idea (India). Combined 
with a decrease in the carbon intensity of India’s electricity grid, this 
has driven a decrease in the emissions we finance through our 
investments (Scope 3 Category 15), which has resulted in a significant 
decrease in the Scope 3 GHG emissions from our investments. This 
year we have also observed a decrease in lifecycle emissions 
associated with devices that we purchase and sell to customers.
The continued evolution of Scope 3 data sources and methodologies 
creates a significant challenge. Likewise, the low availability of 
product carbon footprint data remains a constraint on the calculation 
of accurate Scope 3 GHG emissions across the market. Improvements in 
data quality and availability will help us continue to move away from 
estimating using a spend-based methodology, towards methodologies 
that use more specific product carbon footprint data provided by our 
suppliers. We therefore continue to invest in improving our Scope 3 
data models as better data sources become more accessible and 
available. We have also continued to collaborate with our industry 
peers through forums such as the Joint Alliance for CSR (‘JAC’) and 
GSMA to improve access to high quality carbon data from our common 
supply chain. Over time, these efforts aim to improve measurement 
and reduction of Scope 3 GHG emissions across our industry. 
To drive Scope 3 GHG emission reductions in FY24, we continued to 
engage with our suppliers on climate action through our procurement 
process, which includes a 20% weighting on ESG criteria (including 
5% weighting on climate-related performance) during supplier 
selection. Vodafone is a member of JAC, a telecommunications 
industry organisation that promotes a consistent and simplified 
approach to engaging suppliers and supporting the transition of our 
industry towards net zero. Following its launch, our banking partners 
also continue to roll out an environmental supply chain finance 
programme, which offers financial incentives for our suppliers to 
disclose carbon data to CDP and take action to improve their 
environmental performance over time. We also progressed activities 
to improve the circularity of devices we sell, which helps reduce our 
Scope 3 GHG emissions and reduces e-waste.
Although we are pleased that our Scope 3 emissions have decreased 
compared to the previous year, we recognise that they are 20% 
higher than our 2020 base year. This has primarily been driven by 
increases in our estimated emissions from two parts of our value 
chain: upstream supply chain (from purchased goods and services, 
and capital goods); and investments. In both cases, the accuracy and 
completeness of the underlying data used to calculate the emissions 
has improved since 2020. In relation to our upstream supply chain, 
the increase in emissions also correlates to an increase in 
procurement spend.
The 20% increase in our Scope 3 GHG emissions compared to 2020 
means we are not yet on track to achieve our goal of halving Scope 3 
emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero across our full value chain 
by 2040. This year, we published our Climate Transition Plan, which 
outlines actions we plan to take to further drive Scope 3 emissions

reductions – including increasing supplier engagement, building a 
more circular economy for electronic devices, and engaging companies 
we invest in to support their transition to net zero. We will implement 
these planned actions in parallel with continued improvement of our 
Scope 3 data modelling to better reflect our emission reduction efforts. 
Enablement
Goal: To enable our business customers to reduce their own GHG 
emissions by 350 million tonnes between 2020 and 2030 through the use 
of our green digital solutions.1 
Research suggests that 84% of existing Internet of Things (‘IoT’) 
deployments have the potential to also address the UN Sustainable 
Development Goals (‘SDGs’)2. With increasing adoption rates of IoT, 
one of our most important contributions to protecting our planet is 
enabling our customers, including consumers, businesses and 
governments, to reduce their environmental footprint using our 
digital technologies and services. We continued this journey with a 
focus on using digital solutions to tackle climate change and help 
decarbonise society.
Our FY24 performance: This year, we estimate we have enabled the 
avoidance of 32.8 million tCO2e, which is around 75 times the 
emissions generated from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2 in 
FY24). Since setting our enablement target in 2020, we estimate we 
have enabled our customers to avoid a cumulative 78.3 million tCO2e.
This year, we reviewed the emissions reduction impact of an additional 
four green digital solutions within our product portfolio, including 
connectivity solutions that use software defined local area networks 
(‘SD LAN’). IoT products remain the most significant contributor to 
enablement. We estimate that 55% of our 187 million IoT connections 
directly enabled customers to reduce their emissions in the past year. 
For example, we continue to support customers to improve operational 
efficiency, reduce fuel costs and reduce their emissions through our 
Vodafone Business Fleet Analytics solution, which helps our customers 
to optimise routes and identify opportunities to electrify their fleet.

As part of our continued efforts to raise awareness of the role of digital 
technology in the green transition, we hosted a summit for our Vodafone 
Business customers in London in January 2024, on the theme of 
‘Innovation for Impact’. The summit was attended by over 100 Vodafone 
Business customers and visitors and included a range of talks and events 
to help them think about our collective role in the green digital transition. 
Vodafone is a founding member of the European Green Digital Coalition 
(‘EGDC’). Since its establishment in 2021, we have actively participated 
in the development of an ICT sector methodology for measuring the 
carbon enablement impact, known as the ‘net carbon impact’, of green 
digital solutions, leveraging the lessons learned from our own 
experience of carbon enablement reporting over the past four years. 
Circularity 
Goals: To reuse, resell or recycle 100% of our network waste by 2025; to 
collect 1 million used mobile phone devices for reuse, recycling or donation. 
The UN estimates that as much as 50 million tonnes of electronic and 
electrical waste (e-waste) is produced globally each year, with only 
20% being formally recycled. As the use of technology expands and 
develops, we are playing our part to address the growing global 
e-waste problem. Our circular economy (‘circularity’) initiatives look at 
two main types of e-waste; network equipment, such as radio 
equipment used to run our fixed and mobile access networks and the 
electronic devices that we sell to customers such as smartphones.
Our FY24 performance: We reused, resold or recycled 96% of network 
waste in FY24 (FY23: 95%). In partnership with WWF, we have collected 
337,680 used phones for refurbishment and reuse, recycling or donation, 
which is 34% towards our ‘1 million Phones for the Planet’ goal. 
Network waste
We implement resource efficiency and waste disposal management 
programmes in all our markets to minimise environmental impacts 
from network waste and IT equipment waste. This year, we generated 
an estimated 6,205 tonnes of network waste equipment (including 
hazardous waste) (FY23: 7,716). We reused, resold and recycled 96% 
of the non-hazardous waste, partly via our asset marketplace, which 
was established in 2020 to resell and repurpose excess or 
decommissioned network equipment (thus extending its life cycle) by 
enabling trading between our operating companies and across the 
telecommunications industry. This year, we estimate that we have 
saved €3.9 million of spend and avoided over 398 tCO2e through our 
asset marketplace platform. This is in addition to our strategy to reuse 
equipment within individual operating companies. For example, 
Vodafone UK avoided an estimated 1,045 tonnes of CO2e in FY24 by 
reusing network equipment.

Devices 
We are exploring a range of ways to help build a more circular economy 
for home and mobile devices, including collection of used devices, 
supporting refurbishment and reuse, increasing recycling of end-of-life 
devices, and improving the market availability of more sustainable devices.
Collection 
Over the year, we continued with campaigns, initiatives and the 
provision of services to support our customers to keep electronic 
devices in use for longer – through repair, refurbishment and reuse. 
When devices reach the end of their useful life, our aim is for them to 
be responsibly recycled instead of being sent to landfill.

Purpose (continued)
This year, we introduced a target to collect 1 million used mobile phone 
devices for reuse, recycling or donation. This new target relates to our 
campaign to collect ‘1 million Phones for the Planet’, which was 
launched in November 2022 in partnership with WWF. Since the start 
of the campaign, we have collected an estimated 337,680 used phones 
for refurbishment and reuse, recycling or donation to social causes. 
Increasing the rate of collection of used devices is an essential step in 
building a more circular economy for mobile phones and preventing 
them from ending up in landfill. Partnering with WWF on this 
campaign has enabled Vodafone to raise the profile of the 
environmental importance of bringing back e-waste. Since launching 
the campaign, we have worked together with WWF on campaign 
communications and promotional materials that build consumer 
understanding and raise awareness of the issue of e-waste.

Reuse
Our ‘trade in’ service encourages consumers to extend the lifetime of 
their device by trading it in to be refurbished and resold. Our Group 
trade-in programme is now live in three European markets through a 
digital trade-in platform or via retail, offering customers a guaranteed 
price to make the trade-in customer journey convenient, cost effective and 
attractive. This year we increased the reach of our digital trade-in proposition 
by expanding our digital platform to Portugal and Germany. Together 
with our partner, Recommerce, we also launched our digital diagnostics 
solution in the Czech Republic, with other markets to follow in 2024.
We are helping to build a more circular economy through our 
products and services for business customers too. For example, our 
Vodafone Business Device Lifecycle Management solution offers 
companies a managed device-as-a-service solution with reuse and 
recycling at end of life, helping our business customers to reduce the 
environmental impact of mobile devices used by their workforces. 
Recycling 
We continued our ‘One for One’ campaign in Germany, in partnership 
with Closing the Loop. This e-waste reduction initiative promises that 
for every phone purchased directly from Vodafone by consumers in 
Germany, one ’end-of-life’ phone will be collected and recycled. 
Closing the Loop is a waste collector that solely works in countries 
where e-waste is normally not properly collected and recycled. This 
campaign diverts e-waste from landfill or improper recycling while 
also enabling precious metals to be safely recovered from hazardous 
waste. As at January 2024, our One for One campaign has enabled 
the collection of over 1.1 million scrap mobile devices in Ghana, 
equating to over 63,000 kilograms of e-waste, from which about 
5,000 kilograms of precious metals (gold, silver and copper) will be 
recovered. At least 3,000 monthly living wages have been created 
since the start of the collaboration, thus supporting the livelihoods of 
people in local communities and providing opportunities for them to gain 
income and develop new skills.
Improving device sustainability 
Vodafone is a co-founder of Eco Rating, a pan-industry eco-labelling 
consortium for newly manufactured smartphones. It seeks to help 
consumers identify and compare the sustainability of mobile phones, 
enabling them to make more sustainable product choices. Through our 
work as part of the consortium, we engaged with mobile device 
manufacturers to encourage improvements in their Eco Rating score, 
by improving overall environmental impact, including device circularity 
and reducing GHG emissions – both of which also help to reduce the 
Scope 3 GHG emissions from Vodafone’s upstream supply chain. 
Eco Rating is now operational in 39 countries, supported by 22 
manufacturers and a total of nine operators. Since its introduction, the 
rating has contributed to improving the environmental performance 
of mobile phones on the market, illustrated by the increase of the 
average Eco Rating score from 74 to 77 out of a maximum 100 
since it was launched in 2021. Vodafone now operates this initiative 
in nine markets, with over 275 handsets assessed and available to 
our customers.

We also encourage our customers to consider purchasing ‘second-
life’ refurbished devices. Purchasing a refurbished smartphone saves 
around 50 kilograms of CO2e, making its contribution to climate change 
87% lower than that of the equivalent, newly manufactured smartphone, 
and removes the need to extract 77 kilograms of raw materials.1
We offer customers high quality and competitively priced refurbished 
smartphone ranges in UK, Turkey, and Vodacom South Africa.
We also design a number of home products including broadband 
routers and TV set-top boxes. We have begun integrating sustainability 
principles into the design process for our products and packaging. For 
example, our new Vodafone Hub family of broadband routers was 
designed using 95% post-consumer recycled resin, a mechanical 
design to enable simpler refurbishment, energy optimisation features 
and zero plastic packaging. This year, in recognition of the sustainable 
features of its product design (including use of recycled materials, 
durability, repairability and energy efficiency), we also obtained TÜV 
Green Seal certification for our first Vodafone branded product, a 
television set-top box. 
Nature 
The world is currently undergoing a dangerous decline in nature with 
one million species threatened with extinction, impacting the lives of 
billions of people and economies. In December 2022, 188 
governments adopted the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework 
consisting of four overarching goals to reverse the loss of nature by 
2050. We recognise the need for a sustainable approach to nature 
and in FY24 initiated a review of the biodiversity impacts, risks and 
dependencies of our business operations, products and services. 
Digital technology can be applied to enable interventions and actions 
to protect, manage and restore nature. The so-called nature 
technology market is expected to be worth $6 billion within 10 years.2 
Our review highlighted the variety of nature technology solutions 
Vodafone is already building across a number of ecosystems. Several 
of our operating companies are taking action on biodiversity through 
a range of initiatives appropriate for their local contexts. For example, 
in South Africa, Vodacom has created an AI-based technology 
solution to use cameras and hydrophones to identify and alert mussel 
farmers to the presence of marine mammals including whales in 
order to prevent entanglement in mussel farming ropes.
In Romania, the IoT team has created a system based on acoustic 
sensors deployed in forest areas. The sensors pick up forest sounds 
and the AI can identify the specific sound of logging and trigger the 
sending of real time alerts with geolocation to forest administrators 
and directly to rangers’ phones so they can intervene immediately. 
This year, Vodafone Group has also successfully completed proof of 
concept for mTwiga, our digital technology solution for preventing 
human-wildlife conflict, which was developed by the winners of 
Vodafone’s in-house innovation accelerator programme, Launchpad, 
in 2022. mTwiga uses cameras with advanced video analytics and 
AI-enabled software to recognise predator species (such as leopard, 
hyena and lion) within close proximity to human settlements. mTwiga 
is able to send real-time alerts to communities and rangers and is 
designed to operate off-grid. Our field trials in Kenya in March 2024 
identified a number of opportunities around bespoke AI models and 
species deterrents that we hope to build on during 2024.

We contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals 
The UN Sustainable Development Goals (‘SDGs’) 
provide a blueprint for human progress and a clear call 
to action for businesses to contribute to a better future. 
The climate crisis, war and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic and other global crises have meant that the world is facing 
a reversal of progress on many of the SDGs. At their mid-point, around 
half are off-track and over 30% have regressed or stalled. Under 
current trends, the UN estimates that 575 million people will be living 
in extreme poverty by 2030 and 84 million children will be out of 
school. Meanwhile, the world is at hunger levels not seen since 2005, 
the window to limit the rise in global temperatures is closing quickly, 
and it will take an estimated 286 years to close the gender gap.1
Digital technology will be essential in reducing these impacts and 
helping progress towards delivering the SDGs. We are working to play 
our part and believe we can increase the speed and scale of delivery 
across a wide number of SDGs through leveraging our technology and 
services, and through partnering with others. Simultaneously, we can 
drive significant growth. For example, our M-Pesa and other mobile money 
plaforms, designed to enable financial inclusion, has 66.2 million active 
customers generating revenue this year of €351 million.

We enable inclusive and sustainable digital societies
At Vodafone, we are accelerating connectivity and digitalisation in 
order to achieve the SDGs by 2030. We have identified two priority 
SDGs (SDG 9 Build Resilient Infrastructure, promote sustainable 
industrialisation and foster innovation, and SDG 17 revitalise the 
global partnership for sustainable development) that will enable 
us and our partners to find lasting solutions to social, economic 
and environmental challenges and thereby accelerate the delivery 
of other SDGs.
The SDGs will only be achieved through partnerships, and we 
continue to pioneer new models of co-operation between 
business, governments, international organisations and civil 
society to deliver progress and scale. For example, we were a 
founding member of the International Telecommunication Union’s 
Partner2Connect coalition to connect the unconnected. 
In FY24, our partnership in Ethiopia with Safaricom PLC, Vodacom, 
Sumitomo Corporation and British International Investment 
received a major boost with news that the World Bank Group, one 
of the world’s major development finance institutions has invested 
in the business. Together with its partners, Safaricom Ethiopia has 
committed to help meet Ethiopia’s SDGs and improve the 
agriculture, medical, education, financial and tourism sectors of 
the country by rolling out, launching and operating 4G and 5G 
mobile networks across the entire country – including in rural and 
urban areas.
We continue to develop our partnerships to address environmental 
challenges. For example, our major global partnership with WWF 
will support our goals to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 
2040 and encourage a more circular economy for mobile phones.

Other information

As an integral part of our purpose, we need to ensure 
that we are maintaining trust in everything that we do. 
This section of the Strategic Report covers the elements 
underpinning our responsible business strategy. On this page, we 
explain how we embed an understanding of our Code of Conduct 
throughout the Group and provide our people and suppliers with 
access to a whistleblowing hotline (‘Speak Up’). This section also 
summarises our approach to protecting data and people, as well as 
how we ensure we behave ethically, lawfully and with integrity 
wherever we operate.
Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct sets out what we expect from every single 
person working for Vodafone, regardless of location. We also expect 
our suppliers and business partners to uphold the same standards as 
set out in our Code of Ethical Purchasing.
Click to read our Code of Conduct: 
vodafone.com/code-of-conduct
Our Doing What’s Right (‘DWR’) training and communication 
programme is key to embedding a shared understanding of the Code 
of Conduct across Vodafone. Throughout the year, the DWR 
communication programme promoted different areas of our Code of 
Conduct, including Speak Up, anti-bribery, privacy, competition law, 
security, and health and safety. This year, we shared a message 
reminding everyone about our responsibility to act ethically through a 
special message featuring our leadership members.
Training on our Code of Conduct is included in our standard induction 
process for new employees. We expect every employee to complete 
refresher training when assigned, and this is typically every two years. 
Of those employees assigned induction or refresher DWR training during 
the period, 93.6% had completed the training as of 31 March 20241. 
To keep the knowledge of our Code of Conduct fresh, we launched 
assessment tests this year across areas like the Code of Conduct, 
anti-bribery, health and safety, privacy and security within selected 
markets. The newly launched refreshers have helped us test and 
refresh knowledge of key concepts. These tests have received a high 
Net Promoter Score of 86-93%. Those who did not pass are required 
to complete learning in the relevant subject area. These assessment 
tests will also be launched across other markets in FY25. 
This year our competition law learning module was also upgraded. 
This course was assigned to select learners who are closest to competition 
law risks. It had a completion rate of 88% as of 31 March 20241. 
We also strive to make compliance easy for our employees and 
continue to improve our digital Code of Conduct and global policy 
portal, the internal platform where employees can find information 
about our policies and procedures. A programme is underway to 
streamline our policy environment and optimise the number of 
policies so that we can effectively address our risk environment. 
Our digital Code of Conduct and policy sites continue to be accessed 
widely by users across the Group with over 200,000 visits to the policy 
portal in the last quarter of FY241. 
Our Code of Conduct is well understood throughout Vodafone. In the 
April 24 Spirit Beat employee survey, 95% of respondents agreed with 
the statement ‘Our team lives by the Code of Conduct’.
 
Speak Up
Everyone who works for or on behalf of Vodafone has a responsibility 
to report any behaviour at work that may be unlawful or criminal, or 
could amount to an abuse of our policies, systems or processes and, 
therefore, be a breach of our Code of Conduct. Employees are able to 
raise concerns with a line manager, with a colleague from human 
resources or through our anonymous confidential third-party hotline, 
Speak Up, which is accessible in local languages online or by telephone.
We have a non-retaliation policy when a genuine concern has been 
reported. Everyone who raises a concern in good faith is treated fairly, 
with no negative consequences for their employment with Vodafone, 
regardless of the outcome of any subsequent investigation.
Speak Up reports are confidentially investigated by local specialist 
teams, with a senior team in place to triage reports. Each grievance is 
monitored to verify that any corrective action plan or remediation has 
been conducted. Our Group Risk and Compliance Committee reviews 
the effectiveness of the Speak Up process and trends once a year, 
and the Audit and Risk Committee receives an annual update, with 
additional ad hoc reviews carried out where appropriate.
Our employees trust our Speak Up process, as evidenced by our 
April 24 Spirit Beat survey, with 87% of respondents agreeing that 
they believe appropriate action would be taken as a result of using 
the process. We also track the proportion of ‘named’ versus 
‘anonymous’ reports as a higher number of named reports suggests 
higher levels of trust in the Speak Up process. During the year, 
52% (FY23: 58%) of reports were ‘named’ and this was higher than 
available industry benchmarks.
This year, 6491 (FY23: 5051) separate concerns were reported using 
Speak Up. These concerns could relate to matters of unlawful 
behaviour or matters of integrity, such as bribery, fraud, price fixing, a 
conflict of interest, or a breach of data privacy. Reports could also 
relate to people issues such as discrimination, bullying or harassment, 
danger to the health and safety of employees or the public, or 
potential abuses of human rights.
If we decide to proceed with an investigation, a corporate security 
investigator or member of HR will investigate, keeping the person 
who raised the concern informed throughout the process. Where 
reports made to Speak Up require remedial action, this could include 
consequences at the individual level or changes to internal processes 
and procedures.
Speak Up is owned by the Chief Human Resources Officer and 
overseen by the Group Risk and Compliance Committee. 
Speak Up is also made available to our suppliers and is communicated 
through our Code of Ethical Purchasing. For suppliers that decide 
to maintain their own grievance mechanisms, we require that they 
inform us of any grievances raised relating to work done on behalf of 
Vodafone directly.

Privacy risks
As data volumes continue to grow and regulatory and customer 
scrutiny increases, it is important to be clear on the privacy risks we 
face, as well as how our policies and programmes can mitigate these. 
We categorise data privacy risk into three main areas:
 – Collection: collection of personal data without permissions, or 
excessive collection of data;
 – Access & use: use of personal data for unauthorised purposes, 
excessive data retention or poor data quality; and
 – Sharing: unauthorised disclosure of personal data, including 
supplier non-compliance with the law or our own policies.
To help us identify and manage evolving risks, we constantly evaluate 
our business strategy, new technologies, products and services, as 
well as government policies and regulation.
Privacy principles
Our privacy programme governs how we collect, use and manage our 
customers’ personal data to ensure we respect the confidentiality of 
their communications and any choices that they have made regarding 
the use of their data. Our privacy programme is based on the 
following principles: accountability; fairness and lawfulness; choice 
and access; security safeguards; privacy by design; openness and 
honesty; responsible data management; and balance.
Click to read more about our privacy principles and how they guide the way our 
products are designed and built: vodafone.com/privacy
Using customer data
We want to enable our customers to get the most out of our products 
and services. To provide these services, we need to use our customers’ 
personal information. We aim to protect our customers’ data and only 
to use it for a stated and specific purpose, and we are always open 
about what customer data we collect, and why we collect it.
Click to read more about uses of customer data:  
investors.vodafone.com/sasb
Each local market publishes a privacy statement to provide clear, 
transparent and relevant information on how we collect and use personal 
data, what choices are available regarding its use and how customers can 
exercise their rights. Our product-specific privacy notices include details 
relating to a particular product. These statements and notices are available 
to customers online, in the MyVodafone app and in our retail stores.
We provide our customers with access to their data through online and 
physical channels. These channels can be used to request deletion of data 
that is no longer necessary, or for correcting outdated or incorrect data, or 
for data portability. 
Our customer privacy statements and other customer-facing 
documents provide comprehensive information on how these rights 
can be exercised and how to raise complaints or contact the relevant 
data protection authority. Our frontline retail and customer support 
staff are trained to respond to customer requests.
Our state-of-the-art, multi-channel permission management 
approach has been deployed across our channels (MyVodafone app, 
website, call centres and retail stores) since 2018. This approach 
allows our customers to control how we use their data for marketing 
and other purposes at any time and the permissions are synchronised 
across our channels. For example, customers can:
 – Opt-in for the processing of special categories of data;
 – Choose what data we collect through the MyVodafone app and 
how it is used;
 – Opt-out from marketing across different channels (call, SMS, 
notifications), or opt-in to the use of their communications 
metadata for marketing purposes or for receiving third-party 
marketing messages; and
 – Opt-out from the use of anonymised network and location data 
(‘Vodafone Analytics’).

Operating model
We have an experienced team of privacy specialists dedicated to 
ensuring compliance with data protection laws and our policies in the 
countries where we operate.
We have a clear process for managing privacy risks across the data life cycle 
and teams from across Vodafone ensure end-to-end coverage. Dedicated 
security teams are tasked with applying appropriate technical and 
organisational information security measures to protect personal data against 
unauthorised access, disclosure, loss or use during transit and at rest.
Read more about cyber security  
on pages 46 to 51
All products, services and processes are subject to privacy impact 
assessments as part of their development and throughout their life 
cycle. We maintain personal data processing records, supplier privacy 
compliance, data breach management and individual rights 
processes, as well as internal and international data transfer 
compliance frameworks, and training and awareness programmes.
In our supply chain, privacy and security requirements form a key part 
of our supplier management processes. All suppliers go through a 
thorough onboarding process to verify their adherence to these 
requirements, with appropriate data protection measures and 
continuous monitoring agreed.
Our teams monitor and influence regulatory and industry 
developments and work to build and maintain relationships with local 
data protection authorities and other key stakeholders.
Our privacy control frameworks are subject to continuous risk-based 
improvements. In addition to introducing updates to our global privacy 
controls, we also require every employee, and where possible contractors, 
to complete DWR privacy training within six weeks of joining. In addition, 
they need to complete refresher courses in line with our annual learning 
intervention cycle. We also have targeted training for high-risk teams 
with a key role in personal data processing. With this approach we aim to 
achieve a 90% completion rate on both types of training for all target 
groups across our global footprint. In FY24, 94% of assigned 
employees completed DWR or more specific privacy training.
The effectiveness of control implementation is subject to quarterly 
reporting, and annual evidence-based testing by the privacy teams, 
as well as internal audit. Control implementation is also reviewed by 
local market CEOs, the Group Risk and Compliance Committee and 
the Audit and Risk Committee. Any findings are subject to remedial 
actions by the responsible control operator, and completion is monitored.
Customers 
Responsible use of data
Millions of people communicate and share information over our 
networks, enabling them to connect, innovate and prosper. 
Customers trust us with their data and maintaining this trust is critical. 
Data privacy
We believe that everyone has a right to privacy wherever they live in the 
world, and our commitment to our customers’ privacy goes beyond 
legal compliance. As a result, our privacy programme applies globally, 
irrespective of whether there are local data protection or privacy laws. 
Our privacy management policy is based on the European Union General 
Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and this is applied across Vodafone 
markets both inside and outside the European Economic Area. Our 
privacy management policy establishes a framework within which local 
data protection and privacy laws are respected and sets a baseline for 
those markets where there are no equivalent legal requirements.

Strategy
Our cyber security strategy
Our vision is a secure connected future for our customers and society. 
We are motivated by a clear purpose to inspire customer trust and 
loyalty through providing sustained cyber security, ultimately 
contributing to a secure society and an inclusive future for all.
Our cyber security strategy and operating model support our vision 
and goals, and form part of our wider Company strategy. Each year we 
refresh our cyber security strategy and every five years redevelop the 
cyber security strategy based on changes in the internal and external 
environment. 
Our strategy is based on core principles, including:
 – Act as an enabler for the business;
 – Be proactive, risk and threat-led, supported by data-driven 
decisions, automation and digitalisation;
 – Build and assure security in all products and services; and
 – Simplify architecture though partnership with key suppliers.
To implement these principles, our strategy is delivered through six 
pillars of change:
Control evolution: Maintain and improve our security controls and 
procedures beyond the existing cyber security baseline with an 
adaptive and risk-based framework; 
Secure by design: All products and services have security built in, 
whether we build them ourselves or buy them from vendors;
Dynamic trust: Strong zero-trust security based on dynamic 
risk-based access that is frictionless for users: for example, multi-
factor authentication and moving away from passwords;
Real-time data and real-time response: The next generation of our 
detection and response capability, more automated and based on 
advanced analytics;
Spirit of Vodafone and cyber culture: Engaging our people, nurturing 
our engineering community and Group-wide cyber security training 
and simulations; and 
Security for society: Collaborate widely to encourage standardisation, 
share intelligence, and engage on regulation.
Each year we define and communicate priorities for a three-year 
period, so all areas of our business are clear on the investment 
priorities for security. We track progress against these priorities 
throughout the year.
Year ahead
The priorities for the coming year include updating and redeveloping 
our cyber security strategy in line with future technology changes 
and expected threats. This strategy will position us to manage 
changes in technology, threats and the external environment. 
Key priorities for the year include:
 – Design and development of a new security operations platform;
 – Further strengthening of identity, access control and 
authentication; 
 – End-to-end security of our telecommunications networks, 
transforming how we manage the security of our third parties; and
 – New adaptive cyber risk methodology.
Alongside these priorities, we continue to focus on security control 
improvement, efficiency and automation, including automation of key risk 
indicators that provide data driven measurement of our security position.

Governance
The General Counsel and Company Secretary, a member of the 
Executive Committee, oversees the global privacy programme. The 
Group Privacy Officer, reporting to the General Counsel, is responsible 
for managing and overseeing the privacy programme on a day-to-day 
basis across the markets and provides regular status reports to the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary and an annual update to the 
Audit and Risk Committee. During the year, the Group Chief Executive 
conducted regular compliance reviews, to seek to ensure operating 
companies were adhering to the Group’s policies and procedures. This 
included oversight of our privacy programme.
Whilst each employee is responsible for protecting personal data they 
are trusted with, accountability for compliance sits with each 
operating company. A member of the local executive committee 
oversees the local implementation of our privacy programme. Each 
operating company also has a dedicated privacy officer, privacy legal 
counsel and other privacy specialists. Local privacy officers report to 
the Group Privacy Officer throughout the year.
The privacy leadership team approves new standards and guidelines and 
monitors the implementation of global privacy plans. Operating companies 
also maintain privacy steering committees that bring together privacy and 
security teams and senior management from relevant business functions.
Privacy incidents
We have a strong culture of data privacy and our assurance and 
monitoring activities are designed to identify potential issues before 
they materialise. However, during the financial year, excluding Italy 
and Spain, Vodafone was fined €42,000 (FY23: €65,000) for separate 
data privacy issues, primarily relating to marketing without consent, 
human and system errors in data processing, and delayed execution 
of data subject rights. In response, we have introduced new standards 
and increased monitoring.

Vodafone’s approach to responsible artificial intelligence (‘AI’) 
Vodafone’s AI governance approach demonstrates our desire to 
engage with AI in an ethical and responsible manner for the 
benefit of customers, employees, and society. We first released 
our ethical AI framework in 2019. We have further formalised our 
governance of AI. The AI Governance Board is a senior steering 
group that defines strategy and policy for AI and monitors its 
execution. The board is chaired by the Vodafone Chief Commercial 
Officer, and is attended by the CEO of Vodafone Business, Chief 
Technology Officer, Chief HR Officer and Chief Legal Officer. 
The AI Governance Board is supported by the following functions: 
the Global AI Data and Analytics function leads the deployment of 
the AI initiatives. The AI innovation team drives AI innovation. HR is 
responsible for upskilling our workforce, and the Responsible AI 
Office ensures compliance and ethical use of AI, together with our 
Secure and Privacy by Design and External Affairs teams.
Case study: De-risking personal data with synthetic data 
Privacy enhancing technologies (‘PET’s) reduce the risks 
associated with personal data. PETs are part of Vodafone’s privacy 
risk management approach. Vodafone has been experimenting 
with synthetic data recently. Synthetic data is data that is 
artificially created instead of collected from real-world events, it is 
produced by algorithms and is used, for example, to replace test 
data sets of production or operational data, test mathematical 
models, train machine learning models, or run different analytics 
use cases. Synthetic data is not personal data, but it maintains the 
statistical features of the original data. This means it can be used 
for many use cases without regulatory obstacles.

New technologies and industry collaboration
We adopt new technologies to better serve our customers and gain 
operational efficiency. For every technology programme, new or 
existing, we follow our Secure by Design process, evaluating suppliers’ 
hardware and software, modelling threats and understanding the risks 
before designing, implementing and testing the necessary security 
controls and procedures.
Mobile networks
Every new mobile network generation has brought increased 
performance and capability, along with new opportunities in security. 
As we deploy 5G core networks alongside our 5G radio networks, 
often described as 5G Standalone, we have updated our security 
standards to implement the latest 5G features in our core networks. 
We also test security in our radio networks using independent 
third-party testing companies.
OpenRAN is a new way of building and managing radio access 
network (‘RAN’) components within telecommunication 
infrastructure. Instead of purchasing all the components from one 
supplier, we use hardware and software components from multiple 
vendors and integrate these via open interfaces. Over time, this will 
create a more competitive landscape for telecommunications 
equipment. We continue to collaborate with other players in the 
OpenRAN ecosystem to improve security. This includes adding 
requirements to the OpenRAN specification, publishing internal 
security standards, and benchmarking vendors against these. The first 
OpenRAN sites are now live in the UK, Romania and DRC. 
Quantum computing
We are preparing for a time when quantum computing is available at 
scale. Through our joint research with IBM, we have developed a 
risk-based approach to mitigate the risks of existing cryptography, 
which could be more easily broken by a quantum computer. We are 
identifying potential quantum vulnerabilities, defining supplier 
requirements and developing the ability to update our cryptography 
when new threats emerge. Vodafone also co-chairs the 
telecommunications industry-wide task force on this issue. 
Artificial intelligence (‘AI’)
We take the responsible use of AI seriously and seek to balance the 
opportunities and risks associated with AI, and more recently 
generative AI (‘Gen AI’). Teams from across the business are 
collaborating under the governance of a global AI governance board 
which agrees policy, mitigates threats, identifies and selects use cases 
for implementation. 
Read more about AI governance 
on page 46
We are experimenting with public and private Large Language Models 
(‘LLMs’) to support a range of potential business cases. To date, two 
private versions of models have been reviewed and approved though 
our Secure by Design process. To reduce the risks of misuse, we limit 
access to specific public LLMs. We have developed an awareness 
programme and updated our guidance and policies to make it clear to 
our employees what data must not be shared in a public AI model.
We have defined requirements for internal LLM application 
development including risk assessment, designing for transparency, 
lack of bias and providing the right degree of human oversight of 
results. If the AI model could have a high impact on people, we 
require a human to have input on the final decision.
We are also investigating the use of AI to augment our cyber security 
processes. The first proof of concept is a cyber security chatbot which 
can answer employee questions on cyber policies and standards. We 
are also part of cross-industry forums which collaborate on 
telcommunication-specific AI use cases, including threat detection, 
investigation and response.
Industry collaboration
We actively engage with stakeholders across industry, with regulators, 
standard-setting bodies and governments. Collaboration is vital to 
respond to threats, protect our organisation and workforce, and build 
safe online and digital spaces for customers and society. We use our 
expertise and experience to engage with a wide range of organisations 
to help improve the understanding of cyber security thinking and 
practice, and contribute to public policy, technical standards, 
information sharing, risk assessment, and governance. For example, 
we have engaged in cross-industry collaboration through the 
European Round Table, where we chair the CISO committee. We have 
an appointed member on the National Cyber Advisory Board in the 
UK. We also collaborate with other telecommunication companies, 
and actively engage in security standards working groups such as 
ENISA 5G Cyber Security Certification, O-RAN Alliance Security Focus 
Group and GSMA Fraud and Security Group.
Risk management
Identification of vulnerabilities and risks
Cyber attacks are part of the technology landscape today and will be 
in the future. All organisations, governments and people will be subject 
to cyber attacks and some will be successful, leading to security incidents. 
The telecommunications industry is faced with a unique set of risks as we 
provide connectivity services and handle private communication data.
As a result, cyber security is one of Vodafone’s principal risks. A 
successful cyber attack could cause serious harm to the Company or its 
customers, including unavailability of services or a data breach leading 
to disclosure or misuse of customer personal data. The consequences 
could include, but are not limited to, exposure to contractual liability, 
litigation, regulatory action, or damage to the company’s reputation and 
brand and loss of market share. In the worst case, the cyber security 
incident could cause material financial impact to the Company.
There is increasing regulatory focus on cyber security and requirements 
for telecommunications providers to improve their cyber security 
practices. The Company is subject to GDPR and equivalent legislation 
in many countries in which it operates. In addition, there are cyber 
focused local laws and regulations, for example in the UK with the 
Telecoms Security Act. A cyber incident may therefore lead to 
regulatory fines and other enforcement activities if deemed to be due 
to inadequate security. Measures to meet these laws and regulations 
will also result in increased compliance costs.
We dedicate significant resources to reducing cyber security risks, 
however due to the nature of the threats, we cannot provide absolute 
security and some cyber security incidents will occur.
Risk and threat management are fundamental to maintaining the 
security of our services across every aspect of our business. We 
separate cyber security risk into three main areas of risk:
 – External: A wide variety of attackers, including criminals and state-
backed groups, target our networks, systems and people using a range 
of techniques and procedures. They seek to gain unauthorised access to 
steal or manipulate data or disrupt our services. Geopolitical factors also 
increase the threat of an external attack;
 – Insider: Our employees may accidentally leak information or 
maliciously misuse their privileges to steal confidential data or to 
cause disruption; and
 – Supply chain: We only have indirect control over the cyber security 
of third-party service providers, limiting our ability to defend against 
cyber threats to these third parties. Such attacks, if successful, could 
cause services to be unavailable or enable a data breach to occur.
To help us identify and manage emerging and evolving risks, we 
constantly evaluate and challenge our business strategy, new 
technologies, government policies and regulation, and cyber threats.

Other information

We conduct regular reviews of the most significant security risks 
affecting our business and develop strategies and policies to detect, 
prevent and respond to them. Our cyber security strategy focuses on 
minimising the risk of cyber incidents that affect our networks and 
services. When incidents do occur, we identify the root causes and 
use them to improve our controls and procedures.
Cyber security risk is aligned with Vodafone’s enterprise risk framework. 
Each principal risk owner is responsible to produce a formal Line of 
Sight document twice a year that describes the risk, the Company’s 
risk tolerance, current position, control position and actions to move 
to tolerance if required. Second and third line assurance supporting 
the report is also included in the Line of Sight document.
Risk and control approach
The global Cyber and Information Security policy applies to all 
Vodafone-controlled entities. Each security domain has a more 
detailed supporting policy document with detailed control objectives. 
The policies are underpinned by security standards which provide 
relevant technical specifications. 
Control framework
Security controls and procedures define the requirements which allow our 
policies to be met. These controls and procedures are designed to prevent, 
detect or respond to threats. Most risks and threats are prevented from 
occurring and we expect most will be detected before they cause harm and 
need a response. 
We have defined a common global control framework called the Cyber 
Security Baseline (‘CSB’) and adoption is mandatory across the entire Group. 
We based the CSB on the ISO 27001 international standard, mapping those 
controls to our cyber risks to identify the most impactful. Our original 
baseline included 48 key controls, this has grown to 56 as we have 
reviewed and identified new controls to counter new cyber threats. 
All controls in the baseline need to be effective in all entities. We define 
effectiveness based on the depth of the control implementation and 
coverage of the relevant assets. We understand that cyber security controls 
need to be continuously evolved and enhanced to mitigate risks and threats. 
Each year we set new annual targets, and progress against the targets is 
monitored and reported to the senior leadership team in each market and 
the technology leadership team quarterly. We update our priorities with 
changes, including any necessary new controls and procedures. 
In addition to this top-down process of risk identification and mitigation, we 
identify individual cyber risks at the product or system level, for example 
through our Secure by Design process, operational activities, scanning and 
monitoring, or through an incident. Risks are evaluated on a common 
impact and likelihood scale, mitigating actions are agreed and captured in a 
risk register. Any high risks identified through these processes require senior 
management oversight and agreement of mitigating actions.
Adaptive risk and control methodology
A risk and control methodology is important to drive action in any 
company. We are launching a new global methodology for cyber security 
risk management, which was developed with the assistance of a major 
consulting firms. During FY25 we will retire the CSB and replace it with the 
new methodology. This methodology has a greater focus on risk and 
threats but retains the structured control framework and common targets 
of CSB. Controls are vital to reduce risk and initially we will continue to use 
the same control set under the new methodology. To adapt to the 
changing threat landscape, the new methodology introduces threat and 
risk scenarios. The threats and specific attack techniques are mapped to the 
controls that most significantly reduce risk, allowing gaps to be highlighted. 
The control framework will continue to evolve based on technology 
changes, our strategic and business priorities, and changing regulation. 
Over the next three years, we intend to automate the capture and reporting 
of key risk indicator data from source systems. This will reduce manual 
effort, be more accurate and provide stronger assurance of effectiveness. 
Further, to better quantify residual risk, we have also created a risk 
quantification model based on threats, control effectiveness and incident 
data. This will be tested and launched during FY25. 
Assurance
A dedicated technology assurance team review and validate the 
effectiveness of our cyber security controls and procedures, and our 
control environment is subject to regular internal audit. We test the 
security of our mobile networks every year using a specialist testing 
company, they also benchmark our security against other 
telecommunications operators. This provides assurance that we are 
maintaining the highest standards and our telecommunications 
controls are operating effectively. We have also appointed external 
specialists to perform testing on our security controls (‘red teaming’) 
to uncover any areas for improvement. We maintain externally audited 
information security certifications, including ISO 27001, which cover 
our global technology function and 11 local markets. In addition, our 
markets comply with national information security requirements where 
applicable. All systems going live and those undergoing change are 
independently penetration tested. An internal team performs some 
testing, and we engage third party testers where appropriate. Across 
Vodafone, we complete over 1,0001 penetration tests every year. We 
also perform adversary testing exercises using independent third parties.
Supply chain
As well as monitoring control effectiveness within Vodafone, we oversee 
the cyber security of our suppliers and third parties. Controls and 
procedures are embedded in the supplier lifecycle to set requirements, 
assess the risk and monitor each supplier’s security performance. 
At supplier onboarding, minimum security requirements are written into 
contracts, and we determine the inherent risk of the supplier based on the 
service they are providing. We then assess their controls and procedures 
using a questionnaire to understand the residual risk, which informs the 
frequency of review from annual to every three years. We follow up on 
open actions and ensure any security incidents are tracked and managed.
Regulatory landscape
We expect a continued increase in security regulation over the next few 
years as governments respond to the heightened cyber threat landscape, 
recognising that telecommunications operators provide critical national 
infrastructure. We engage directly with governments and industry partners 
to promote proportionate, risk-based and cost-effective solutions to security 
threats. We look to establish shared approaches to reinforce standardisation 
and regulatory frameworks that apply equally to all market participants.
In the UK, we are implementing the provisions of the 
Telecommunications Security Act which sets enhanced security 
requirements for UK network operators and their suppliers. In Europe, 
individual member states have their own current or pending legislation, 
which incorporate EU-wide standards such as the 5G Security toolbox 
and the Network and Information Security 2 Directive. We continue to 
monitor the forthcoming EU Cyber Resilience Act which aims to 
ensure that all digital products and services fulfil the same security 
requirements. 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) introduced new cyber 
security incident disclosure and periodic reporting requirements in 
December 2023. We have updated our incident management process to 
include the relevant disclosure steps should a material incident occur; this is 
described in the Cyber Operations and Incidents section. Where applicable 
we have expanded these cyber security disclosures in response to the new 
reporting requirements.
Operating model
Our approach to cyber security
We have implemented a globally consistent cyber security operating 
model that is based on the leading industry security standards published 
by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (‘NIST’). The 
model is designed to reduce risk by constantly identifying threats, 
protecting, defending and improving our security. We operate cyber 
capabilities with an in-house international team of over 9001 
employees.

We augment our internal capabilities where necessary with third-party 
specialist technical expertise, such as digital forensics, red teaming 
and penetration testing. We use specialist resources to perform testing 
of our telecommunications networks. We also use qualified external 
resources to help during the implementation of change and improvement 
projects. Our scale means we benefit from global collaboration, technology 
sharing and deep expertise, and ultimately have greater visibility of emerging 
threats. An example would be our global security operations centre which 
takes inputs and telemetry from all the markets where we operate.

The Chief Technology Officer has been at Vodafone since 2009. 
During that time he has held positions in Vodafone Business Product 
Management and Technology, has been UK CTO and since 2021 the 
Chief Digital & Information Officer leading an integrated Europe-wide 
technology team. 
Within the cyber security organisation, led by the CTAS Director, we have 
heads of global cyber security functions, local markets and regional cyber 
security leaders. This global leadership team is responsible for directing, 
managing and reducing cyber risk across Vodafone. Market and regional 
cyber security leaders are also part of their local management teams, with a 
dotted matrix reporting line to local chief information officers. 
The CTAS Director has led cyber security in Vodafone since 2015. Prior 
to joining Vodafone, the CTAS Director was chief security officer at a 
large UK bank, after previously holding security and technology audit 
leadership roles in financial services and the UK postal service. The 
CTAS Director is an independent advisor for a large UK retail company, 
a member of the UK Cabinet Office National Cyber Advisory Board and 
holds several other industry advisory and committee roles. Our broader 
cyber leadership team has significant cyber security and technology 
risk experience across business sectors including telecommunications, 
financial services and professional services. 
The cyber security leadership team reviews detailed metrics monthly 
covering security controls status, updates about the threat landscape, 
and specific key risk indicators (‘KRIs’) for our most important controls. 
Examples of KRIs include results of independent network testing by 
third parties, vulnerability management, patching, hardening and 
endpoint security status, and incident metrics. Internal reporting 
provides a detailed view of progress and risk reduction. If markets are 
consistently not achieving targets, they are expected to have plans in 
place to recover.
Quarterly summary management reporting is provided to the technology 
leadership team and Executive Committee. This is supplemented by 
monthly control status reports which track targets and are discussed in 
regular meetings with local market leadership teams. 
The top level Cyber and Information Security policy is approved 
annually by the CTO. To provide functional governance, we have a 
quarterly Cyber Risk Council meeting, chaired by the Head of Cyber 
Governance Risk and Control, and attended by the CTAS Director, the 
CTAS leadership team and cyber security leaders from each market. 
The meeting reviews and approves detailed cyber policies and standards, 
monitors cyber risk and threat, and oversees key strategic programmes. 
Cyber security risk is also reported to and monitored by more senior 
committees including the Technology and Audit and Risk Committee, 
chaired by Internal Audit and the Vodafone Group Risk and Compliance 
committee, chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’). The CTAS 
Director attends both of those committees to provide updates as required. 
Board
The Board Audit and Risk Committee (‘ARC’) is the responsible committee 
for the oversight of risks from cyber security threats. The Committee 
receives updates from Internal Audit throughout the year. The Line of Sight 
report documents the risk tolerance, risk position and mitigating actions for 
each principal risk of the company, including cyber threat. This is presented 
and reviewed annually.
In addition, the Committee reviews cyber risk based on a paper and 
presentation from the CTO and CTAS Director. The report collates the data 
that covers all local markets’ security status. The paper also typically 
includes threat landscape, incidents, security position, residual risk, strategy 
and programme progress across the Company. The most recent update 
was provided in March 2024.
The Chair of the Board’s Audit and Risk Committee is the Senior Independent 
Director of the Board. A former CEO at a UK financial services company, 
he has significant experience of overseeing technology and cyber issues.

Purpose (continued)
During the year, the Board formed a Technology Committee which 
assists the Board by overseeing how technology underpins company 
strategy. Cyber security was discussed in the first meeting of the 
Committee, covering the changing business, technology and cyber 
threat landscape.
The Cyber Code
The Vodafone Cyber Code has been designed to simplify and explain 
basic security controls and procedures to all employees. The Cyber 
Code is embedded in our Code of Conduct and is the cornerstone of 
how we expect all employees to behave when it comes to best 
practice in cyber security. It consists of seven areas where employees 
must follow good security practice.

Threats and incidents
Threat landscape and intelligence
An important part of our operating model is to gather intelligence and 
insights about threats. The cyber threat landscape continues to be 
volatile across all sectors, with wide-ranging threat actors. Our cyber 
security team use industry and external analysis to help shape our 
controls and procedures, and drive actions. When specific vendor or 
new high impact vulnerabilities are reported, we drive global 
remediation across Vodafone.
Geopolitical instability, conflict and tensions often lead to an increase 
in cyber threats from state-backed and criminal threat actors. This can 
lead to disruption, data theft and integrity compromise. Cross-industry 
and government collaboration is vital.
Ransomware and data extortion attacks are common to companies of 
all sizes. The threat is increasing. Based on public reporting, some 
companies are paying ransoms, aggravating the threat.
Attackers are increasingly trying to log in, rather than hack in. As such, 
social engineering methods are a common means for attackers to 
gain access. Emerging technologies such as AI will enhance 
techniques such as voice phishing and deep fakes. Harvested 
credentials continue to be sought and shared by threat actors. 
Attackers can target executives following media announcements and 
public reporting.
The speed of vulnerability exploitation is very fast, with a trend for 
targeting internet-facing software.
In 2023, the European Commission highlighted the number of supply 
chain attacks in Europe has tripled. Supplier attacks against all sectors 
are likely to increase in the coming year. 
We anticipate threats will continue from existing sources, as well as 
evolving in new technology areas such as AI and quantum computing.
Cyber operations and incidents
As a global connectivity provider, we see a range of cyber threats. We 
use our layers of controls to identify, block and mitigate threats and 
reduce business or customer impact. Our global security operations 
capability handles trillions of events and logs from sensors across our 
footprint, detecting potential threats and events. Low severity issues 
are dealt with quickly, for example by malware containment or 
isolating an individual device. More significant events are triaged to 
our 24/7 incident management and response team. We operate a 
single global team and capability.
Where a security incident occurs, we have a consistent incident 
management framework to manage our response and recovery. 
The focus of our incident responders is always fast risk mitigation and 
customer security. 
In the event of a cyber breach, disclosure is made to the relevant 
authorities in line with local and global regulations and laws and a risk 
assessment considering the impact on customers. This may include 
law enforcement as well as regulators. The European Union’s GDPR 
provides a framework for notifying customers in the event there is a 
loss of customer data because of a data breach, and this framework is 
a baseline across all our markets. Our data privacy officers are a key 
part of the response where incidents impact personal data. We will 
also notify the SEC if an incident is deemed material.

Culture, training and awareness
Training and awareness
Our cyber security awareness approach is to educate our employees 
to protect themselves and our customers from cyber threats. Cyber 
security training is mandatory as part of our Doing What’s Right 
programme. The training module is designed by the cyber security 
team to inform employees of key threats and how to avoid them. The 
cyber leadership team are actively involved in shaping the approach 
and in specific employee communication. The corporate security 
function lead on all employee security training and they deliver the 
programme and materials. Mandatory training runs every other year 
with a short refresher and knowledge check in the intermediate year. 
If the knowledge check is failed, the employees are required to retake 
the full cyber security training module. During the year we launched a 
training manual for contractors, so they also receive the same level of 
awareness. Training on cyber security is also included in our induction 
process for new employees. We track completion rates to ensure 
every employee completes mandatory training when assigned.
Read more about our approach to mandatory  
Doing What’s Right training on page 44
Cyber security training is reinforced by regular digital communications 
delivered via our internal social media platform, through videos and 
webinars. We respond to threats with specific targeted advice, such as the 
use of multi-factor authentication and reminders to not share credentials.
We perform phishing simulations across all markets and functions to raise 
awareness and train employees. We target at least two exercises per market 
or function per year. We also run multi-market simulations to allow us to 
compare responses consistently – in the most recent exercise we sent over 
100,0001 emails to nine1 European markets and Group functions. Those 
who click on the link in the phishing message or share their credentials 
receive immediate training. We are now rolling out this multi-market 
approach to our African markets. 
We also provided focused training for our Executive Committee. This year, 
we covered social engineering threats, use of social media, travel to 
high-risk countries, using devices securely and how to share confidential 
information safely. The training materials were cascaded to their teams by 
ExCo members.
We have continued to undertake incident simulations for local 
executive committees, most recently for Greece. The simulations 
provide CEOs and their teams a realistic and tailored experience of 
managing a cyber incident and exercising their responsibilities in 
accordance with our common approach.
Growing our skills
We enable employees in our cyber teams to maintain and grow their skills 
to better protect our customers. Our company learning platform hosts 
cyber training on technical topics, platforms and frameworks. Employees 
can study towards recognised information security and cyber certifications 
aligned to their learning plans.
Since 2020 we have organised twice yearly cyber connect events for our 
entire global cyber security team. The events include a recap of our strategy 
and achievements, messages from senior leadership, external industry 
speakers, collaborative breakout groups and technical track sessions to 
learn about cyber topics and best practice. We use technology to enable a 
hybrid experience with some attending in offices and some remote.

Other information

We classify security incidents on a scale according to severity, 
measured by potential business and customer impact. The highest 
severity category of event is called Severity 0 down to the lowest 
Severity 4. Severity 0 corresponds to a significant data breach or loss 
of service caused by the incident. If a Severity 0 incident occurs, we 
notify the Executive Committee, the Board and external auditors and 
provide regular updates. A crisis group is formed composed of 
relevant senior management who oversee the response.
SEC requirements have been incorporated into our incident 
management process. In the event of a Severity 0 incident, the 
Disclosure Committee (composed of the CFO and General Counsel) 
would decide if a UK market disclosure is necessary for materiality 
reasons, that would also trigger disclosure to the SEC.
In the past two financial years, no incidents have been Severity 0. In FY22 
we experienced one Severity 0 in Vodafone Portugal in February 2022 
and in FY21 we experienced one Severity 0 incident at Italy Ho. Mobile in 
December 2020. Details of these two previous disclosures are in our FY23 
Cyber Security Factsheet. These incidents did not have a material impact 
on the Company’s business strategy, results of operations or financial 
condition.
Whilst overall incident volumes have remained stable, a higher 
proportion of these are at suppliers and third parties. In FY24, 55% of 
severity 1 and 2 incidents were related to our suppliers and third parties 
(FY23; 47%). We contractually require our suppliers to report incidents 
and we track and manage the incidents using the same framework as 
we do for internal events. In two cases in this financial year, our team 
helped a supplier recover services after a ransomware attack. Neither of 
these incidents were material to Vodafone’s business strategy, results 
of operations or financial condition.
When incidents are closed, we complete a post-incident review to 
learn the lessons from the incident, including the root cause and any 
improvements needed. 
Cyber insurance is an important part of our risk management and 
mitigation approach. Vodafone holds cyber liability insurance 
alongside business interruption and professional indemnity policies. 
Should a serious cyber event occur, we could recover the costs in 
whole or in part through these policies.

Society 
Protecting people
Wherever we operate, we have an opportunity to 
contribute to the advancement of fundamental 
rights for our customers, colleagues and communities. 
We are also conscious of the risks associated with 
our operations, and we work hard to mitigate 
negative impacts, ensuring we keep people safe.
Mobiles, masts and health
The health and safety of our customers and the wider public has 
always been, and continues to be, a priority for us. Our masts fully 
comply with national regulations, which are typically based on, or go 
beyond, international guidelines set by the independent scientific 
body, the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation 
Protection (‘ICNIRP’). There has been scientific research on mobile 
frequencies for decades, including those used by 5G. If exposure is 
within national regulations, the scientific consensus is that there is no 
adverse impact on health. We continually monitor and evaluate our 
mobile networks to make sure we meet all regulations. In addition, all 
the products we sell are rigorously evaluated to ensure they comply 
with international safety guidelines.
As well as complying with national regulations, markets that have 
rolled out 5G apply the Smart PowerLock (‘SPL’) feature. This 
technology, designed for use with the adaptive antennas used for 5G, 
continuously monitors the transmitted radio frequency power of the 
antenna to ensure it is always below a threshold when averaged 
over a predefined time window. This takes into account compliance 
with electromagnetic field (‘EMF’) regulations under all possible 
operating conditions for 5G sites. This is now one of many software 
features that are routinely active on 5G sites. SPL also includes 
statistics that can be used to build evidence of compliance over 
several weeks for a given site if needed by regulators. National 
regulators have accepted the feature as effective.
Science monitoring
Scientific reviews have made a vital contribution to establishing 
industry guidelines and standards. We follow the results of these 
independent expert reviews to understand developments in scientific 
research related to mobile devices, base stations and health.
We continue to fund research into mobile devices, base stations and 
health through funding bodies such as national governments to 
ensure that the research remains independent of industry influence, 
including our own. We also respond to requests from bodies 
conducting research by providing technical advice and information on 
the use of mobile devices. This helps to ensure scientists have access 
to the best-quality information available.
Harmonisation with international science-based guidelines
Following the publication in 2020 of updated international guidelines on 
electromagnetic frequencies, we have supported and promoted the 
transition from the previous guidelines from 1998 to this more up-to-date 
and appropriate set. In EU Member States, the EMF regulations are set 
nationally with most being aligned with the ICNIRP guidelines. In the last 
year, in the city of Brussels, conditions have been changed to allow for the 
rollout of 5G services. 
Click to read more about ICNIRP 2020:

Operating model
We have robust governance mechanisms in place and conduct 
regular compliance assessments to ensure that our products meet 
the standards set by the Group policy and national regulations. 
The Group EMF leadership team meets through the year and  
reports to the Executive Committee and the Board.
We conduct network measurements and calculations of EMF 
exposure from network masts and review the test reports we receive 
on EMF testing on devices.
Human rights
We want to make sure that we have a positive impact on people and 
society, which includes respecting human rights in all our operations. 
We are a long-standing member of the UN Global Compact and our 
approach is guided by the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).

backed up by our internal Human Rights Policy, which sets out how 
our people must ensure we respect human rights, including steps to 
take through our other aligned policies, such as those covering 
artificial intelligence, ethical purchasing, responsible minerals, health 
and safety, human resources, privacy, business resilience and law 
enforcement assistance.

Purpose (continued)
Human rights risks
As a global telecommunications operator, we connect people. 
This means that globally our most significant human rights risks relate 
to our customers’ rights to privacy, concerning their data that we 
safeguard, and freedom of expression, in terms of their ability to receive, 
seek and share information, through the connections we provide. Local 
laws and regulations can mandate that telecommunications operators 
must assist governments, and we must comply with lawful government 
requests as part of our operating licences. This might include the 
disclosure of customer information or limiting access to digital networks 
and services. However, our internal law enforcement assistance policy 
guides us on how to do this in a rights-respecting way, and our 
transparency reporting provides data on certain requests we receive.

vodafone.com/handling-law-enforcement-demands
The risks to people working throughout our supply chain are another area 
of focus for us. We manage these risks through our responsible supply 
chain programme, which assesses our suppliers for indicators such as 
forced labour and other risks to human rights, such as health and safety. As 
members of the Joint Alliance for CSR (‘JAC’), we benefit from JAC-led 
on-site supplier audits and sharing of best practices with other 
telecommunications operators to enhance our supply chain management. 
We believe in supporting the responsible sourcing of minerals globally. 
Although we do not source minerals ourselves, we follow the best practice 
of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to understand whether our 
manufactured products include minerals that have been sourced from 
smelters taking a responsible approach to sourcing.
Our human rights programme also addresses a broader range of 
human rights risks, such as those relating to the design and 
deployment of artificial intelligence, children’s rights, data ethics and 
risks we may become connected with through our broader value 
chain, such as enterprise customers or partner markets.
Our approach
We conduct due diligence in line with our internal policies to proactively 
identify and address potential negative human rights impacts. Due 
diligence comes in various forms and at different moments in our 
operations: it may be an independent human rights risk assessment 
for a new market entry, the ongoing assessments we do when considering 
new partner markets, roaming partnerships, the deployment of artificial 
intelligence or the development of new products and services. 
We follow up assessments of actual or potential material negative human 
rights impacts with what we consider to be appropriate mitigating actions, 
such as contractual commitments to respect human rights in our partner 
market agreements and in our enterprise customer contracts. 
We maintain a grievance mechanism ‘Speak Up’ accessible to all 
individuals in our workforce or supply chain, providing a platform to 
raise concerns about human rights issues.
strong support for a culture of respect for human rights while 
identifying actionable improvements, such as consolidating and 
simplifying our policy architecture and accountability structure and 
building and empowering our Human Rights Champions network. In 
FY24, we have updated our Human Rights policy and relaunched our 
Human Rights Champions network. In FY25, we will conduct a review 
of our Human Rights Advisory Group’s terms of reference and 
membership structure with the aim to report on our progress. 
Collaboration
We play our part in developing the global understanding of what 
businesses should do to respect human rights. We were placed 
second in the Ranking Digital Rights 2022 Telco Giants Scorecard, 
maintaining our position from the 2020 Index. We are a member of 
initiatives such as the GSMA Mobile Alliance to combat Digital Child 
Sexual Exploitation and the United Nations B-Tech Project, which 
convenes business, civil society and government to advance 
implementation of the UN Guiding Principles in the tech sector. This 
year, as part of the Human Rights 75 Initiative, we joined with other 
B-Tech Community of Practice members to make a public pledge to 
continue engaging with other companies to share experiences of 
implementing our respect for human rights commitments. 
Responsible supply chain
We spend approximately €19 billion a year with 8,000 direct suppliers 
around the world1 to meet our businesses’ and customers’ 
needs across network infrastructure, IT and services related to fixed 
lines, mobile masts and data centres that run our networks.
The majority of our external spend is managed by our Vodafone 
Procurement Company (‘VPC’) based in Luxembourg, and our shared 
services organisation (‘_VOIS’) based in Ahmedabad, India. A large 
area of spend is on the products we sell to our customers, including 
mobile phones, smartwatches, tablets, SIM cards, broadband routers, 
TV set-top boxes and Internet of Things devices. This centralised 
approach helps to ensure that we maintain a consistent approach to 
supplier management across Vodafone, from onboarding and vetting 
a supplier to raising orders and paying for delivered goods and services.
Supply chain risks
We work with other operators collaboratively on supply chain risks 
within the Joint Alliance for CSR (‘JAC’). We currently chair the 
association of telecommunications operators established to improve 
ethical, labour and environmental standards in the technology supply 
chain. We are engaged in workstreams to make progress towards 
reducing Scope 3 GHG emissions. 
JAC reports on progress with respect to third-party factory audits of 
common suppliers carried out on behalf of all its members in its own 
reporting. Please refer to their website for details.

Policy
This year we updated our Code of Ethical Purchasing which every 
supplier that works for Vodafone is required to comply with. These 
commitments extend down through the supply chain so that a supplier 
with which we have a direct contractual relationship (Tier 1 supplier) in 
turn is required to ensure compliance across its own direct supply chain 
(Tier 2 supplier from Vodafone’s perspective) and beyond. The Code of 
Ethical Purchasing is based on international standards, including the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour 
Organization’s Fundamental Conventions on Labour Standards. It 
stipulates the social, ethical and environmental standards that we 
expect, including in areas such as child and forced labour, health and 
safety, working hours, discrimination and disciplinary processes.

Governance
The Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer oversees our human 
rights programme and is a member of the Executive Committee. The 
Human Rights Manager, working closely with the Vodacom Group 
Human Rights Principal Specialist, manages our programme, and is 
supported by a cross-functional internal Human Rights Advisory 
Group, comprising senior managers responsible for privacy, security, 
responsible sourcing and diversity and inclusion, amongst others. We 
report regularly on our progress to the Purpose and Reputation 
Steering Committee, which assists the Executive Committee in 
fulfilling duties with regard to our purpose, reputation management 
and policy. This year, we concluded a review of our human rights 
impacts, governance and controls, which recognised Vodafone’s

Our approach
When new suppliers tender for work, they are asked to demonstrate 
compliance to policies and procedures that support safe working, diversity 
in the workplace, and to address carbon reduction, renewable energy, 
plastic reduction, circular economy and product life cycle which account 
for up to 20% of the overall evaluation criteria. Commitments made by our 
suppliers are assessed against our own purpose strategy with respect 
to diversity and inclusion (5%), the environment (5%) and health and safety 
(10%) in categories where there is a safety risk. We have included purpose 
criteria in all tenders since FY22. 
We continue to assess risk during our onboarding process by using a 
Supplier Assurance Risk Management (SARM) system for new suppliers in 
critical-to-business areas. The system uses logic to qualify suppliers in high 
risk areas that are material to our business, namely cyber security, data 
privacy, corporate security, environment, antibribery, responsible sourcing, 
health and safety and payment card industry. Any identified risks require an 
independent policy expert to approve suppliers before they are onboarded 
and if necessary to establish a mitigation plan. Our requirements are backed 
up by risk assessments, audits and operational improvement processes. 
To date, we have improved the supplier qualification process across 19 
countries and entities using a risk-based assessment that reviews 
compliance of any new suppliers before being onboarded to Vodafone. We 
will continue the rollout across local markets throughout the course of 
FY25 provided Workers’ Council approval is available.
We report on our approach to preventing modern slavery and human 
trafficking in our business and supply chain in our Modern 
Slavery Statement.

vodafone.com/modern-slavery-statement
Governance
The Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) oversees our supply chain and is a 
member of the Executive Committee and Board. Reporting to the 
CFO, the Chief Executive Officer of the VPC is responsible for the 
implementation of our Code of Ethical Purchasing. Progress is 
reported regularly to the VPC Board. Procurement is a highly 
centralised function within the business, with the majority of our 
external spend managed by the VPC. This enables us to maintain a 
consistent approach to supplier management and makes it easier to 
monitor and improve supplier performance across our markets.
Business integrity
We aim to ensure that our business operates 
ethically, lawfully and with integrity wherever we 
operate as this is critical to our long-term success.
Tax and economic contribution
As a major investor, taxpayer and employer, we make a significant 
contribution to the economies of the countries where we operate. 
In addition to direct and indirect taxation, our financial contributions 
to governments also include other areas such as radio spectrum fees 
and spectrum auction proceeds.
Tax transparency
Our tax report sets out our total contribution to public finances on a 
cash-paid basis for both 2022 and 2023. In 2023, we contributed, 
directly and indirectly, €9.3 billion (€12.1 billion including Italy and 
Spain) to public finances worldwide, compared with €8.2 billion (€9.9 
billion including Italy and Spain) in 2022. The year-on-year increase 
was due to €0.4 billion corporate income tax payments across Europe, 
as well as €0.3 billion indirect taxes and €0.3 billion other 
telecommunications specific economic contributions, such as 
payments for the right use spectrum. In 2023, we paid over €2.6 
billion in direct taxes, nearly €1.3 billion via telecommunications 
specific economic contributions, and collected nearly €5.4 billion in 
corporate income taxes for governments around the world. 
Maintaining trust in the creation and execution of our tax strategy, 
policies and practices is absolutely core to our approach to tax, as is 
our focus on transparency. We disclose our financial contributions to 
governments at a country level, as we believe this is an important way 
to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve an effective balance 
between a company’s responsibilities to society as a whole, through 
the payment of taxes and other government revenue-raising 
mechanisms, and its obligations to shareholders including that they 
understand our approach to taxation, policies and principles. The 
information we share aims to help our stakeholders understand our 
approach, policies, and principles.
We share our views on key topics of relevance, including the latest 
on the taxation of the digital economy, as well as by publishing our 
OECD country-by-country disclosure, as submitted to the UK’s tax 
authority, HMRC. In addition, we also publish how our disclosures 
compare to the B Team tax principles and the requirements of the 
Global Reporting Initiative.
Our tax report for 2024 will be published by the end of the financial 
year, following the submission of our tax returns and payment of all 
applicable taxes.

Anti-bribery, corruption and fraud
At Vodafone, we support and foster a culture of zero tolerance 
towards bribery, corruption or fraud in all our activities.
Our anti-bribery policy
Our policy on this issue is summarised in our Code of Conduct and 
states that employees or others working on our behalf must never 
offer or accept any kind of bribe. Our anti-bribery policy is consistent 
with the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and 
provides guidance about what constitutes a bribe, and prohibits giving 
or receiving any excessive or improper gifts and hospitality. Any policy 
breaches can lead to dismissal or termination of contract. 
Click to read our Code of Conduct:  
vodafone.com/code-of-conduct
Click to read more about our approach to Anti-bribery and corruption:  
vodafone.com/sustainable-business/operating-responsibly
Facilitation payments are strictly prohibited, and our employees are 
provided with training and guidance on how to respond to demands for 
facilitation payments. The only exception is when an employee’s personal 
safety is at risk. In such circumstances, when a payment under duress 
is made, the incident must be reported as soon as possible afterwards. 
We regularly monitor our anti-bribery programme to ensure it is 
implemented through conducting periodic monitoring activities, risk 
assessment, policy compliance reviews and internal audits. 
To support our approach, we are also a member of Transparency 
International UK’s Business Integrity Forum.

Assurance
Implementation of the anti-bribery policy is monitored regularly in 
all local markets as part of the annual Group assurance process, 
which reviews key anti-bribery controls. During FY24 we completed 
an on-site policy compliance review in Czech Republic. Further to this, 
in the DRC, Egypt, Greece, Tanzania, Turkey and Vodafone Group 
Services, selected key controls were evaluated to ensure their 
effective implementation. The annual assurance paper submitted to 
the Group Risk and Compliance Committee documents the key 
outcomes of these assurance activities and outlines the actions for 
the programme in the coming year. The results show that the 
anti-bribery programme has been well implemented and that the 
markets have strong controls in place to mitigate bribery risks. Some 
improvement areas were identified in third-party risk management, 
which remains a key focus area. Appropriate enhancement measures 
have been put in place. 
Fraud
Fraud is a growing threat globally, impacting our customers, 
reputation, and financial performance. The Executive Committee and 
the Audit and Risk Committee have recognised this through 
significant focus on the oversight of management capability 
development to mitigate the risk of fraud and protect our customers 
and employees. Vodafone delivers fraud management through a 
global organisation and operating model, utilising a combination of 
global (Fraud Centre of Excellence), central (_VOIS) and local 
(dedicated fraud team in each local market and for Group entities) 
resource. This blend of resources allows us to provide timely, 
effective, localised responses to any incidences of fraud, whilst also 
ensuring that any intelligence and best practice that may benefit the 
wider organisation is curated and shared. We continuously evolve our 
fraud technology and ways of working, adapting to the tactics used by 
fraudsters, and also aligning with key partner teams such as cyber 
security to leverage our respective strengths and establish a robust, 
layered defence. The protection of customers and support for victims 
of fraud are paramount in our global fraud strategy. We are working to 
enhance our capability in these regards through a combination of 
technical solutions, operational processes and raising awareness. 
Purpose (continued)
Risk
Response
Operating in 
high-risk markets
We undertake biennial risk assessments in each of our local operating companies and at Group level, so we can 
understand and limit our exposure to risk. 
Business acquisition 
and integration
Proportionate anti-bribery pre- and post acquisition due diligence are carried out on a target company. Red flags 
identified during the due diligence process are reviewed and assessed. Following acquisition, we implement our 
anti-bribery programme. 
Spectrum licensing
To reduce the risk of attempted bribery, a specialist spectrum policy team oversees our participation in all negotiations 
and auctions. We provide appropriate training and guidance for employees who interact with government officials on 
spectrum matters. 
Building and 
upgrading networks
Our anti-bribery policy makes it clear that we never offer any form of inducement to secure a permit, lease or access 
to a site. We regularly remind all employees in network roles of this prohibition, through tailored training sessions 
and communications. 
Working with  
third parties
Third-party due diligence is completed at the start of our business relationship with suppliers, other third parties and 
partners. Through their contracts with us, our suppliers, partners and other third parties make a commitment to 
implement and maintain proportionate and effective anti-bribery compliance measures.
We regularly remind current suppliers of our policy requirements and complete detailed compliance assessments 
across a sample of higher-risk and higher-value suppliers. Selected high-risk third parties are trained to ensure 
awareness of our zero-tolerance policy. 
Winning and 
retaining business
We provide tailored training for our Vodafone Business and Partner Markets sales teams. In addition, we also maintain 
and monitor an online register of gifts and hospitality to ensure that inappropriate offers are not accepted or extended 
by our employees. 
Governance and risk assessment
Our Group Chief Executive and Executive Committee oversee 
our efforts to prevent bribery. They are supported by local market 
chief executive officers, who are responsible for ensuring that our 
anti-bribery programme is implemented effectively in their local 
market. They in turn are supported by local specialists and by a 
dedicated Group team that is solely focused on anti-bribery policy 
and compliance. The Group Risk and Compliance Committee assists 
the Executive Committee in fulfilling duties with regard to risk 
management and policy compliance.
As part of our anti-bribery programme, every Vodafone business must 
adhere to minimum global standards, which include:
 – Ensuring there is a due diligence process for suppliers and business 
partners at the start of the business relationship;
 – Completion of the global e-learning training for all employees, as 
well as tailored training for higher risk teams; and
 – Using Vodafone’s online gifts and hospitality registration platform, 
as well as ensuring there is a process for approving local 
sponsorships and charitable contributions.
The risks we face evolve constantly but broadly fall into the areas 
summarised in the table below, which outlines the principal risk 
categories and the mitigation measures adopted.
Engaging employees to raise awareness of bribery risk
We run a multi-channel high-profile global communications 
programme, ‘Doing What’s Right’ (‘DWR’) to engage with employees 
and raise awareness and understanding of the policy. The DWR 
programme features e-learning training, including a specific 
anti-bribery module. Of those employees (including management) 
assigned training during the period, 96% had completed the training 
as at 31 March 2024. For higher-risk employees, additional tailored 
training programmes are used to cover scenarios relevant for those 
employees. We also conduct internal communication campaigns 
using a range of materials to highlight some of the key messages 
around zero tolerance of bribery and corruption, including 
communications from senior management.

ESG cautionary statement
In preparing the ESG-related information contained in this document, we have made a number of key judgements, estimations and assumptions. 
The processes, methodologies and issues involved in preparing this information are complex. The ESG data, models and methodologies used are 
often relatively new, are rapidly evolving and are not necessarily of the same standard as those available in the context of financial and other 
information, nor are they subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted 
accounting principles. It is not possible to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories in the case of climate change and its 
evolution. Outputs of models, processed data and methodologies may be affected by underlying data quality, which can be hard to assess, and we 
expect industry guidance, standards, market practice and regulations in this field to continue to evolve. There are also challenges faced in relation 
to the ability to access certain data on a timely basis and the lack of consistency and comparability between data that is available. This means the 
ESG-related forward-looking statements, information and targets discussed in this document carry an additional degree of inherent risk and uncertainty.

We face multiple risks and uncertainties that could 
affect the success of our business. We mitigate 
these risks through a robust risk management 
framework and by integrating risk management 
into our daily operations and culture.
Governance and identifying our risks
The Audit and Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews and 
challenges the principal and emerging risks as well as advises on the 
level of risk the Company is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
goals. The Board approves Vodafone’s strategy and aligns the risk 
management approach with it. The risk function aims to make risk 
considerations an integral part of executing our strategy, enabling 
informed decision-making across all our markets.
Our risk management approach is end-to-end, starting with local 
markets and Group entities identifying and evaluating risks to their 
local strategy. The Group risk team centrally assesses and challenges 
these risks. A comprehensive list of risks, along with external risk 
scanning findings, is presented to the Directors and executives for 
analysis and identification of significant risks. The proposed principal 
(pages 58 to 61), watchlist, and emerging (page 62) risks are agreed 
by our Executive Committee (‘ExCo’) before being submitted to the 
Audit and Risk Committee and the Board for review and approval.
Managing our risks
It is important to establish the context and understand the 
environment in which we operate. We categorise our risks into 
different risk types (strategic, operational, or financial) and identify 
whether the source of the threat is internal or external. This helps us 
effectively treat risks and provide appropriate oversight and 
assurance. 
Executive risk owners have the responsibility to put in place adequate 
controls and necessary treatment plans to bring risks within 
acceptable tolerance levels. Additionally, risk treatment plans and the 
effectiveness of our current controls are monitored through in-depth 
risk reviews, which are presented to relevant oversight committees.
Read more about the Audit and Risk Committee 
on pages 89 to 94
For each principal risk, we develop severe but plausible scenarios to 
understand the impact if it were to materialise. These scenarios 
provide additional insights into possible threats and improve the 
treatment strategy. They are also used to assess our viability.

Risk management (continued)
Description
Adverse changes to economic conditions 
could result in reduced customer spending, 
higher interest rates, adverse inflation, or 
adverse foreign exchange rates. Adverse 
conditions could also lead to limited debt 
refinancing options and/or increase in costs.
Risk ranking

Scenario
A severe contraction in economic activity 
leads to lower cash flow generation for the 
Group and disruption in global financial 
markets, which impacts our ability to 
refinance debt obligations as they fall due in 
a cost-effective manner.
Emerging factors
Because this is an externally driven risk, the 
threat environment is continually changing. 
External factors such as the conflicts in the 
Middle East, the ongoing war in Ukraine and 
uncertainty around the future path of 
monetary and fiscal policies could have 
impacts on economic activity across our 
markets. The financial markets are 
experiencing high levels of volatility, with 
sovereign debt at record levels. These 
factors could lead to a significant change in 
the availability and cost of capital.
Mitigation activities
We have a relatively resilient business 
model. We continue to keep a close eye on 
the possibility of recessions, which could 
manifest differently across our various 
jurisdictions. For our consumers who might 
be affected by an economic downturn, we 
offer competitive options and social plans 
and tariffs in the markets in which we 
operate. We have a long average life of debt, 
which reduces refinancing requirements, 
and all of our bond debt is effectively held at 
fixed interest rates.

Adverse market competition
Adverse political and policy 
environment 
Company transformation 
Description
Increasing competition could lead to price 
wars, reduced margins, loss of market share 
and/or damage to market value.
Description
Adverse political and policy measures 
impacting our strategy could result in 
increased costs, create a competitive 
disadvantage, or have a negative impact on 
our return on capital employed.
Description
Failure to effectively and successfully 
transform Vodafone to adapt to future 
challenges and demands could result in 
outdated business models, increased 
operational complexity, and hinder growth.
Scenario
Aggressive pricing, accelerated customer 
losses to low-value players on mobile and 
fixed, and disruptive new market entrants in 
key European markets could result in 
greater customer churn and pricing 
pressures, impacting our financial position. 
Emerging factors
Emerging factors often depend on individual 
market structures and the competitive 
landscape. External factors such as local and 
macroeconomic pressures, may impact 
household and individual connectivity 
spend. In addition, continued aggressive 
penetration pricing by disruptive low-price 
players across markets on both mobile and 
fixed could accelerate customer losses and 
drive prices down in markets.
Mitigation activities
We closely monitor the competitive 
environment in all markets and react 
accordingly to both consumer and business 
needs. We have initiated Group-wide 
programmes to focus on the customers 
which is one of our strategic priorities. We 
keep investing in our brand and 
differentiated customer experience, and we 
design propositions with additional benefits, 
such as flexible device financing, integrated 
trade-in, refurbished devices, and social 
tariffs. In addition, in many markets we utilise 
‘second’ brands to compete more effectively 
and efficiently in the value segment.
Scenario
Uncertainty in and the growing complexity 
of the global and national political 
environments may lead to unexpected 
political or regulatory interventions that 
would adversely affect our operations. 
Emerging factors
Geopolitical tensions and ongoing conflicts 
amplify the risk of government intervention, 
which may include both protectionist 
interventions and security-related 
requirements. These could affect our 
operations, supply chains and conditions for 
competition in various ways. The increasing 
breadth and depth of external geopolitical 
challenges means there is a continuous 
need to adapt to effectively mitigate the 
changing risk environment. Heightened 
uncertainty from elections in 2024 and the 
proliferation of emerging technologies also 
contribute to this risk.
Mitigation activities
We actively monitor the external horizon, 
gather intelligence to inform decision-
making and proactively engage with 
policymakers, regulatory authorities, 
customers and relevant stakeholders to find 
mutually acceptable ways forward. As a last 
resort, we uphold our rights through legal 
means.
Scenario
Changes to drive organisational simplicity 
could result in lower employee 
engagement, higher talent attrition, and 
failure to become a more efficient 
organisation. 
Emerging factors
The scale and increasing volume of internal 
change being undertaken may put 
additional strain on our people and culture 
causing fatigue and/or disengagement. This 
could result in a failure to deliver with the 
focus and operational excellence required to 
drive success from these transformations. 
Additionally, the commercialisation of our 
shared operation capabilities to both internal 
and external customers, could increase the 
complexity of service line pricing and 
internal pricing models.
Mitigation activities
We have governance structures in place, 
sponsored by the ExCo, to align on potential 
changes. These structures consider 
implications, risks and mitigating actions 
across all relevant dimensions. Specialist 
teams manage our company transformation 
agenda. Leadership lab programmes are in 
place to deliver the cultural shift needed to 
deliver these programmes.

Cyber threat
Disintermediation 
Data management and privacy
Description
Failure to effectively respond to threats from 
emerging technology or disruptive business 
models could lead to a loss of customer 
relevance, market share and new/existing 
revenue streams.
Description
An external cyber attack, insider threat or 
supplier breach could cause service 
interruption or data breach.
Description
Data breaches, misuse of data, data 
manipulation, inappropriate data sharing, 
poor data quality or data unavailability could 
lead to fines, reputational damage, loss of 
value, loss of business opportunity, and 
failure to meet customer expectations.

Scenario
Threat actors could use destructive malware 
against core infrastructure to disable our 
ability to serve customers, causing customer 
dissatisfaction and loss of revenue.
Emerging factors
Cyber risk is constantly evolving and is 
influenced by economic, technological and 
geopolitical developments. We anticipate 
threats will continue from existing sources 
as well as evolving ones based on new 
technologies such as artificial intelligence 
(‘AI’) and quantum computing.
Mitigation activities
Our cyber security strategy has a risk and 
control framework to manage cyber risk to 
our networks and services. Our controls 
identify, protect against, detect, respond to, 
and recover from threats. We measure the 
control baseline across all parts of the 
Company and have an in-house team of 
experts in cyber security. We embed security 
by design into our products, services and 
internal operations. Protective controls 
mitigate the effect of most threats; however, 
when attacks are successful we focus on 
rapid response to minimise business and 
customer impact. Root cause analysis 
provides continuous improvement and 
drives action.

security in our fact sheet: investors.vodafone.

Scenario
Failure to manage the privacy of our 
stakeholders’ data effectively and 
compliantly could result in regulatory fines, 
paying significant damages to impacted 
individuals, and also reputational damage 
that could result in higher customer churn 
rates.
Emerging factors
The proliferation of AI and related regulatory 
and legislative action across our footprint 
requires a robust ethics and compliance 
approach. Geopoliticisation of data will 
continue to negatively impact cross-border 
data transfers. New European data 
regulations, such as the Artificial Intelligence 
Act or the Cyber Act, will introduce 
significant new legal requirements around 
data management of our business activities.
Mitigation activities
Our data and privacy strategies are designed 
to continually reduce the risks. We regularly 
conduct reviews of our significant privacy 
and data risks. We use the outcomes to 
prevent, detect and respond to the risks on a 
prioritised basis. When incidents do occur, 
we identify the root causes and use them to 
improve our controls.
Read more about our approach to data management 
and privacy on pages 45 and 46
Scenario
Increasing ‘softwareisation’ of connectivity 
services combined with the growing 
ecosystem power of Big Tech companies 
could see the emergence of competitors 
and distribution channels with the potential 
to disintermediate our customer 
relationships.
Emerging factors
In our consumer business, alternative 
technology solutions may enable new 
intermediaries to sell communication 
propositions, while our TV customers may 
switch to ‘over-the-top’ video-on-demand 
services. In our corporate business, the 
‘softwareisation’ of services may enable new 
competitors in the value chain. In our 
infrastructure markets, supplier 
concentration within the satellite 
connectivity market and hyperscaler 
investment in orchestration and network 
capabilities may present future additional 
challenges.
Mitigation activities
Our increasingly deep partnerships with big 
technology players and the potential to 
leverage the new Digital Markets Act have 
improved our ability to defend against the 
customer ownership risks. In addition, we 
continue to focus intensively on improving 
our customers’ experience, strengthening 
our propositions and bundling digital 
services for consumer and business markets 
to enhance customer loyalty.

Scenario
Regulations imposed delays or disruptive 
remedies for in-market consolidation.  
We are adversely impacted by market 
remedies imposed by regulators following 
in-market consolidation. Additionally, 
we may face unforeseen challenges in 
driving synergy benefits.
Emerging factors
Adverse change in the regulators’ approach 
to in-market consolidation may limit 
opportunities for value-accretive market 
structures. Additionally, our internal 
capability and skill sets may not align with 
the needs of our portfolio structure as we 
increase our focus on JVs and investments.
Mitigation activities
We will continue to mitigate the risk in 
transaction execution by conducting broad 
stakeholder engagement and having 
dedicated teams working on any transition 
and future services arrangements.
We have reviewed a number of our 
investment governance mechanisms and 
where needed enhancements have been 
made. In our JV governance and ways of 
working policy, we outline the principles for 
the shareholder agreement and corporate 
governance. This includes how we engage 
with the individual entities. Furthermore, we 
now have a dedicated ExCo member and 
team with responsibility to maximise the 
opportunities and minimise the risk.
Scenario
Political decisions affecting our ability to use 
equipment from specific vendors could 
cause trade and supply chain disruptions.
Emerging factors
Changes in the political landscape outside 
Vodafone’s control may significantly impact 
the upgrade and maintenance of our 
network. For example, US and China 
tensions resulting in a ban of high-risk 
vendors, long-term impacts from the war in 
Ukraine, or potential open conflict between 
China and Taiwan could impact product 
availability. Disruption may lead to an 
increase in our costs in areas such as raw 
materials, energy, and shipping, while at the 
same time triggering shortages or extended 
lead times for critical components. 
Mitigation activities
We are closely monitoring the evolution of 
the geopolitical environment. This enables 
us to respond to emerging challenges and 
to comply with regulations, economic 
sanctions and trade rulings. We also mitigate 
our exposure through having multi-year 
contracts with key suppliers, forecasting and 
forward-ordering our inventory 
requirements in anticipation of extended 
lead times and continuing to execute our 
optimisation strategy for network 
infrastructure logistics.
Scenario
A major outage in a critical data centre or a 
failed IT transformation activity could reduce 
service to customers, affecting revenue and 
reputation.
Emerging factors
Like most mature companies, we continue 
to proactively manage our systems life 
cycle. We closely monitor our technology 
landscape for additional systems nearing 
end of life and have associated plans to 
mitigate or replace. Another emerging factor 
is the inability to deliver large IT 
transformations at the forecasted pace 
because of changes in macroeconomic 
conditions, market pressures, and evolving 
customer expectations. Additionally, 
extreme weather events, and deliberate 
attacks on national critical infrastructure in 
times of war or instability, could also 
heighten the risk of technology failure.
Mitigation activities
To reduce the impact of service disruptions, 
we establish recovery goals for critical 
assets. A global policy outlines the key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) necessary to 
guarantee the resilience and security of 
technology services. We prioritise IT 
transformation and modernisation 
programmes, such as the Oracle Cloud 
Infrastructure, SAP RISE, and the recent 
Azure cloud agreement with Microsoft, to 
address specific technology resilience risks, 
while streamlining business processes and 
simplifying the portfolio. In addition, IT 
transformation programmes carry risks of 
scope creep and cost overruns; therefore, 
we are increasingly using an incremental 
delivery approach to be able to achieve 
benefits and adapt quickly, while 
maintaining strict governance.

Watchlist risks
Our watchlist risk process enables us to monitor material risks to 
Vodafone Group that fall outside our principal risks. These include, 
but are not limited to:
Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) 
Failure to prioritise ESG considerations may result in reputational 
damage. Negative publicity related to environmental harm, social 
issues, or governance failures can lead to loss of trust amongst 
customers, investors and the broader public.

Product innovation
Failure to create and deliver new products and service categories that 
diversify revenue growth, unlock new consumer engagement and 
mitigate disruption from digital natives.
Legal compliance
Non-compliance with laws and regulations including anti-bribery, 
competition law, anti-money laundering, trade controls and sanctions, 
potentially leading to fines and reputational risk.

investors.vodafone.com/vtbriefing
Emerging risks
We face a number of uncertainties where an emerging risk may 
potentially impact us. In general, we encounter three types of 
emerging risks. The first type is a new risk in a known context, where it 
emerges from the external environment and can impact the 
organisation’s activities. An example of this is the potential impact of 
conflict in the Middle East. The second type is a known risk in a new 
context, such as the need for new skills and talent to support future 
services. The third type is a new risk in a new context, such as the 
impact of the commercial space age.
We continue to identify new emerging risk trends, using inputs from 
analysis of the external environment and internal sources. We 
evaluate our risks across different time periods, allowing us to provide 
the appropriate level of focus on these emerging risks. We categorise 
our emerging risk into five different categories: technological, 
political/regulatory, economic, societal and business environment, so 
that the relevant expertise across the business can assess the 
potential impacts and time horizon of these risks.
In some cases, there may be insufficient information to fully analyse 
and understand the likelihood, impact or velocity of the risk. As a 
result, we may not be able to develop a complete mitigation plan 
until we have a better understanding of the threat.
Our emerging risks, within predefined risk categories, are provided to 
the ExCo and the Audit and Risk Committee for further scrutiny.
Building strong foundations
We continue to enhance and embed the global risk management 
framework with the objective of maturing our approach. This 
promotes consistency across all the markets in which we operate.
Over the course of the year under review, we have:
 – Enhanced our risk tooling and methodology to establish a more 
straightforward process for documenting and reporting risks from 
our local markets;
 – Carried out an evaluation to gain a deeper insight into the physical 
and transition risks associated with climate change;
 – Improved the process of linking risk and mitigation actions to 
the budget to improve risk decisions on the risk treatment strategy; 
 – Following the risk awareness campaign in the previous year, 
conducted a risk culture survey with the Group Senior Leadership 
Team (‘SLT’) to gather insights into their understanding of the risk 
management practices; and
 – Conducted an external review to benchmark and evaluate the 
maturity of our risk framework and process.
Key changes to our principal risks:
 – The risk of Supply chain disruption has increased due to 
political uncertainty related to the use of high-risk vendors in 
our European markets.
 – The risk of Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions 
has decreased as we see an easing in the external economic 
outlook. Additionally, over the past year we have implemented 
controls, such as hedging for inflation and energy costs to 
manage the impact of the risk. 
 – The Company transformation risk has been broadened to 
encompass organisational simplification and other large 
non-portfolio transformation projects.
 – The scope of the Technology resilience and future 
readiness risk has been expanded to include the sub-risk 
end-of-service-life and legacy infrastructure, as our technology 
environment is ever-expanding, and we see an increasing 
number of assets nearing their end of life in this assessment 
period.
 – The strategic transformation risk was refocused on Portfolio 
transformation and governance of investments. As a result, 
the sub-risk of product innovation has been moved across to 
the watchlist risks, as detailed in the section below.

The preparation of the LTVS includes an assessment of the Group’s 
long-term prospects in addition to an assessment of its ability to 
meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the 
three-year review period.
Assessment of viability
The Board has chosen a three-year period to assess Vodafone 
Group’s viability. This is the period in which we believe our principal 
risks tend to develop. This time horizon is also in line with the 
structure of long-term management incentives and the outputs from 
the long-range business-planning cycle. We continue to conduct 
financial stress testing and sensitivity analysis, considering revenue 
at risk.
The viability assessment started with the available headroom as of 31 
March 2024 and considered the plans and projections assembled 
as part of the forecasting cycle, which include the Group’s cash flow, 
planned commitments, required funding, and other key financial 
ratios. We also assumed that debt refinancing will remain available in 
all plausible market conditions.
Finally, we estimated the impact of severe but plausible scenarios for 
our principal risks on the three-year plan. We also stress-tested a 
combined scenario taking into account the risk interdependencies as 
defined in the table on page 58, where the following risks were 
modelled as materialising in parallel over the three-year period:
Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions: Adverse 
changes in the macroeconomic environment could result in 
restricted ability to refinance, while prolonged high inflation rates, 
may lead to increased interest rates.
Cyber threat: A cyber-attack may exploit vulnerabilities, allowing 
unauthorised access to IT and network systems, leading to a breach 
of information and a potential GDPR fine.
Supply chain disruption: Tensions between the US and China are 
uncertain, leading to increased volatility in the geopolitical 
landscape. This has the potential to influence political decisions, 
which could impact our ability to use equipment from certain 
vendors.
Long-term viability statement (‘LTVS’) 
Legal: Legal disputes and adverse judgements against the company 
resulting in significant financial liabilities, including increased fines, 
penalties, or compensatory payments.
Assessment of long-term prospects
The Board undertakes a robust review and challenge of the strategy 
and assumptions. Each year the Board conducts a strategy session, 
reviewing the internal and external environment as well as significant 
threats and opportunities to the sustainable creation of long-term 
shareholder value (note that known emerging factors related to each 
principal risk are described on pages 58 to 61).
As an input to the strategy discussion, the Board considers the key 
risks (including Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, 
Cyber threat, Supply chain disruption, and Legal) with the focus 
on identifying underlying opportunities and setting the Group’s 
future strategy. The output from this session is reflected in the 
strategic section of the Annual Report (page 9), which provides a 
view of the Group’s long-term prospects.
Conclusions
The Board assessed the prospects and viability of the Group in 
accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
considering the Group’s strategy and business model, and 
the principal risks to the Group’s future performance, solvency, 
liquidity and reputation. The assessment took into account possible 
mitigating actions available to management were any 
risk or combination of risks to materialise.
Cash and cash equivalents available of €6.1 billion (page 186) at 
31 March 2024, along with options available to reduce cash 
outgoings over the period considered, provide the Group with 
sufficient positive headroom in all scenarios tested. Reverse stress 
testing on revenue and adjusted EBITDAaL over the review period 
confirmed that the Group has sufficient headroom available to face 
uncertainty. The Board deemed the stress test conducted to be 
adequate, and therefore confirmed that it has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will remain in operation and be able to 
meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 March 2027.

Climate-related risk 
We recognise that both physical changes to the 
climate and the transition to a lower carbon 
economy pose risks and opportunities for our 
business. This section outlines our approach to 
governance, strategy, risk management, metrics 
and targets in relation to these climate-related risks 
and opportunities. 
Our disclosure of climate-related risks is well established. We 
conducted our first climate-related risk assessment in 2019, and have 
published a standalone report annually since 2021 – applying the 
framework of recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’). From this year, following the 
incorporation of the TCFD framework into the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), we include our climate-related risk 
reporting here, within our Annual Report. We see this as the next 
milestone in our journey to integrate the management and disclosure 
of climate-related risk into our core business processes. 
We continue to report in line with the TCFD framework and its 11 
recommendations. This year, we have also prepared this report with 
reference to the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures standard, in 
preparation for aligning with this in the future. 
Governance
Climate-related risks are integrated into our risk management 
framework and the Audit and Risk Committee (‘ARC’) executes 
responsibility for these risks on behalf of the Board. Vodafone’s 
proposed principal risks, watchlist risks and emerging risks are 
reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee (‘ExCo’) annually 
before being submitted to the ARC and the Board. During FY24, 
climate change (which was previously a distinct risk on our watchlist), 
was consolidated as a sub-risk of Environmental, Social and 
Governance (‘ESG’). This broader ESG risk will be monitored on our 
watchlist and reported through our risk governance structure. 
 Read more about our risk  
governance structure on page 57
 Read more about watchlist risks  
on page 62
Our climate-related risk and resilience programme sits within the 
Protecting the Planet part of our Purpose strategy, which is ultimately 
overseen and approved by the ESG Committee. The Committee’s 
responsibility is to oversee Vodafone’s response to climate change, as 
part of our Purpose strategy. The committee meets at least twice per 
year to provide direction on the management of risks and 
opportunities to Vodafone’s operations and reputation. 
At Executive Committee (‘ExCo’) level, the ESG and Reputation 
Steering Committee (‘ESGR’) is accountable for the implementation of 
the Purpose strategy, and has appointed an Executive sponsor (the 
Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer) to oversee the 
implementation of the Protecting the Planet pillar of the strategy. The 
Committee reviews progress of delivery of the Protecting the Planet 
strategy quarterly, including the assessment and management of 
climate-related risks and opportunities. The ESGR reports half-yearly 
to the ESG Committee on the status of the Protecting the Planet 
strategy, its implementation and progress against targets to support 
the Board’s oversight of the management of climate-related risks. 
Each year, the ARC and ESG committees meet to jointly review and 
provide oversight for the annual climate-related risk disclosure.

At operational level, the Group Head of Risk coordinates the annual 
programme to identify and assess climate-related risk, with support from 
the Head of Sustainable Business. Progress against the annual risk 
identification and assessment programme is monitored through the ESGR. 
Actions to strengthen our climate resilience and mitigate climate-
related risks were included in our Vodafone Group Climate Transition 
Plan (‘CTP’). Accountability for the design and implementation of 
these actions and initiatives is assigned to individual senior managers, 
within a range of relevant business functions across Vodafone’s global 
business including our networks and technology operations, 
commercial and enterprise business units, procurement, external 
affairs and property teams.

The implementation of the transition plan is also overseen by the 
ESGR. Accountable delivery functions report quarterly to the ESGR, 
including raising any risks to the delivery of the plan. As a cross-
functional strategic programme, business functions accountable for 
the delivery of the transition plan include procurement, commercial, 
brand and marketing, networks and technology, enterprise, products 
and services, amongst others.
The ESGR identifies any significant business decisions (for example, 
major transactions or changes to business strategy) that could impact 
Vodafone’s climate resilience or change the severity or likelihood of 
climate-related risks. Any risks or issues identified are evaluated by 
the risk and sustainable business teams, and if necessary escalated 
through the Protecting the Planet and Purpose governance structure 
to the ESGR. 
We have an internal global policy, owned by the Chief External and 
Corporate Affairs Officer, to establish the minimum requirements for 
environmental management. All Vodafone entities within the Group’s 
operational control (including within Vodacom) are required to 
adhere to this policy. The policy includes requirements to annually 
review climate-related risks and opportunities within the context of 
each market we operate in, and incorporate any significant findings 
into our overall Group-level climate-related risk assessment. The 
policy also includes requirements to implement the CTP, which 
assigns responsibility for taking climate action and building climate 
resilience, in line with our strategy, to management across our global 
business.

Strategy
For FY24, our climate-related risk assessment builds upon our 
previous analyses, including our quantitative scenario analysis of 
physical climate risk in Europe and Vodacom’s assessment of 
climate-related risks in Africa. We also conducted a review of 
transition risks, which involved desk-based research, internal 
stakeholder interviews and a qualitative scenarios analysis, applying 
time horizons consistent with our physical risk analysis. 
Overall, this year’s risk assessment has led to a refreshed list of our 
priority climate-related risks and opportunities.

on page 66
Our priority climate-related risks and opportunities1
Physical risks 
(1) Extreme weather: Damage to assets or disruption to our own 
operations or supply chain due to extreme weather events such as 
storms and cyclones, flooding and wildfires. Our network 
infrastructure assets are already being affected by extreme 
weather (e.g. flooding in Germany, wildfires in Greece, cyclones in 
Mozambique), although currently at a scale that can be managed 
to avoid major operational impact, asset impairment or cost. 
Longer term, in combination with geopolitical risks, extreme 
weather could disrupt supply chains, particularly those that 
depend on critical regions (such as China for electronic 
components) or locations (such as coastal ports).
Time horizon: Medium term
(2) Rising average temperatures: Rising average temperatures 
could damage network equipment and other above-ground 
infrastructure or cause operational failure (particularly if located in 
exposed outdoor locations, e.g. radio towers), as well as cause 
disruption in our supply chain. It could also lead to increasing 
consumption of energy for cooling infrastructure, data centres and 
offices, which could increase operating costs. We expect this risk 
to materialise in the medium term, with the most severe impacts in 
the ‘business as usual’ scenario. Higher frequency of hot days is 
likely to be more pronounced in our southern European markets 
(such as Greece and Portugal) and in African markets. 
Time horizon: Medium term
Transition risks  
(3) Energy costs: Increasingly volatile energy prices and overall 
higher energy costs, partially driven by carbon pricing and demand 
for renewable electricity certificates outstripping supply. This risk 
is particularly prevalent in markets with high dependency on fossil 
fuels (e.g. to operate diesel generators) and non-renewable energy. 
However, carbon pricing will also drive an increase in cost to procure 
carbon-intensive products and raw materials, as third parties 
upstream in the supply chain look to pass through higher costs. 
Time horizon: Short term
(4) Regulatory compliance costs: As governments introduce 
policies to support the climate transition, these could impact our 
product portfolio (such as energy use of fixed line or mobile 
devices), operations (such as data centres) or corporate 
sustainability reporting and disclosures. Over the medium term, as 
these are transposed into law in each of our markets, this could 
result in a cost to comply or a financial risk from non-compliance. 
Time horizon: Medium term
(5) Expectations of business customers: Loss of market share if 
climate performance continues to be a differentiator during 
supplier selection by business customers, and Vodafone does not 
keep pace with the low carbon products and services offered by 
competitors, or rising business customer expectations for adhering 
to climate-related requirements. 
Time horizon: Medium term
(6) Greenwashing risk: Misleading claims about the environmental 
impact of Vodafone (at a corporate reporting or brand communications 
level) or its products and services (at a product marketing level) could 
result in reputation damage, loss of revenues or possibly legal costs. 
Time horizon: Medium term
Transition opportunity 
(7) Customer enablement: Revenue growth from the design and 
deployment of green digital solutions that enable business 
customers to reduce their own GHG emissions, as they seek 
technology solutions to support their own climate transition.
Time horizon: Medium term
Note: 
1. As described in the Risk Management section of this report, these climate-related risks 
and opportunities have been prioritised based on their potential severity, likelihood and 
time horizon relative to the full range of climate-related risks and opportunities identified 
through our risk analyses. Their prioritisation does not indicate the significance of the risk 
or opportunity relative to other risk categories, nor does it indicate the significance of any 
impact on Vodafone’s financial position. We therefore refer to these as our ’priority’, 
rather than ‘material’ risks.

scenario analysis (2024)
Early policy action (<2°C) 
In the early policy action scenario, we foresee that physical risks 
increase but remain broadly manageable within the operating 
boundaries of our current business model and network infrastructure 
(which has already built in a level of climate resilience), and with 
limited or minor cost incurred. Our analysis indicates that in Europe a 
relatively small proportion (6.6%) of our network assets could be at 
high or very high risk of damage from climate perils that could incur 
more significant cost. Transition risks, if left unmitigated, could 
materialise into business impacts within the short to medium term 
(within the next five years), potentially incurring increased operating 
costs, costs to comply with regulation, loss of revenue from business 
customers and reputational damage. However, the severity of these 
impacts is unlikely to be financially material. The potential 
commercial value creation from capturing the growing market for 
green digital solutions is greatest in this scenario, as industries seek to 
decarbonise in response to policy and market incentives. 
Late policy action (<2.5°C)
In the late policy action scenario, we can expect physical impacts of 
climate change to be more severe and frequent, incurring higher 
costs and disruption to operations and supply chains. Some transition 
risks would materialise, for the most part within the medium term, in 
relation to increasing regulatory and compliance costs and increasing 
expectations from business customers for sustainable products and 
services.
No policy action (<4°C)
In the no policy action scenario, our exposure to physical risks in 
Europe increases marginally, with an estimated 7.0% of our network 
assets at high or very high risk of damage from climate perils such as 
storms and heavy precipitation, which could cause damage to our 
network assets or operational disruption. The exposure of our own 
operations to physical risks could be more severe in Africa, where 
temperature increases could be 1.5 to 2 times the average global 
temperature increase. This scenario also results in the greatest 
physical climate change impacts for our supply chains, which could 
result in increased cost or supply chain disruption (particularly where 
the production of goods is concentrated in geographies vulnerable to 
climate change). Transition risks are lowest in this scenario. There may 
be market growth opportunities in this scenario as customers seek 
technology solutions to help adapt to physical changes in the climate.
Building climate resilience into our business strategy
As a fixed and mobile network operator, we have a large number of 
assets and infrastructure spread over a wide geographical area in all 
of the markets in which we operate. This means that our business is 
exposed to climate change impacts and transition risks across Europe 
and Africa. 
However, our analysis indicates that Vodafone’s underlying business 
model is relatively resilient to climate-related risk. Vodafone’s physical 
risk exposure is not expected to result in significant cost or asset 
impairment, with a relatively limited range of impacts expected across 
the range of scenarios analysed, particularly in Europe. This is partly 
due to the level of resilience that is already built into our network 
infrastructure and because the majority of our assets (such as radio 
equipment) are relatively short-lived with opportunity to adapt our 
network as part of our routine end-of-life equipment replacement 
programme. However, more widespread operational disruption (within 
both our own operations and in our value chain) due to extreme 
weather events and extreme heat can be expected over the medium 
to long term in the no policy action scenario, particularly in Africa. 
Across the scenarios, transition risks are unlikely to result in financially 
material impacts. We intend to undertake further quantitative scenario 
analysis of our highest priority transition risks to reinforce these 
conclusions.

Currently, Vodafone has insurance arrangements in place to cover 
loss or damage to assets from a range of natural disasters and 
weather-related events such as flooding, fires and storms (although 
the policies do not specifically refer to these as climate-related 
events). In recent years, we note that insurance claims have been 
made to cover damage to infrastructure. For example, in relation to 
flooding in Germany and wildfires in Greece and Portugal, these 
claims relate mostly to damage to our mobile access base station 
network, rather than our higher value assets, such as data or 
technology centres, and are not considered to be financially material 
at this stage. Based on our analyses to date, we have not identified 
any material financial risks relating to the cost or availability of 
insurance as a result of climate change.
There are opportunities for value creation across the range of 
scenarios. In both the early and late policy action scenarios, there is 
potential for commercial growth from the sale of digital solutions that 
can help our customers to decarbonise their businesses. Whereas the 
no policy action scenario presents growth opportunities from sale of 
digital solutions that help our customers adapt to more extreme 
physical changes in the climate. 
Our CTP incorporates the management actions required to build 
resilience into our business in response to Vodafone’s priority 
climate-related risks and opportunities. Our latest analysis, outlined in 
this report, has informed the transition plan activities that have been 
integrated into our long-range business and financial planning cycle. 
Governance and accountability have been put in place to monitor and 
manage the implementation of the transition plan.

Resilience to physical risks 
Protecting our infrastructure assets from being damaged or disrupted 
by climate-related weather events is central to the climate resilience 
of our business and network services. Mitigation measures are built 
into the key stages of each asset’s life cycle, from acquisition to 
maintenance, and cover climate adaptation as well as damage 
response. During the acquisition of assets, including buildings and 
network equipment, we have policies and guidance in place to 
incorporate the assessment of environmental risks. Our internal 
technology resilience policy requires each asset to conduct a physical 
risk assessment annually, which includes evaluating environmental 
risks. We also have reactive measures related to asset maintenance in 
place, such as processes and teams dedicated to disaster recovery 
and business continuity. Lastly, we have insurance policies designed 
to transfer any significant financial impact of physical risks, which 
cover claims on asset loss and damage. 
Building resilience into our operations and network infrastructure is a 
well-established part of our business-as-usual process, irrespective of 
whether climate change has been explicitly named as a primary risk 
driver. We intend to continue to build resilience to the physical risks of 
climate change and intend to integrate any additional high-priority 
climate adaptation actions beyond our current planning, 
procurement, network resilience and business continuity practices 
into our CTP over the coming year.
Resilience to transition risks 
Decarbonising our business model and improving energy efficiency 
will help to minimise our exposure to transition risks. We have set 
targets to reduce greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions from our own 
operations and to become net zero across our full value chain by 
2040 (including at least 90% absolute emission reduction, with any 
remaining emissions neutralised through high quality carbon 
offsetting). 
Read more about our Protect the Planet goals and strategy  
on pages 38 to 42
Our CTP includes workstreams on:
 – Climate-related policy – to formalise the role of our public 
affairs, legal and tax teams in identifying, monitoring and 
responding to the ever-evolving landscape of climate-related 
policy and regulation. 
 – Power purchase agreements – to limit exposure to energy 
price volatility by increasing the proportion of renewable 
electricity purchased through power purchase agreements 
(‘PPAs’) as part of our energy procurement strategy. 
 – Transition plan reporting – to manage our exposure to 
reputational risks such as greenwashing, by communicating 
clearly and transparently on our climate strategy and continuing 
to implement strong governance over the use of environmental 
claims in our brand, marketing and corporate communications. 
Realising opportunities
Our most significant climate-related opportunity relates to developing 
new product lines to enable our enterprise customers to reduce GHG 
emissions, improve resource efficiency and protect or enhance 
nature. This enablement effect is a key pillar of our Planet strategy.
Read more about our approach to enablement  
on page 41
Our CTP includes a workstream on ‘sustainability by design’. This is to 
develop and deploy more green digital solutions, such as IoT 
solutions for smart cities, buildings or lower-carbon transport and 
mobility, that can help our customers manage their environmental 
impact, whilst also minimising the negative environmental impact from 
the production of our products and services. 
Risk management 
The management of climate-related risks follows the process defined 
by our enterprise risk management framework, which is defined 
centrally and implemented in each of our markets. Our approach to 
climate-related risk assessment is outlined below. 
(1) Identify
To identify potential climate-related risks and opportunities, we review 
the relevant sources of information such as media articles, publications, 
industry peer disclosures and industry white papers, in addition to reviewing 
our previous years’ analyses. We engage with relevant internal and external 
experts to gather views on the evolving nature of climate-related risks 
for the telecommunications sector and examples of any climate 
change impacts that might already be materialising. 
(2) Measure
We assess the likelihood and severity of impact for each risk and 
opportunity identified. We simulate how the risks and opportunities 
could materialise over three time horizons, across a range of possible 
future scenarios. We review our scenarios analysis annually to reflect 
the most up-to-date information on climate-related trends. 
Read more about our definitions for scenarios and time horizons 
on page 66
In assessing the severity of an impact, we consider the relative extent 
of the potential financial impact through business value drivers such 
as increased costs, loss of revenue, asset impairment and damage to 
brand or corporate reputation. In assessing the likelihood of an impact, 
we consider the potential probability that it will materialise based on 
current trends, forecasts and projections and levels of uncertainty. 
We have conducted a quantitative scenarios analysis for physical risks 
in both Europe and Africa. For transition risks and opportunities, their 
severity and likelihood has been assessed qualitatively across our 
selected scenarios and time horizons. 
We are working towards estimating the financial value at stake from 
climate-related risks across our global business, which will depend 
upon the completion of a fully quantitative scenarios analysis for both 
physical and transition risks. We aim to complete this quantitative 
scenarios analysis (including transition risks) within the coming year.

Climate-related risk (continued) 
Our approach to climate-related risk assessment in Africa
Vodacom Group publishes a standalone report disclosing details 
of our climate-related risk and opportunity assessment for our 
markets in Africa. 
Click to read Vodacom Group’s latest TCFD report: 
vodacom.com/reporting-centre 
Our 2023 analysis confirmed that our markets in Africa will be 
exposed to increased occurrence and severity of extreme weather 
events – with impacts already being felt today. Climate perils 
include increasing temperatures, drought conditions and 
increased rainfall, storm surges and cyclonic activity. For example, 
in March 2023 Cyclone Freddy (one of the most powerful and 
longest-lasting cyclones that has impacted Mozambique since the 
beginning of 2022) impacted our operations, workforce and assets. 
Similarly, Vodacom’s climate-related risk and opportunity analysis 
confirms that our business will be affected by transition risks in relation 
to evolving stakeholder expectations, policies and market evolution. 
Our approach to physical risk assessment in Europe
This year, we completed a quantitative scenarios analysis of 
physical climate risks in Europe, which we commenced in 2022. 
Overall, this assessment involved screening over 650 assets across 
Spain, Italy, the UK, Germany and Greece, under both RCP 2.6 
(early policy action scenario) and RCP 8.5 (no policy action 
scenario), to identify assets at ‘high’ or ‘very high’ risk of damage.
We screened assets from three categories of our infrastructure 
asset portfolio, which are considered critical to our operations:
 – Low-rise structures such as offices and bunkers; 
 – Control room assets such as technical buildings, warehouses 
and data centres; and 
 – Station assets such as railway stations. 
The impact on the assets was assessed in relation to the following 
eight climate perils:
1. Coastal inundation
2. River flood
3. Surface-water flood
4. Extreme heat
5. Extreme wind
6. Wildfire
7. Freeze thaw
8. Drought-driven subsidence
The nature and likelihood of the impact of the climate perils was 
modelled at a granular resolution based on external climate data 
sets, overlaid with the geolocation of each asset.
The magnitude of the potential impacts was assessed based on 
the potential value at stake in terms of:
 – Damage ratio (average proportion of damage to an asset in a 
given year);
 – Expected cost of damage (financial cost of remedying damage 
sustained); and
 – Failure probability (annual probability of a climate hazard 
causing the asset to stop working).
Between 6.6% and 7.0% of analysed sites were identified as being 
at ‘high’ or ‘very high’ risk of damage from climate perils by 2050 
(rising to 7.2% to 8.1% by 2100), defined as: 
 – High: Expected cost of damage notable, with potential cost 
implications; and
 – Very high: Widespread damage/disruption.
The majority of value at stake resulting from climate perils across 
the asset portfolio is associated with the top 10 at-risk assets.
Five of the assets at ‘high’ or ‘very high’ risk were selected for a 
deep dive analysis of potential operational and financial impacts, 
to understand the potential drivers of financial loss and mitigation 
actions. The most significant drivers contributing to the expected 
cost of damage for these assets were coastal inundation and 
riverine flooding. By 2100, in the scenario with no policy action, all 
five sites were also expected to be at high risk of operational 
failure due to extreme heat events. 
Findings from our 2022 physical risk assessment were reinforced 
by an additional study of physical risks conducted during FY24 
with a particular focus on understanding implications for insurance 
of over 80 of our highest value assets. This year’s most recent 
study concurred with the findings of our 2022 physical risk 
assessment, highlighting the increased risk of flooding and 
heatwaves that could impact our operations in the long term. 
Our approach to transition risk assessment
In FY24, we conducted qualitative scenarios analysis of transition 
risks across our global business, including both Europe and Africa. 
Based on desk research, industry peer comparison and expert 
insights, we identified 67 risks and opportunities that could be 
relevant to Vodafone Group. We shortlisted 28 of these for further 
analysis based on a preliminary screening of their relative potential 
severity, likelihood and time horizon of impact. 
Using insights from internal engagement with cross-functional 
stakeholders, the shortlist was synthesised into seven priority risks 
and opportunities. Five of which are related to the low carbon 
transition, which we consider could reasonably be expected to 
affect Vodafone Group’s prospects. Looking across three future 
scenarios, we conducted a qualitative analysis of the most 
significant transition risks and opportunities. 
We mapped out impact pathways to understand how the 
climate-related transition risks could lead to outcomes and 
impacts on Vodafone and their potential to result in financial 
impact (for example, through asset impairment, increased costs or 
loss of revenue). This included examining the potential impacts on 
our own operations and potential impacts on our suppliers, which 
could, in turn, affect the security of supply of goods and services 
to Vodafone. We assessed the extent to which the steps in the 
impact pathways could occur in a range of scenarios based on 
published research of future market, policy and legal and 
stakeholder sentiment trends and forecasts. 
The results of our qualitative scenarios analysis of transition risks 
and opportunities supplement the findings of our 2022 
quantitative scenarios analysis of physical risks. In combination, 
these provide us with a reasonable and holistic view of how our 
highest priority climate-related risks and opportunities could play 
out over time.

(3) Manage 
As part of our enterprise risk management framework, climate change 
is discussed and prioritised, relative to other risks, during the principal 
risk assessment process. During FY24, climate change was 
consolidated as a sub-risk of ESG risk, in recognition that climate is 
one of several wider ESG risks that we intend to manage holistically. 
In addition, this aligns with our internal governance structures for ESG, 
which encompass all aspects of our Protecting the Planet and wider 
Purpose strategy. ESG risk was considered a watchlist risk, partly due 
to the time horizon of climate-related risk being mostly outside the 
immediate three-year business planning cycle.
Read more about our ESG governance arrangements 
on page 33 
We will continue to monitor ESG risk as this agenda continues to 
evolve in the coming years. In addition, due to the nature of the 
priority climate-related risks to our business and strategy, many 
elements are already captured in existing principal risks, such as 
extreme weather events leading to technology failure, adverse policy 
environment resulting in increased costs or increased energy costs 
arising due to adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions. This 
approach enables us to capture a more holistic picture of the 
climate-related risks, both in the short term and long term.
As required by our risk management framework, once a risk is 
identified and assessed, a risk owner is responsible for developing and 
implementing the mitigating actions and controls. This year, we 
incorporated the key mitigating actions for our highest priority 
climate-related risks and opportunities into our CTP and assigned 
accountability to leaders in relevant business functions for managing 
and monitoring these.
Click to read our Climate Transition Plan  
www.vodafone.com/ctp 
(4) Assure and monitor
We use a three lines model, as detailed in the Group risk management 
framework, when managing risks. Relevant assurance providers, such 
as control owners in the first and second line, are responsible for 
reviewing the policies, procedures and other relevant information  
to check whether the controls are effective and update them  
as necessary. 
Read more about our Group risk management framework  
on pages 57-63
(5) Report
As described in the Governance section of this report, reporting of our 
climate-related risks is integrated into our enterprise risk 
management framework and processes, which are overseen by ARC. 
The Group Risk team reports Vodafone’s principal risks, watchlist risks 
and emerging risks to the ExCo and the Board, including any material 
climate-related risks that are identified through risk analyses. During 
the year, if climate-related risks are identified at operational level, 
they are reported to the local risk and compliance committee within 
each market and escalated to the Group Risk and Compliance 
Committee if required.

Metrics and targets
We have set targets to reduce GHG emissions from both our own 
operations and across our full value chain. In FY24, we set region-
specific net zero targets for our operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2) 
in recognition that the transition pathway and challenges are 
fundamentally different in Europe and Africa. Although our transition 
pathways differ by region, we are retaining our overall near-term 
science-based target to reduce the emissions from our own 
operations (Scope 1 and 2) by at least 90% by 2030 across our global 
business, against a FY20 baseline. 
The Protecting the Planet section of our Annual Report, together with 
our ESG Addendum and Methodology document, details our 
approach to measuring and reducing GHG emissions. We measure 
and report our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (including all 15 categories 
of Scope 3). We also have metrics in place to measure energy use; 
one of the key underlying factors in our exposure to climate-related 
transition risk.

Climate-related considerations are factored into our executive 
remuneration, by way of an annual emission reduction target. This is 
linked to our near-term science-based target to reduce the emissions 
from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) by at least 90% by 2030 
across our global business, against a FY20 baseline. 3.3% of executive 
long-term incentive plan is linked to this climate metric. We continue 
to explore how we can integrate climate resilience into our reward 
structures, objectives and incentives.
Read more about how ESG is incorporated into our remuneration policy 
on page 108
We continue to measure our exposure to physical risks, for example, 
the percentage of our high-value assets that are vulnerable to 
physical risks in Europe. 
We report annually on the carbon emissions avoided through the use 
of our digital solutions, which we consider to be one of our most significant 
climate-related commercial opportunities, known as ‘carbon enablement’.

measure carbon enablement in 
our ESG Addendum:

esgaddendum
Read more about our targets for 
enablement on page 41
Whilst these are important steps forward on our climate-related risk 
disclosure journey, we recognise that we have not yet set targets or 
put metrics in place to measure our full suite of climate-related 
physical and transition risks. We remain committed to setting these 
metrics and targets in line with the refreshed list of our priority 
climate-related risks and opportunities. The establishment of metrics 
and targets will form part of the implementation of our transition plan, 
which commenced from 1 April 2024. We intend to develop metrics 
and targets within the coming year. Our transition plan also outlines 
the areas of uncertainty, dependency on key external factors and risks 
to the delivery of our targets. 
Currently, we are also considering the opportunity to use an internal 
carbon price as part of our decision-making. An internal carbon price 
puts a financial value on the climate impact of our business decisions 
(such as purchasing goods or undertaking capital projects). We have 
begun to explore potential options for an internal carbon price, for 
evaluation and possible implementation in future years.

Board evaluation
Progress in the year
The FY24 Board evaluation reported improvements had been achieved in:
 – Leadership: In July 2023, the appointment of Luka Mucic from 1 September 2023 
as the Chief Financial Officer was announced. The Nominations and Governance 
Committee and the Board have also considered succession planning at a number 
of meetings.
 – Operational performance: The Board spent a full day in September 2023 
focusing on the Group’s three strategic priorities and the initiatives supporting 
them. Additional sessions and updates on these initiatives featured in the 
remaining FY24 Board meetings including a deep dive into the satellite 
strategy and an update on deep detractor reductions.
 – Technology: In May 2023, the Board approved the establishment of the 
Technology Committee. The Committee has met three times during FY24 
and focused on the current technology strategy including deep dives and 
the budgeting process for FY24.

Nominations and Governance Committee
In addition to keeping under review developments in corporate 
governance and the Company’s responses to them, the Nominations 
and Governance Committee makes recommendations to the Board 
about Board composition and ensures Board diversity and the necessary 
balance of skills. The Committee recognises the need to anticipate 
the skills and attributes that will be needed on the Board as the Company 
develops. Committee focus during FY24 was on the appointment of 
the Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer, the 
establishment of the Technology Committee, and Board Committee 
composition following the departure of long-standing Non-Executive 
Directors at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. The Committee has also 
spent time reviewing the bench strength of management.

performance, and succession planning; financial reporting, risk, internal processes and controls; 
remuneration practices; environmental, sustainability and governance topics; and technology strategy. 
Audit and Risk Committee
The Committee oversees the Group’s financial reporting, risk 
management, internal control and assurance processes, and the 
external audit. This includes in-depth reviews of our principal risks, the 
review of our Annual Report and a programme of deep dives across 
multiple business units with a focus on the risk and control 
environment. The Committee also monitors the activities and 
effectiveness of the internal audit function and has primary 
responsibility for overseeing the relationship with the external auditor. 
Deep-dive topics during FY24 included reviews of adverse changes in 
macroeconomic conditions, disintermediation risk, adverse political and 
policy environment, strategic transformation, cyber threats, supply 
chain disruption, technology, data management and privacy. Entity 
deep-dives included the cluster of markets within the Other Europe 
segment, Vodafone Spain, Vodafone Germany, Vodafone UK, Vantage 
Towers and Vodafone Business. The Committee also has joint 
responsibility, with the ESG Committee, for reviewing the 
appropriateness and adequacy of ESG disclosures provided within the 
Annual Report and the ESG Addendum, including approving its content.

Other information

Dear shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Corporate 
Governance Report for the year ended 31 March 2024.
This report provides details about the Board and an explanation of our 
individual roles and responsibilities. It also provides an insight into the 
activities of the Board and Committees over the year and how we 
seek to ensure the highest standards of corporate governance remain 
embedded throughout the Company, underpinning and supporting 
our business and the decisions we make.
The year in review
In May 2023, we set out a new roadmap for Vodafone, based on our 
need to change and focus on three priorities: Customers, Simplicity 
and Growth. Since then we have seen Vodafone’s transformation 
progress, and I would like to give great thanks to my fellow Directors, 
the executive team, and the people of Vodafone for their spirit, 
ambition and hard work. There is much more that needs to be done 
for us to achieve our ambition of being a best-in-class telco in Europe 
and Africa, as well as the leading platform for business in Europe, but I 
am confident we are on the right trajectory. 
Strategic Transformation
This financial year has seen a lot of transactional activity for Vodafone. 
In May 2023, we announced entering into a strategic partnership and 
Relationship Agreement with Emirates Telecommunications Group 
Company PJSC (‘e&’), establishing e& as a cornerstone shareholder of 
the Company. The strategic relationship enables collaboration across 
a broad range of growth areas. Under the terms of the Relationship 
Agreement, the Group Chief Executive Officer of e&, Hatem Dowidar, 
joined the Vodafone Board as a Non-Executive Director on 19 
February 2024. The e& Group Chief Executive will have the right to be 
an appointed Non-Executive Director, subject to shareholder approval, 
for as long as e& maintains its current shareholding of 14.6%. 
In June 2023, we announced entering into a binding agreement with 
Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings Limited in relation to a 
combination of our UK telecommunication businesses, Vodafone UK 
and Three UK. If approved, this merger will be great for customers, 
great for the country and great for competition. It is transformative 
and will create a best-in-Europe 5G network. 
In October 2023, we announced the sale of Vodafone Spain, which we 
believe is a key step in right-sizing our portfolio for growth and will 
enable us to focus our resources in markets with sustainable 
structures and sufficient local scale.
In November 2023, we announced a strategic partnership with 
Accenture to accelerate the commercialisation of our shared 
operations to advance growth, enhance customer service and drive 
significant efficiencies for Vodafone’s operating companies and partner 
markets, as well as create new career opportunities for our people.
On 16 January 2024, we signed a 10-year strategic partnership with 
Microsoft to bring generative AI, digital services and the cloud to more 
than 300 million businesses and consumers.
On 15 March 2024, we announced the sale of Vodafone Italy to 
Swisscom AG and a broad review of our capital allocation 
considering the investment profile of the Group’s strategy within 
its reshaped footprint. 
The capital allocation review concluded that country-level capital 
intensity would be broadly maintained at existing levels, a robust 
balance sheet would be maintained with a new leverage policy, the 
ordinary dividend would be rebased to 4.5 eurocents per share 
from FY25 onwards, and there would be an opportunity for share 
buybacks following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain 
and Vodafone Italy.
These transactions formed part of Vodafone’s transformational 
progress, with the sale of Vodafone Italy being the last step in our 
portfolio transformation, helping us to move forward with our 
roadmap and achieve our ambition. 
Board composition
Executive Directors
Luka Mucic joined the Board as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 
September 2023 following an extensive external recruitment process 
with the support of Egon Zehnder, an independent external search 
firm. The Board and I have been impressed with the pace with which 
Luka has got to grips with the Company and the strong relationship 
he and Margherita are building. 
The appointment of Luka enabled Margherita Della Valle to fully 
transition into her role as Group Chief Executive. During the year, 
Margherita has continued to demonstrate her strong capabilities in 
being able to lead the necessary transformation of Vodafone. 
Non-Executive Directors
As I discussed in last year’s report, there were a number of scheduled 
changes in the composition of our Non-Executive Directors expected 
during FY24, with the retirement of Valerie Gooding, Sir Crispin Davis 
and Dame Clara Furse. David Nish was appointed Senior Independent 
Director, Amparo Moraleda was appointed Remuneration Committee 
Chair and Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon were 
appointed Workforce Engagement Leads.
Following Hatem Dowidar’s appointment earlier this year, he has 
begun a full induction programme, including meetings with 
executives leading our businesses and functions.
The Board and Nominations and Governance Committee anticipate 
scheduled retirements in FY25 and, therefore, already have a renewed 
focus on succession planning. We will continue to closely monitor the 
diversity and skill sets needed to drive the Company forward. 
Diversity
Our commitment to having a Board diverse in all aspects firmly 
remains. The Nominations and Governance Committee continues to 
support the Board in monitoring requirements and best practices. We 
are proud to meet gender targets requiring Boards to comprise of at 
least 40% women. This includes our Group Chief Executive, 
Margherita Della Valle. We also exceed the Parker Review target to 
have at least one Director from a minority ethnic group.
Beyond the Board, you may recall that last year we announced the 
introduction of a new ethnic diversity target, for 25% of our global 
senior leadership to be from ethnically diverse backgrounds by 2030. 
We are making great progress towards this target.
Skills
The changes in composition in the year have bolstered the Board and 
demonstrated that diversity, skills and knowledge are effectively 
regarded when composition is considered. The Board and I believe 
our composition, with highly relevant sector expertise, makes us well 
placed to advise and provide management oversight.
On 10 May 2023, the Board approved the creation of a Technology 
Committee to oversee the technology strategy and how it supports 
the overall Company strategy. The Committee was established on 25 
July 2023 and has already proved to be a significant enhancement to 
our governance structure.
Evaluation
For the second year in a row, the Board undertook an internal 
evaluation which I led with support from the Group General Counsel 
and Company Secretary. Individual Directors were invited to complete 
a self-assessment questionnaire as well as speaking with me 
We take our commitment to strong and robust 
corporate governance seriously

Compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’)
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2024, Vodafone Group Plc 
was subject to the Code (available from www.frc.org.uk). The Board 
is pleased to confirm that Vodafone applied the principles and 
complied with all the provisions of the Code throughout the year. 
Further information on compliance with the Code can be found as follows:
one-on-one. In a change from prior years, response was also sought 
from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. I am 
delighted to report there was a clear consensus that the Board is 
very effective in working together as a cohesive unit and continues 
to improve following the changes made during the year. A number of 
strengths were identified as well as key areas for focus during the 
year ahead. 
Executive Committee composition
With effect from 1 April 2024, we made a number of changes to our 
Executive Committee. Ahmed Essam was appointed Executive 
Chairman Vodafone Germany and CEO European Markets, Serpil 
Timuray was appointed CEO Vodafone Investments, and Philippe 
Rogge stood down from his role as CEO Vodafone Germany and as a 
member of the Group Executive Committee, leaving Vodafone. Marcel 
de Groot was appointed CEO Vodafone Germany and Max Taylor 
appointed CEO Vodafone UK. Both Marcel and Max report to Ahmed 
Essam but are not members of the Executive Committee, 
Marika Auramo has been appointed CEO of Vodafone Business and a 
member of Vodafone’s Executive Committee, with effect from 1 July 
2024. Marika will take over from Giorgio Migliarina, who has 
successfully led Vodafone Business as interim CEO since Vinod 
Kumar’s departure on 31 December 2023. 
Stakeholder engagement
The Board is committed to understanding the views of all of 
Vodafone’s stakeholders to inform the decisions that we make. We 
recognise that Vodafone’s success is dependent on the Board taking 
decisions for the benefit of our shareholders and in doing so having 
regard to all our stakeholders.
Throughout the year, I have met with institutional shareholders both 
virtually and in person. In March 2024, I had individual meetings with a 
number of the Company’s largest shareholders and engaged on 
topics such as capital allocation, Board composition and the shape of 
the Group. Further resources were made available to individual 
shareholders during the year, such as online presentations hosted by 
the UK Individual Shareholders Society. I have also met senior political 
leaders in both my role as Vodafone Chair and as the Chair of the 
European Round Table for Industry. These include presidents and 
prime ministers across our markets and in key international organisations 
such as the European Commission. The Board received an update on 
the investor perception study completed during the year. 
The Board understands the importance of culture and setting the 
tone of the organisation from the top and embedding it throughout 
the Group. We refer to our culture as the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’. It is a key 
component of our strategic, organisational and digital transformation. 
The aim of our people strategy is to create an environment where 
growing never stops and everyone can truly belong, innovate and 
fulfil their potential. The Board receives regular updates on employee 
engagement and the ‘Spirit of Vodafone’, which enables it to make 
informed decisions where appropriate.
During the year, in their roles as Workforce Engagement Leads, 
Delphine Ernotte Cunci and Christine Ramon gathered the views of 
employees through employee consultative committees across our 
European and African markets. Key discussion topics included 
customer experience, and personal development and reskilling 
opportunities.
The Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in 2023 was held at Vodafone UK’s 
headquarters in Newbury, Berkshire and was available to watch live via a 
webcast for those shareholders who were unable to attend in person. 
Shareholders were able to pre-submit questions or, if attending in 
person, ask questions on the day, for consideration by the Directors at 
the meeting. We intend to hold the 2024 AGM in the same format.

creation and monitor the Company’s progress on the execution of

Governance (continued)
Our Company purpose, values and culture 
Purpose 
Our purpose is to connect for a better future. We aim to create a 
digital society where everyone can thrive. The digital society that we 
help to enable makes communities more prosperous and resilient. 
However, we must seek to ensure that everyone is included, and that 
progress does not come at the cost of the planet. This is why we place 
Empowering People, Protecting the Planet, and Maintaining Trust at 
the heart of our business, guiding everything we do. Our purpose is 
championed by our Board, which is collectively responsible for the 
oversight and long-term success of the Company. It is aligned with 
our culture and our strategy, placed at the forefront of our decision 
making and strategy development, and the Board considers how the 
initiatives progressed by management throughout the year have 
advanced our purpose. Board oversight ensures that continued 
product development realises our ambition to connect for a better 
future. 
Read more about our purpose on pages 34-56
Strategy
The Board monitors the Company’s progress against established 
strategic objectives and its performance against competitors. Board 
meetings are planned with reference to the Company’s strategic 
priorities and meeting agendas are constructed to deliver information 
at appropriate junctures and from a broad range of senior leaders, to 
enable the Board to effectively review and challenge.
Read more about Vodafone’s roadmap on page 9
Governance
The Board ensures the highest standard of corporate governance 
is maintained by regularly reviewing developments in governance 
best practice and ensuring these are adopted by the Company.
During the year, the Board dedicated time to thoroughly evaluate its 
own effectiveness and that of each of the Directors individually, taking 
into account their independence, time commitment, preparation 
ahead of meetings, courage to challenge and whether they continue 
to contribute effectively. Consideration was also given to the 
arrangements in place to monitor conflicts of interest.
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary, 
who is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters 
and ensuring the Board has access to the necessary policies, 
processes and resources to operate efficiently and effectively.
Read more about our governance structure and roles and responsibilities  
on pages 74-75
Values and culture
The Board has a critical role in setting the tone of our organisation and 
championing the behaviours we expect to see throughout the Group. 
The ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ aligns with our purpose and strategy, which 
ultimately leads to a more motivated and productive workforce. 
The Board has continued to influence and monitor culture throughout 
the year and received updates on ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ initiatives, 
including ‘Spirit of Vodafone’ Days, bi-annual Spirit Beat surveys, the 
global pulse survey and surveys shared with new hires and leavers. 
The cultural climate in Vodafone is measured through a number of 
mechanisms including policy and compliance processes, internal 
audit, and formal and informal channels for employees to raise 
concerns. The latter includes our Spirit Beat survey and our 
whistleblowing programme, Speak Up, which is also available to the 
contractors and suppliers working with us. The Board is apprised of 
any material whistleblowing incidents.
Alongside these mechanisms, the Board remains committed to 
engagement with the workforce, and these opportunities continue to 
shape how the Board influences and understands the Company’s culture.
Read more about Speak Up on page 44
Employee engagement 
Given the geographical size and complexity of our business, we utilise 
several employee engagement methods and communication 
channels between the Board, the Executive Committee, and our 
workforce to enable meaningful engagement.
Examples of these initiatives include:
Workforce Engagement Lead attendance at employee forums
The Board received feedback from Delphine Ernotte Cunci and 
Christine Ramon, the appointed Workforce Engagement Leads, after 
their attendance at employee forums in Europe and Africa. It is 
evident from these meetings that employee delegates continue to 
appreciate the opportunity to speak directly to a Board member. 
Through these channels we understand that our people are engaged 
and interested in market mergers & acquisitions, the customer 
experience and opportunities for personal development and reskilling.
Workplace communications
‘Workplace’ is our internal digital platform that allows employees to 
start conversations and groups on topics of their choice. The 
Executive Committee and internal communications team regularly 
post on the platform to provide updates to our people. Employees are 
in turn able to post and directly respond with views and questions. 
Key highlights in the year are shown in the table below:
Post

held in Germany, Italy, the UK, the EU Cluster and with _VOIS. These 
‘townhall’ meetings focused on each markets progress of our action plans in

collective ambition to keep accelerating our transformation and the drive to 
do better to serve our customers and be a best-in-class telco in Europe and 
Africa as well as Europe’s leading B2B platform.
Financial results and  
Group performance
Our business strategy

experiences throughout their time at Vodafone. We proactively gather 
employees’ perspectives through the new hire life cycle, measuring 
sentiment in the first week, month and 90 days. Exiting employees are 
requested to feedback 48 hours after logging their notice.

Board activities and principal decisions
Our Board is responsible for the overall leadership 
of the Group and, throughout the year, Board 
activities and discussion continued to focus on the 
Company’s strategic priorities. 
The Board oversees the Company’s strategic direction and supports 
the executive management with its delivery of the strategy within a 
transparent governance framework. Alongside deep-dives on the 
strategic priorities and overall shape of the Group, the Board has 
considered topics including the business plan, financial performance, 
digital and technology, and governance. Further detail on these topics 
is set out below.
Key stakeholders are considered in the decision-making process in 
accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.

Customers
Our customers remained a key focus throughout FY24 as we began 
implementing the strategic transformation action plan communicated 
in last year’s Annual Report. 
Read more about our strategic transformation on pages 8-9 
Information about the evolving needs of customers is regularly 
provided to the Board by the Executive Committee members and 
senior leaders. 
Customer action plan 
The Board received an update on customer satisfaction and 
experience in markets across the Group in an interactive strategy 
session held in September 2023. Discussion focused on the issues 
faced by customers in each market and the implementation of seven 
key actions as part of the renewed customer action plan. 
The Board visited the contact centre in Stoke-on-Trent in January 
2024 to see the UK customer action plan in progress. The Board 
spent time with employees on the front line who have a deep 
understanding of customer needs and were informed of service 
improvements being made across all of our markets. The Board 
received an update on the CX transformation progress and joined the 
specialist care, business care, operations centre and digital centre 
divisions during their visit to delve more deeply into operational 
performance.
Vodafone Germany
The Board considered a proposed agreement with 1&1 Mobilfunk 
GmbH (‘1&1’) and, on 2 August 2023, we announced that a long-term 
national roaming partnership had been agreed. The agreement 
supports current and future mobile technologies and will deliver 5G 
mobile coverage to customers from the second half of calendar year 
2024. The impact of inflation and evolution of technology were key 
considerations that have been reflected in the agreement. 
The market in Germany was a deep-dive topic discussed by the Board 
during the year. The review considered key long-term transformative 
initiatives across the three strategic priorities: Customers, Simplicity 
and Growth. 
Cost-of-living crisis
The Board was updated on the Company’s cost-of-living initiative to 
ensure that consumers and small businesses continued to be supported.
Digital and technology 
Technology Committee 
The Board approved the creation of a Technology Committee as a 
Committee of the Board on 10 May 2023. Subsequently, the 
Technology Committee has kept the Board updated on the 
development and implementation of the technology strategy. Focus 
was given to the Tech2025 vision, which aims to enable digital 
transformation to better serve our Customers, drive Simplicity and 
enable Growth. 
Read more about the Technology Committee  
on page 95
Strategic partnerships and artificial intelligence
The Board has considered the impact of artificial intelligence on 
different areas of the business. 
On 13 November 2023, we announced plans to create a strategic 
partnership with Accenture to commercialise shared operations to 
accelerate growth, enhance customer service and drive significant 
efficiencies for our operating companies and partner markets. The 
partnership will utilise Accenture’s world-class technology and 
transformation services such as digital solutions and platforms, and 
it’s deep artificial intelligence expertise. The strategic partnership is 
subject to completion of definitive agreements.
On 16 January 2024, the Company announced a 10-year strategic 
partnership with Microsoft that aims to leverage our respective 
strengths to bring generative artificial intelligence, digital services and 
the cloud to more than 300 million businesses and consumers, 
transforming the customer experience. The five key areas of 
collaboration are generative artificial intelligence, scaling IoT, digital 
acceleration in Africa, enterprise growth and cloud transformation.
Financial performance and capital
Financial performance
Throughout the year, the Board received regular updates on the 
financial performance of the Group from the CFO and management 
team. Trading performance and financial forecasts were reviewed 
against the backdrop of strategic transformation, rising energy prices 
and inflation pressures. 
The Board reviewed the Group’s performance versus the budget for 
last year. The budget for the coming year and long-range plan were 
approved. 
During the year, the Board considered and approved the half-year and 
full-year results announcements, and the Annual Report and 
Accounts, following the recommendation of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. 
Capital allocation review 
On 15 March 2024, we announced that the Company had conducted 
a broad capital allocation review, considering the investment profile 
of the Group’s strategy within its reshaped footprint. The review 
concluded that country-level capital intensity would be broadly 
maintained at existing levels, a robust balance sheet would be 
maintained with a new leverage policy, the ordinary dividend would 
be rebased to 4.5 eurocents per share from FY25 onwards, and there 
would be an opportunity for share buybacks following the completion 
of the sale of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy. 
Dividend
The decision to approve the dividend was supported by a robust 
assessment of the position, performance and viability of the business 
carried out by management. On 14 November 2023, we announced 
an interim dividend of 4.50 eurocents per share, which was paid on 
2 February 2024. We have recommended a final dividend of 4.5 
eurocents per share to be paid on 2 August 2024. This is consistent 
with dividends declared during FY23 and the expectations of our 
shareholders.

UK
Board discussion focused on the strategic 
options available to the UK business. The 
proposed merger of Vodafone UK and 
Three UK provides the necessary scale to 
be able to accelerate the rollout of full 5G 
coverage, benefiting customers through 
competitively priced access to a reliable, 
high-quality, and secure 5G network 
throughout the UK. The transaction is great 
for customers, great for the country and 
great for competition. 
Subject to regulatory and shareholder 
approvals, the transaction is expected to 
close around the end of 2024. 
Key steps to date
 – October 2022: we confirmed that 
discussions were taking place with CK 
Hutchison Holdings (‘CK Hutchison’) in 
relation to a possible combination of 
Vodafone UK and Three UK;
 – June 2023: we announced that binding 
agreements had been entered into with 
CK Hutchison;
 – December 2023: engagement with 
political and regulatory stakeholders 
continued; and 
 – January 2024: filing with the UK 
Competition and Markets Authority. As 
anticipated, in April 2024 the merger 
inquiry progressed to Phase 2.
Spain 
The Board received regular updates on the 
transaction opportunities available to the 
business portfolio in Spain. In October 2023, 
we announced that the Board had taken the 
decision to enter into binding agreements 
with Zegona Communications plc (‘Zegona’) 
for the sale of Vodafone Holdings Europe, 
S.L.U. (‘Vodafone Spain’). The sale of 
Vodafone Spain is a key step in right-sizing 
the Group’s portfolio for growth and will 
enable us to focus our resources in markets 
with sustainable structures and sufficient 
local scale, improving the Group’s 
competitiveness. The transaction is subject to 
regulatory clearance.
Key steps to date
 – May 2023: the Board considered 
transaction opportunities across the Group; 
 – September 2023: the Board received an 
update on the structure of a proposed deal 
and discussed the options available; and
 – October 2023: we announced that the 
Board had approved the request to enter 
into binding agreements with Zegona in 
relation to the full sale of Vodafone Spain. 
Italy 
Vodafone has engaged extensively with 
several parties to explore market 
consolidation in Italy, including through a 
merger or disposal. The Board is supportive 
of in-market consolidation and has 
discussed the merits and risks of each 
option presented at length. Following 
input, the options available were narrowed 
and in March 2023, we announced that a 
binding agreement had been entered into 
with Swisscom AG (‘Swisscom’) for the sale 
of Vodafone Italy. The sale supports the 
new strategic direction of the Group and is 
subject to regulatory clearance. 
Key steps to date
 – December 2023: we reiterated that 
Vodafone is supportive of in-market 
consolidation in countries where 
appropriate returns on invested capital 
are not being achieved and confirmed 
that options with several parties were 
being explored to achieve this in Italy; 
 – February 2024: we announced that 
Vodafone was in exclusive discussions 
with Swisscom regarding a potential 
sale of Vodafone Italy to Swisscom; and 
 – March 2024: we announced that a 
binding agreement had been entered 
into with Swisscom for the sale of 
Vodafone Italy. The sale is the third and 
final step in the reshaping of the Group’s 
European operations. Subject to 
regulatory approval, the sale to 
Swisscom will create significant value 
and ensures the business maintains its 
leading position in Italy. 
Strategy and business developments
Shape of the Group
The Board spent a significant amount of time during FY24 discussing our strategic priorities and the shape and size of the Group to support these. 
In addition to the scheduled Board meetings, several adhoc meetings were held to consider strategic transactions. The Board also attended a 
strategy off-site session in Germany that focused on strategic evolution, execution of the strategic priorities and portfolio objectives. 
Section 172 considerations 
In accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act, the Board, with support from external advisers where required, undertook an analysis as 
part of the decision-making process to consider stakeholder interests and whether each of the proposed transactions was in the best interests 
of the Company’s members as a whole. The following factors were taken into consideration by the Board in its analysis and decision-making: 
terms and structure proposed; strategic and financial rationale; business plan and business case; valuation; due diligence findings; associated 
risks; regulatory, legal and governance considerations; the impact on employees and customers; and market perception. Following 
deliberation, the Board concluded that the proposed transactions were in the best interests of the Company, and aligned with our strategic 
priorities. The transactions in Spain and Italy will deliver €12 billion of upfront cash proceeds. As part our broader capital allocation review, the 
Company intends to return up to €2 billion to shareholders via buybacks following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain, with an 
opportunity for further share buybacks of up to €2 billion following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Italy. 
Investor relations
The Board received regular updates on market share information, 
share price performance and how we have engaged with institutional 
investors and analysts. Sentiment and feedback from investor 
roadshows and conferences was also provided during the year.

Board effectiveness and improving our performance
Board evaluation findings
The Board discussed the findings from the evaluation and was encouraged by the strengths identified. In particular, the Board agreed that: 
Effectiveness
The Board is very effective in working together as a cohesive unit and continues to improve following the changes made 
during FY24. Board members are very collaborative, respectful and flexible when urgent ad-hoc matters arise. 
Key strengths of the Board were highlighted as being:
 – Collaborative, effective and well prepared.
 – An active, open and engaged Chair.
 – The ability to act promptly and decisively, as demonstrated through the CEO change.
 – Alignment between the Directors on strategy and tactics.
 – Its composition with highly relevant sector expertise to advise and provide management oversight. 
Directors were asked to share their thoughts and considerations of the appointment process of the Chief Financial 
Officer to assist in evaluating the Board’s effectiveness. The comments reflected a very positive experience, 
underscoring the effectiveness of the Board’s action and processes:
 – “A very focused and effective process balancing input and clear direction- with a good outcome.”
 – “Good engagement and challenge… ended in the right place.” 
 – “Transparent and effective.”
 – “Conducted very thoughtfully.”
 – “Completed at appropriate speed and an excellent candidate was appointed.” 
The Board recognises that it needs to continually 
monitor and improve its performance. Our annual 
performance evaluation provides the opportunity 
for the Board and its Committees to consider and 
reflect on the effectiveness of its activities, the 
quality of its decision-making and the contribution 
made by each Board member.
Process undertaken for our Board evaluation
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, an 
annual evaluation of the Board was conducted to consider its 
composition, diversity and how effectively members work together to 
achieve objectives. In FY24, the Board evaluation was conducted 
internally, bringing Vodafone back into the typical three-year 
evaluation cycle.

evaluation 
Evaluation process
The internal evaluation was led by the Chair and supported by the 
Group General Counsel and Company Secretary. The objectives of the 
review were to provide an assessment of:
 – Vodafone Group’s Board effectiveness and governance;
 – The effectiveness of Vodafone Group’s Committees; and
 – The effectiveness of Directors individually, taking into account their 
preparation ahead of meetings, time commitment, independence 
and courage to challenge.
The structure of the evaluation was agreed to take a hybrid format, 
comprising self-assessment questionnaires for the Directors and 
one-on-one conversational meetings with the Chair. In a change from 
prior years, response was also sought from the Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary to enable greater scrutiny and 
provide an additional review for consideration and reflection. 
With strong regard to the provisions and principles outlined in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2018 and matters of specific importance 
to Vodafone, a tailored Board questionnaire consisting of 27 questions 
was compiled to gather and distil feedback on the following topics:
 – Effectiveness;
 – Skills, composition and diversity;
 – Leadership (the appraisal of the Chair, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, was included here);
 – Fundamentals of administration and process; and
 – Board Committees.
Conversely, the one-on-one meetings between Directors and the 
Chair took a less structured form to enable Directors to lead on the 
topics of conversation and raise specific items and comments 
organically. 
The Directors’ responses were collated and a paper summarising the 
findings was presented to the Nominations and Governance 
Committee and the Board at their January 2024 meetings.

Skills, 
composition, and 
diversity
The Board has the appropriate diversity, experience and knowledge, skills and expertise, and time to be as effective as 
possible in the context of developing and delivering the strategy, and addressing the challenges and opportunities, and the 
principal risks facing the Company. Recent changes in composition have bolstered the Board, demonstrating that diversity 
and knowledge were clearly considered when changes were reviewed and agreed. 
The formation of the Technology Committee has been a positive step for the Board and the Company. 
Leadership
The Board has highly effective leadership with a Chair who is successful in gathering inputs and ensuring the Board has 
sufficient time for robust debate and discussion. The Chair is an excellent facilitator, who encourages views from all 
members, with no suppression of contrarian views, which enables meaningful participation.
Fundamentals of 
administration  
and process
Board meetings are of the right frequency and length. Board materials provided allow the Board to effectively carry out its 
responsibilities and provide for the desired level of review and discussion.
The Board also identified and agreed key areas of improvement and focus for FY25: 
Board
Operational excellence: continue to prioritise the time spent on the key strategic pillars of Customers, Simplicity and Growth. 
Workforce engagement and culture: strengthen the structure and engagement plan with greater insight fed back to the Board. 
Focus on the successful integration of the new e& representative as a Director to ensure the effective functioning of the 
Board continues.
Continued focus on succession planning at Board and Senior Managment level. 
 
Progress against the areas identified for focus following the FY23 internal evaluation are shared below:
Areas identified for improvement
Progress 
Leadership: succession planning, including securing and onboarding 
an outstanding Chief Financial Officer
In July 2023, the appointment of Luka Mucic from 1 September 2023 
as the Chief Financial Officer was announced. The Nominations and 
Governance Committee and the Board have also considered succession 
planning in a number of meetings. 
Operational performance: prioritising time spent on the key strategic 
priorities of Customers, Simplicity and Growth
The Board spent a full day in September 2023 focusing on the three 
strategic priorities and the initiatives supporting them. Additional 
sessions and updates on these initiatives featured in the remaining 
FY24 Board meetings including a deep dive into the satellite strategy 
and an update on deep detractor reductions.
Technology: increasing the Board’s focus on technology strategy  
and capital allocation
In May 2023, the Board approved the establishment of the Technology 
Committee. The Committee met three times in FY24 and focused on 
the current technology strategy including deep dives and the 
budgeting process for FY25.
Individual evaluation
Specific questions enabling a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of individual Directors’ performance were included within the self-assessment 
questionnaire. Each individual Director’s effectiveness of contribution was rated, asking the respondent to take into account preparation ahead of 
meetings, time commitment, independence and courage to challenge. The results proved very favourable, concluding that each Director 
continues to make a valuable contribution to Board meetings and to the meetings of the Committees on which they sit, as well as supporting the 
view that the Directors work effectively together to contribute to the Company’s long-term success.
Board Committees
Each of the Board’s Committees were evaluated as part of the broader evaluation process under the final section of the self-assessment 
questionnaire. Questions covered the logistics, performance and effectiveness of Committees and their respective Chairs. The conclusions of this 
review were positive, with Committee members agreeing that the Committees were functioning effectively, with their respective Chairs 
encouraging open communication and meaningful participation. Key strengths of the Committees were highlighted, as were areas for 
improvement.

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Nominations and 
Governance Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2024.
Group Chief Financial Officer – Luka Mucic
Last year we reported that a key focus for the Committee was to 
appoint a Group Chief Financial Officer following our announcement 
that Margherita Della Valle had been appointed permanent Group Chief 
Executive Officer. The Committee formulated a detailed specification, 
taking into consideration the experience, technical knowledge and 
leadership characteristics required for the position of Group Chief 
Financial Officer. An internal review process was undertaken and Egon 
Zehnder, an independent external search firm, was also appointed to 
support the Committee with the search for suitable candidates. A list of 
potential candidates was provided to the Committee for their further 
consideration. Following interviews and further testing of the 
candidates’ credentials, the Committee made a recommendation to the 
Board in July 2023. The Board approved the recommendation to 
appoint Luka Mucic as Group Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 
September 2023. Luka also joined the Executive Committee with effect 
from the same date and he chairs the Risk and Compliance Committee 
and the Capital Decision Board, which are sub-committees of the 
Executive Committee. 
Luka has a strong track record of international leadership, corporate 
repositioning and value creation, and we are pleased to welcome him 
to the Board as the Group undertakes its strategic transformation. 
Luka’s appointment to the Board will be subject to shareholder 
approval at the 2024 AGM. 
Read more on Luka’s background on page 76  
and onboarding on page 88
Board composition and succession planning 
The Committee reviews the composition of the Board and its Committees, 
evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge and 
diversity requirements. It also monitors the length of tenure and skills of 
the Non-Executive Directors to assist with succession planning. 
During the year, Sir Crispin Davis, Dame Clara Furse and Valerie 
Gooding stepped down as Non-Executive Directors following the 
conclusion of the 2023 AGM. With effect from the same date, David 
Nish was appointed Senior Independent Director, Amparo Moraleda 
was appointed Remuneration Committee Chair and Delphine Ernotte 
Cunci and Christine Ramon were appointed Workforce Engagement Leads. 
Following receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, Hatem 
Dowidar, the CEO of e&, Vodafone’s largest shareholder, joined the 
Board as a Non-Executive Director and member of the Nominations 
and Governance Committee on 19 February 2024. Hatem brings to 
the Board extensive experience within the telecommunications 
industry and has held senior positions across a range of companies in 
the Middle East, Africa and Europe. 
The Committee is confident that the Board currently has the 
necessary mix of skills and experience to contribute to the Company’s 
strategic objectives.
 Read more about the details of the length of tenure of each Director and a summary 
of the skills and experience of the Non-Executive Directors on pages 70 and 76-78
Executive Committee changes, succession planning and talent 
pipeline
The Committee receives regular updates on succession planning and 
changes to the membership of the Executive Committee. During the 
year, the Committee discussed succession plans for executives below 
Board level, focusing on the strength, depth and diversity of the talent 
pipeline. A deep-dive assessment of the key leadership roles was also 
undertaken to ensure alignment with the new business strategy and 
operating model.
With effect from 1 April 2024, we made a number of changes to our 
Executive Committee. Ahmed Essam was appointed Executive 
Chairman Vodafone Germany and CEO European Markets. Serpil 
Timuray was appointed CEO Vodafone Investments, taking on 
responsibility for our investments. Philippe Rogge stood down from 
his role as CEO Vodafone Germany and as a member of the Group 
Executive Committee. Marcel de Groot was appointed CEO Vodafone 
Germany and Max Taylor was appointed CEO Vodafone UK. Both 
Marcel and Max report to Ahmed Essam and are not members of the 
Executive Committee.
On 16 April 2024, we announced that Marika Auramo had been 
appointed as CEO of Vodafone Business and a member of Vodafone’s 
Executive Committee, with effect from 1 July 2024. Marika will take over 
from Giorgio Migliarina, who has successfully led Vodafone Business as 
interim CEO since Vinod Kumar’s departure on 31 December 2023. 
Governance
The Committee continues to review action taken to comply with 
the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and other legal 
and regulatory obligations during the year. The Committee receives 
regular governance updates and is satisfied that Vodafone complied 
with the Code in full throughout the year.
Appointment process
When considering the recruitment of new Directors, the Committee 
adopts a formal and transparent procedure, which takes into account 
the skills, knowledge and level of experience required as well as social 
mobility factors and diversity. To begin the appointment process,  
the Company engages with an external search consultancy,  
which it provides with a search specification. The consultancy  
then proposes a list of individuals with a diverse range of backgrounds 
and characteristics. The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by 
Committee members and they meet with the Group Chief Executive, 
Chair and Chief Human Resources Officer. A recommendation is made 
to the Board on the chosen candidate. Once a candidate is selected, 
appointment terms are drafted and agreed with the selected candidate. 
The Committee recognises that it is important for the Board to anticipate 
and prepare for the future and to ensure that the skills, experience, 
knowledge and perspectives of individuals reflect the ongoing needs of 
the Group. Focus has renewed on succession planning at Board level 
in anticipation of upcoming scheduled retirements in 2025.

Independence
In accordance with the Code, the independence of all the Non-
Executive Directors was considered by the Committee. Following 
evaluation, with the exception of Hatem Dowidar, all Non-Executive 
Directors are considered independent, and they continue to make 
independent contributions and effectively challenge management.
All Non-Executive Directors have submitted themselves for election 
or re-election, as applicable, at the 2024 AGM. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts and Non-Executive 
Directors’ appointment letters are available for inspection at our 
registered office and at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.
Conflicts of interest
The Companies Act 2006 provides that directors have a duty to avoid 
a situation in which they have or may have a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This 
duty is in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to 
disclose to the Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement 
under consideration by the Company.
Our Directors must report any changes to their commitments to the Board, 
immediately notify the Company of actual or potential conflicts or a 
change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation, and 
complete an annual conflicts questionnaire. Any conflicts or potential 
conflicts identified are considered and, where appropriate, authorised 
by the Board in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association. 
A register of authorised conflicts is also reviewed periodically.
The Committee is comfortable that it has adequate measures in place to 
effectively identify, manage and mitigate any actual or potential conflicts 
of interest so as not to compromise or override independent judgement. 
Time commitment
In accordance with the Code, the Committee actively reviews the time 
commitments of the Board. All Directors are engaged in providing their 
external commitments to establish that they have sufficient time to 
meet their Board responsibilities. The Committee is satisfied that the 
Board does meet this requirement and all Directors provide constructive 
challenge and strategic guidance and hold management to account.
Board evaluation
In accordance with the Code, Vodafone conducts an annual evaluation 
of Board and Board Committee performance, which every Director 
engages in and which is facilitated by an independent third party at 
least once every three years. In FY24, an internal evaluation of the 
performance of the Board and Committees took place led by the Chair, 
with support from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.

on pages 84-85

Diversity
The Board diversity policy reinforces the ongoing commitment of the Board 
to supporting diversity and inclusion in the boardroom, in all its forms 
including age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and 
socio-economic background. The Committee acknowledges the significant 
role diversity and inclusion has on the effective functioning of the Board and 
its Committees and believes a diverse Board brings a broader perspective, 
which enables it to be better equipped to understand the views of our 
stakeholders as well as our shareholders in the decision-making process. 
The Board diversity policy is kept under review to ensure 
the objectives remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching. We also 
continue to monitor requirements set by the Financial Conduct 
Authority, FTSE Women Leaders Review, NASDAQ listing rules and 
Parker Review in terms of gender and ethnic diversity. Vodafone 
acknowledges that these targets are not just an end goal, but rather 
steps towards a drive for further progress.
Whilst the Board Diversity Policy specifically focuses on diversity at 
Board and Committee level, commitment to diversity at Vodafone 
extends beyond the Board to the Executive Committee, talent 
pipeline and global workforce. The Board supports management in 
their efforts to build a diverse organisation throughout the Group and 
is regularly apprised of progress on the key diversity areas of focus 
beyond the Board and Executive Committee. As at 31 March 2024, 
our Executive Committee has four positions held by women (33%) 
and 25% of the Executive Committee identifies as ethnically diverse. 
In the Senior Leadership Team, 37% of positions (from continuing 
operations) are held by women and 21% of the Senior Leadership 
Team (from continuing operations) identifies as ethnically diverse.

Diversity targets – progress update
Target
Progress
The Board aspires to meet and ultimately exceed the target 
for at least 40% of Board positions to be held by women. 
As at 31 March 2024, 42% of our Board identified as women.
That at least one of the positions of Chair, CEO, CFO or 
Senior Independent Director is held by a woman. 
As at 31 March 2024 our Group Chief Executive Officer position is held by a 
woman.
That at least one member of the Board is from a minority 
ethnic background. 
As at 31 March 2024, we currently have two Board members from a minority 
background, and we continually aspire to increase diverse representation on our Board.

meetings with external advisers and stakeholders, Luka met with 
internal stakeholders responsible for the key business operations 
within his reporting line. His induction covered a range of topics 
including strategy, finance, commercial, legal and governance. Luka 
also attended teach-in sessions with the networks and digital teams. 
Upon joining the Board as Non-Executive Directors, Christine Ramon 
and Hatem Dowidar undertook a tailored onboarding programme 
covering a range of areas of the business including, strategy, finance, 
risk, and stakeholder matters. They also met with senior management 
from key business areas and functions, and received a briefing from 
our external advisers which included: Directors’ duties; the Market 
Abuse Regulation; and listing and disclosure obligations. Prior to 
Hatem joining, Christine, alongside the Chair, attended a meeting with 
employees after the 2023 AGM in Newbury. She also met with 
employees during the Board site visit to the call centre in Stoke-on-
Trent.
Upon appointment, all Directors receive a comprehensive induction 
pack which includes key background information on the Company, 
corporate governance guidance, and internal policies and codes. 
Director development and training
As the external business environment in which the Group operates 
continues to evolve, it is crucial that our Directors’ skills and 
knowledge are refreshed and updated regularly. The Chair has overall 
responsibility for ensuring that our Non-Executive Directors receive 
suitable ongoing training to enable each to remain an effective Board 
member. Individual training requirements are reviewed regularly and 
the Board is kept informed of training opportunities, including those 
offered by our external advisers. 
In addition to individual tailored training, updates on corporate 
governance, legal and regulatory matters are also provided by way of 
briefing papers and presentations at Board meetings. 
The data contained in the tables on this page was collected as part of 
the annual declaration process, whereby the Board and the Executive 
Committee received declaration forms for self-completion. The 
declaration forms included, for all individuals whose data is being 
reported, the same questions relating to ethnicity, gender, sexual 
orientation and disability. The data is used for statistical reporting 
purposes and is provided with consent. The data in the above tables is 
as at 31 March 2024, and there have been no changes in the period 
between then and the date of this report.
Whilst we commit to diversity and inclusion in all its forms, all 
appointments are made on merit and objective criteria to ensure the 
appropriate mix of skills and experience on the Board, valuing the 
unique contribution that an individual will bring.

Upon appointment, each new Director receives a comprehensive and 
formal induction programmed tailored to their needs, experience and 
the requirements of the role. Consideration is also given to 
Committee appointments and the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary assists the Chair in designing and facilitating the 
individual programmes. Onboarding is crucial to ensuring that our 
Directors have a full understanding of all aspects of our business, 
including the Group’s strategy, vision and values, to ensure they are 
able to contribute effectively to the Board. All Directors are also 
encouraged to attend site visits.

Letter from the Committee Chair
I am pleased to present our report as Chair of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. This report provides an overview of how the Committee 
operates, an insight into the Committee’s activities during the year 
and its role in ensuring the integrity of the Group’s published financial 
information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls 
and related processes.
The Committee met five times during the year, which included a joint 
meeting with the ESG Committee. The attendance by members at 
Committee meetings can be seen on page 70. Each meeting agenda 
included a range of topics across the Committee’s areas of 
responsibility:
 – We undertook a programme of reviews across multiple business 
units, typically with a focus on the risk and control environment. 
This was performed with the CEO and CFO of the Other Europe 
markets cluster, the CEOs of Vodafone Germany, Vodafone UK, 
Vodafone Spain and Vodacom Group, the Chief Commercial Officer 
and CEO Vodafone Italy and the CFO of Vodafone Business;
 – External cyber threats continue to be a principal risk for the Group. 
Accordingly, the Committee met with the Chief Technology Officer 
and Cyber Security, Technology Assurance and Strategy Director to 
review and challenge the cyber security strategy and undertook 
a deep dive review of this principal risk;
Read more about cyber security  
on pages 46 to 51
 – We performed deep dive reviews on several other principal risks, 
including Supply chain disruption, Data management and privacy, 
Disintermediation and Adverse political and policy environment;
 – At the September 2023 and March 2024 meetings, we considered 
the anticipated financial reporting matters impacting the half-year 
and year-end reporting. We also reviewed the half-year results 
announcement at our November meeting and this Annual Report 
and accompanying materials at our March and May meetings. Our 
work included reviews of the Strategic Report, goodwill impairment 
testing, taxation judgements, legal contingencies and 
the Company’s work on going concern and the long-term viability 
statement.
The Committee recognises the importance of Environmental, Social 
and Governance (‘ESG’) topics and the evolving disclosure 
requirements in this area. During our joint meeting in May 2024, we 
challenged the disclosures included in this Annual Report and also 
the Group’s ESG Addendum, which is available on our website.
Our external auditor, Ernst & Young (‘EY’), provides robust challenge 
to management and its independent view to the Committee on 
specific financial reporting judgements and the control environment.

Financial reporting
The Committee’s primary responsibility in relation to the Group’s

auditor, the appropriateness of the half-year and annual consolidated 
financial statements. The Committee focuses on:
 – The quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;
 – Providing advice to the Board on the form and basis underlying 
the long-term viability statement;
 – Material areas in which significant judgements have been applied 
or where significant issues have been discussed with the external 
auditor;
 – An assessment of whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced, and understandable and whether our US Annual 
Report on Form 20-F complies with relevant US regulations;
 – The clarity of the disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting standards and relevant financial and governance 
reporting requirements; and
 – Any correspondence from regulators in relation to our 
financial reporting.
Accounting policies and practices
The Committee received reports from management in relation to:
 – The identification of critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty, including the impact of climate

Committee approved the disclosures of the accounting policies and 
practices set out in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ and within other notes

Area of focus
Actions taken
Portfolio changes 
The Group announced the disposal of Vodafone Spain in October 
2023 and the disposal of Vodafone Italy in March 2024. Vodafone 
Spain and Vodafone Italy are both material operating segments of 
the Group. Consequently, the results are reported as discontinued 
operations in the year, with comparative information in both the 
income statement and cash flow statement re-presented to reflect 
this classification.
At 31 March 2024, the Group awaits certain regulatory approvals for 
both transactions and therefore the assets and liabilities of Vodafone 
Spain and Vodafone Italy are presented as held for sale. 
See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ in the 
consolidated financial statements. 
The Committee met with the Group Financial Controlling and 
Operations Director in March and May 2024 who outlined the key 
accounting and disclosure impacts in relation to the transactions in 
the consolidated financial statements. 
India accounting matters
The disclosure and accounting judgements in relation to:
 – The Group’s conditional and capped obligations to make certain 
payments to Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) under a payment 
mechanism agreed at the time of the merger between Vodafone 
India and Idea Cellular in 2017; and
 – The valuation of a mark-to-market derivative asset in relation to 
the Total Return Swap (‘TRS’).
See note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’ and note 29 
‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the Group’s 
accounting judgements in relation to potential liabilities under the 
payment mechanism agreed with VIL. 
The Committee also reviewed accounting judgements relating to the 
valuation of the TRS derivative asset. 
These reviews occurred at the September 2023, November 2023, 
March 2024 and May 2024 Committee meetings. 
Impairments
Judgements in relation to impairment testing relate primarily to the 
assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use of the 
Group’s businesses, being the achievability of the long-term business 
plans and the macroeconomic and related valuation model 
assumptions.
See note 4 ‘Impairment losses’ in the consolidated financial 
statements. 
The Committee met with the Group Head of Financial Planning & 
Analysis in November 2023 and May 2024 to discuss the impairment 
exercise undertaken and to challenge the appropriateness of 
assumptions made, including:
 – Management’s valuation methodology;
 – The achievability of the Group’s five-year business plans;
 – The potential impacts of market factors on the Group’s businesses 
and their business plans; 
 – The long-term growth assumed for the Group’s businesses at the 
end of the plan period; and
 – The discount rates assumed in the valuation of the Group’s 
businesses.
Fair, balanced and understandable
The Committee assessed whether the Annual Report, taken as 
a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy. This 
assessment is supported by the Group’s Disclosure Committee, which 
is chaired by the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary who 
briefs the Committee on the Disclosure Committee’s work and 
findings.
The Committee reviewed the processes and controls that underpin 
the Annual Report’s preparation, ensuring that all contributors and 
senior management are fully aware of the requirements and their 
responsibilities. This included the financial reporting responsibilities of 
the Directors under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 to 
promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members 
as well as considering the interests of other stakeholders that will 
have an impact on the Company’s long-term success.
The Committee reviewed an early draft of the Annual Report at its 
March meeting to enable input and comment. The review is 
performed in conjunction with the ESG Committee during the joint 
meeting in May, which also included the review of TCFD and 
ESG-related disclosures. The Committee also reviewed the results 
announcement, supported by the work of the Group’s Disclosure 
Committee, which reviews and assesses the appropriateness of 
investor communications.
This work enabled the Committee to provide positive assurance to the 
Board to assist it in making the statement required by the Code.
Significant financial reporting judgements
The areas considered and actions taken by the Committee in relation 
to the 2024 consolidated financial statements are outlined below and 
overleaf. For each area, the Committee was satisfied with the 
accounting and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

Governance (continued)
Regulators and our financial reporting
The Financial Reporting Council (‘FRC’) publishes thematic reviews 
and other guidance to help companies improve the quality of 
corporate reporting through the provision of guidance and reviews of 
the quality of reporting across public companies. The Group routinely 
reviews FRC publications, the most relevant publications for the 2024 
Annual Report being:
 – Annual review of corporate reporting;
 – Annual review of corporate governance reporting; and
 – Thematic reviews on existing disclosure requirements for (i) IFRS 13 
‘Fair value measurement’ and (ii) Climate-related metrics and 
targets. 
The Group already complied with the majority of the 
recommendations and the 2024 Annual Report has been updated to 
adopt best practice where appropriate.
We reviewed the minimum standard for Audit Committees that was 
published by the FRC in May 2023. The Committee follows the 
working practices in the guidance with necessary disclosure provided 
in the Annual Report. Consequently, the guidance has not resulted in 
any substantive changes for the Committee. 
Draft regulations for new UK corporate reporting requirements were 
withdrawn by the UK Government in October 2023, and it was 
announced that simpler and more targeted reforms will be 
considered in the future. We continue to track developments in this 
area to ensure that we will be well placed to implement any changes, 
as applicable, in the years ahead. 
In January 2024, the FRC published an updated UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘revised Code’). The implementation date will be 
the year ending 31 March 2026 for the Group, excluding the 
enhanced internal control requirements in the revised Code where 
implementation is required for the year ending 31 March 2027. The 
Committee will work with management to identify the scope of our 
material internal controls and the level of internal attestation work 
that will be performed in order to support the Board’s declaration of 
effectiveness of the controls. We expect to leverage from our 
established controls programme, which underpins our existing US 
reporting obligations. 
In January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’) 
raised a comment in relation to the commentary on our financial 
performance that was included in our Form 20-F for the year ended 
31 March 2023. We submitted our written response to the SEC which 
was accepted, and their review was closed in January 2024. This 
review will result in a number of enhancements in our disclosures 
which will be included in our Form 20-F for the year ended 31 March 
2024. 
Area of focus
Actions taken
Liability provisioning
The Group is subject to a range of claims and legal actions from a 
number of sources, including, but not limited to, competitors, 
regulators, customers, suppliers and, on occasion, fellow 
shareholders in Group subsidiaries.
See note 16 ‘Provisions’ and note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’ in the consolidated financial statements. 
The Committee met with the Director of Litigation in November 
2023 and May 2024 in advance of the half-year and year-end 
reporting, respectively. 
The Committee reviewed and challenged management’s assessment 
of the status of the most significant claims, together with relevant 
legal advice received by the Group, to form a view on the level of 
provisioning and appropriateness of disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Taxation
The Group is subject to a range of tax claims and related legal actions  
in several jurisdictions where it operates. Furthermore, the Group has 
extensive accumulated tax losses, and a key management 
judgement is whether a deferred tax asset should be recognised in 
respect of those losses.
See note 6 ’Taxation’ and note 29 ’Contingent liabilities and legal 
proceedings’ in the consolidated financial statements. 
The Committee met with the Group Tax Director in November 2023  
and May 2024 in advance of the half-year and year-end financial 
reporting, respectively. The Committee challenged the judgements 
underpinning tax provisioning, deferred tax assets and related 
disclosures. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue is a risk area given the inherent complexity of IFRS 15 
accounting requirements and the underlying billing and related IT 
systems. 
See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial 
statements.
The accounting policy for and related disclosure requirements of 
IFRS 15 that have been presented in the Annual Report were 
reviewed in March and May 2024. 
The Committee considered the scope of EY’s planned revenue audit 
procedures and their related audit findings and observations at its 
meetings in November 2023 and May 2024.

Internal control and risk management
The Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including the risk management 
framework, the compliance framework and the work of the Internal 
Audit function.
Internal Audit
The Internal Audit function provides independent and objective 
assurance over the design and operating effectiveness of the system 
of internal control, through a risk-based approach. The function 
reports into the Committee and, administratively, to the Chief 
Financial Officer. The function is composed of teams across Group 
functions and local markets. This enables access to specialist skills 
through centres of excellence and ensures local knowledge and 
experience. Cooperation with professional bodies and an information 
technology research firm has ensured access to additional specialist 
skills and an advanced knowledge base.
Internal Audit activities are based on a robust methodology and the 
internal quality assurance improvement programme ensures 
conformity with the International Professional Practices framework, 
which includes the IIA standards and code of ethics and the 
continuous development of the audit methodology applied. The 
conformity is reviewed and verified through an external quality 
assessment by an independent consultancy firm every three years.
The Committee has a standing agenda item to cover Internal 
Audit-related topics. Prior to the start of each financial year, the 
Committee reviews and approves the annual audit plan, assesses the 
adequacy of the budget and resources and reviews the strategic 
initiatives for the continuous improvement of the function’s 
effectiveness. The audit plan is determined by considering Internal 
Audit’s rolling review framework and the outputs of a data-driven risk 
assessment.
The Committee reviews progress against the approved audit plan and 
the results of Internal Audit activities, with a strong focus on 
unsatisfactory audit results and cross-entity audits, which are audits 
that are performed across multiple markets with the same scope. 
Audit results are analysed by process and entity to highlight both 
changes in the control environment and areas that require attention.
During the year, Internal Audit coverage focused on principal risks, 
including Cyber threat, Data management and privacy and Adverse 
macro-economic conditions. 
Through the thematic reviews, assurance was provided across a broad 
range of areas, including: customer device financing; discount 
management; Vodafone Business billing processes; M-Pesa 
operations; security of enterprise customer-provided equipment 
(‘CPE’); management of end-of-life software risks; identity 
management; shadow IT; management of network stock; 
management of payment systems; data privacy; management of 
customer master data; and the physical security of critical assets. The 
activities performed by the shared service organisation continue to 
receive ongoing focus due to their significance across many 
processes.
Management is responsible for ensuring that issues raised by Internal 
Audit are addressed within an agreed timetable, and the Committee 
reviews their timely completion.
The last independent review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
Internal Audit function was performed by Deloitte LLP in January 
2022, and the results were presented to the Committee. The review 
concluded that the Internal Audit function operated in accordance 
with the Global Institute of Internal Auditors’ International 
Professional Practices Framework, is at the top of its peer group range 
and demonstrates areas of innovative practice.
The Internal Audit function continues to invest in several initiatives to 
improve its effectiveness, particularly in the adoption of new 
technologies. The innovative use of data analytics has provided 
broader and deeper audit testing and driven increased insights.
Assessment of the Group’s system of internal control, 
including the risk management framework
The Group’s risk assessment process and the way in which significant 
business risks are managed is an area of focus for the Committee. 
The Committee’s activity here was led primarily, but not solely, by the 
Group’s assessment of its principal and emerging risks and 
uncertainties. Cyber threats remain a major focus for the Committee 
given the continual threats in this area.
The Group has an internal control environment designed to protect 
the business from the material risks that have been identified. 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal controls and the Committee has responsibility for ensuring 
the effectiveness of those controls.
The Committee reviewed the process by which Group management 
assessed the control environment, in accordance with the 
requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control 
and Related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. 
This activity was supported by (i) reports from the Group Audit 
Director, (ii) a review of the Group’s principal risks with the Global 
Head of Risk, (iii) a review of the Group’s second line of defence and 
policy simplification with the Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, and (iv) a fraud update from the Global Corporate Security 
and Resilience Director and Global Head of Fraud Management and 
Investigations. 
The Group operates a ‘Speak Up’ channel that enables employees to 
anonymously raise concerns about possible irregularities. The 
Committee received an update on the operation of the channel 
together with the output of any resulting investigations.
The Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control, including risk management, during 
the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered 
all material controls including financial, operating and compliance 
controls. The Committee confirms that the system of internal control 
operated effectively for the 2024 financial year. Where specific areas 
for improvement were identified, mitigating alternative controls and 
processes were in place. This allows us to provide positive assurance 
to the Board to help fulfil its obligations under the Code.
Compliance with section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Oversight of the Group’s compliance activities in relation to section 
404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act and policy compliance reviews also 
fall within the Committee’s remit.
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal controls over financial reporting, and we have responsibility 
for ensuring the effectiveness of these controls. The Committee 
received updates on the Group’s work in relation to section 404 
compliance and the Group’s broader financial control environment 
during the year. We continue to challenge management on ensuring 
the nature and scope of control activities evolve to ensure key risks 
continue to be adequately mitigated. 
The Committee also took an active role in monitoring the Group’s 
compliance activities, including receiving reports from management 
in the year covering programme-level strategy, the scope of 
compliance work performed and the results of controls testing. The 
external auditor also reports the status of its work in relation to 
controls in its reports to the Committee.

Long-term viability statement and  
going concern assessment
The Committee provides advice to the Board on the form and basis of 
conclusion underlying the long-term viability statement and the 
going concern assessment.
Read more about the long-term 
viability statement on page 63
Read more about the going concern 
assessment on page 124
At our meeting in May 2024, the Committee challenged management 
on its financial risk assessment as part of its consideration of the 
long-term viability statement. This included scrutiny of forecast 
liquidity, balance sheet stress tests, the availability of cash and cash 
equivalents through new or existing financing facilities and a review of 
counter-party risk to assess the likelihood of third parties not being 
able to meet contractual obligations. This comprehensive assessment 
of the Group’s prospects made by management included 
consideration of:
 – The review period and alignment with the Group’s internal 
long-term forecasts;
 – The assessment of the capacity of the Group to remain viable after 
consideration of future cash flows, expected debt service 
requirements, undrawn facilities and access to capital markets;
 – The modelling of the financial impact of severe but plausible risk 
scenarios materialising; including a sensitivity if expected M&A 
transactions fail to complete within the assessment period;
 – The inclusion of clear and enhanced disclosures in the Annual 
Report as to why the assessment period selected was appropriate 
to the Group, what qualifications and assumptions were made and 
how the underlying analysis was performed, consistent with 
FRC pronouncements; and
 – Comprehensive disclosure in relation to the Group’s liquidity 
provided in the consolidated financial statements. See note 22 
‘Capital and financial risk management’ in the consolidated 
financial statements.
External audit
The Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the 
relationship with the external auditor, EY. This includes making the 
recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and removal 
of the external auditor, assessing its independence on an ongoing 
basis, and approving the statutory audit fee, the scope of the statutory 
audit and the appointment of the lead audit engagement partner. 
Alison Duncan has held this role for five years since the appointment 
of EY as external auditor for the year ended 31 March 2020. The lead 
audit partner role will rotate to Michael Rudberg, an existing partner 
on the audit team, for the year ending 31 March 2025.
EY presented to the Committee its detailed audit plan for the 2024 
financial year, which outlined its audit scope, planning materiality and 
its assessment of key audit risks. The identification of key audit risks is 
critical in the overall effectiveness of the external audit process and 
these are outlined in the Auditor’s report.
The Committee also received reports from EY on its assessment 
of the accounting and disclosures in the financial statements and 
financial controls.
The last external audit tender took place in 2019, which resulted in 
the appointment of EY. The Committee will continue to review the 
auditor appointment and anticipates that the audit will be put out to 
tender at least every 10 years. In deciding when to conduct an 
external audit tender, the Committee considers a range of factors, 
including the potential cost and efficiency benefits of retaining the 
incumbent auditor. The Company has complied with the Statutory 
Audit Services Order 2014 for the financial year under review. 
Read the Auditor’s report  
on pages 125 to 134
Independence and objectivity
In its assessment of the independence of the auditor, and in 
accordance with the US Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board’s (‘PCAOB’) standard on independence, the Committee received 
details of all relationships between the Company and EY that may 
have a bearing on its independence and received confirmation from 
EY that it is independent of the Company in accordance with US 
federal securities law and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
SEC and the PCAOB.
Effectiveness of the external audit process
The Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit process 
throughout the year and considered the performance of EY. 
This comprised the Committee’s own assessment and the results of a 
detailed feedback survey of senior personnel across the Group. Based 
on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been 
appropriate focus and challenge by EY on the primary areas of the 
audit and that EY had applied robust challenge and scepticism 
throughout the audit.
EY audit and non-audit fees
Total fees payable to EY for audit and non-audit services in the year 
ended 31 March 2024 amounted to €36 million (FY23: €31 million).
Audit fees
The Committee reviewed and discussed the fee proposal, was 
engaged in agreeing audit scope changes and, following the receipt 
of formal assurance that its fees were appropriate for the scope of the 
work required, agreed an audit fee of €26 million for statutory audit 
services in the year (FY23: €28 million).
Non-audit fees
To protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, 
the Committee has a policy for the engagement of the external 
auditor to provide non-audit services. The policy prohibits EY from 
playing any part in management or decision-making, providing certain 
services such as valuation work and the provision of accounting 
services. The Group’s non-audit services policy incorporates the 
requirements of the FRC’s Ethical Standard, including a ‘whitelist’ of 
permitted non-audit services which mirrors the FRC’s Ethical Standard.
The FRC published a revised Ethical Standard in January 2024. The 
Group’s non-audit services policy will be updated to incorporate the 
changes in the revised Ethical Standard and will be approved by the 
Committee ahead of the December 2024 effective date. 
The Committee has pre-approved that EY can be engaged by 
management, subject to the policies set out above, and subject to:
 – A €60,000 fee limit for individual engagements;
 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no legal 
alternative; and
 – A €500,000 total fee limit for services where there is no practical 
alternative supplier.
For those permitted services that exceed these specified fee limits, 
the Committee Chair pre-approves the service.
Non-audit fees were €10 million (FY23: €3 million). The level of 
non-audit fees in the year ended 31 March 2024 is significantly higher 
than recent years. This is primarily attributable to Reporting 
Accountant services that have been provided by EY in connection 
with the proposed merger of Vodafone UK with Three UK and other 
audit-related services associated with the disposal of Vodafone Spain.

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Vodafone’s 
Technology Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2024.
The Committee was established in 2023 with the founding members 
bringing a wide range of experience across domains that relate to 
technology and strategy.
This year, the Committee met three times, in July 2023, November 
2023 and January 2024. Each meeting agenda included a range of 
topics across the Committee’s areas of responsibility.
An important objective of the Committee is to provide external 
perspectives and challenge into the technology strategy and 
direction. Furthermore, topics reviewed during Committee meetings 
in 2023/2024 on key areas such as future network strategy, Internet 
of Things ecosystem, Artificial Intelligence (‘AI’) and how technology 
strategy underpins the company strategy, have enabled Committee 
members to lead and support broader technical discussions with the 
main Plc Board.
I have reported this year’s Committee work to the Board and I am 
looking forward to the next year chairing the Committee, starting 
with the next meeting in May 2024.

Focus during the year
The Technology Committee met with senior leaders of the 
technology team including the Chief Technology Officer, Chief 
Network Officer and others on three occasions during the year 
ended 31 March 2024. The following provides a summary of the 
topics covered.
July 2023
In the first meeting the proposed terms of reference were reviewed 
and approved. The objective of this session was to set the foundation 
and context for future discussion and deep dive topics that directly 
support Vodafone’s technology strategy and vision.
Vodafone’s approach to technology strategy development and its 
operating model were explained. 
The Committee discussed Vodafone’s five-year technology strategy 
and individual workstreams. 5G network deployment and the 
development of global platforms were particular areas of focus. Cyber 
security was also discussed, with the Committee reflecting on the 
changing business, technology, and threat landscape. 
November 2023
This session included deep dives on a range of topics including the 
prioritisation process that drives execution of the technology strategy 
and its links to the company’s annual planning cycle.
We discussed how strategy and plans are shaped to address 
regulatory changes, macro-economic and geopolitical factors.
A digital and IT presentation focused on customer experience and 
service as well as global platforms.
January 2024
In January this year, we explored how the technology team is 
supporting Vodafone Business’ growth ambitions over the next five 
years, including target outcomes. Our IoT portfolio and underlying 
technologies were also discussed, including the future investment 
roadmap for key products. 
Priorities, delivery targets and outcomes for FY25 were discussed with 
the Committee with focus on direct contribution to company 
priorities around Customer, Simplicity and Growth.
Finally, the Committee were briefed on Vodafone’s AI, Machine 
Learning and Generative AI capabilities and partnerships ahead of a 
deep dive scheduled for May 2024.
Key focus for the next year
Next year we expect to continue to look at existing and new 
technologies that drive innovation, company strategy and growth, 
focusing on how technology enables customer service and builds 
trust. Strategy discussions will consider how we manage both 
opportunities and risks.

Letter from Committee Chair
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present Vodafone’s ESG 
Committee report for the year ended 31 March 2024. 
On establishment of the Committee in 2021, I was appointed as Chair 
due to my experience in ESG topics and my tenure as a member of 
the Board of Trustees of the Vodafone Foundation since 2020. In 
November 2022, we were delighted to welcome a new Committee 
member, Simon Segars, who brings a wealth of experience from his 
career in the electrical engineering field to the Vodafone Board and 
the ESG Committee. In 2023, the Committee underwent a substantial 
change to its structure, as two of my fellow founding members, Dame 
Clara Furse and Valerie Gooding, retired from the Committee after 
building a strong foundation from which our new members will drive 
the strategy to the next phase. 
To emphasise ESG as a strategic priority, our Board Chair, Jean-
François van Boxmeer, joined the ESG Committee, in addition to his 
role on the Nominations and Governance Committee. Jean-François 
was Chief Executive of Heineken for 15 years and provides important 
perspectives having held senior roles across Africa and Europe before 
becoming Chair of the Vodafone Board in 2020. 
Christine Ramon completes the ESG Committee. Her extensive 
experience in senior finance roles, specifically at AngloGold Ashanti, 
energy and chemicals company Sasol, and as non-executive director 
at telecommunications company MTN Group Ltd, both in South Africa, 
offer invaluable insights to many markets in which Vodafone operates. 
Her position on the ARC ensures that where ESG concepts converge 
with risk and compliance topics, we can take an integrated approach. 
In FY23, the Board took the decision to evolve ESG governance and 
increase the cadence of ESG Committee meetings to three per 
annum. This additional engagement is a joint session with the ARC, to 
stay ahead of the constantly changing ESG landscape, ensure a 
holistic perspective on the issues that impact both committees and 
implement additional controls on disclosures, within the Annual 
Report and the ESG Addendum and Methodology document,  
for which we have introduced a collaborative responsibility. 
The other two Committee meetings in FY23 ensured further 
development of the relationships with the senior leaders who lead the 
Purpose agenda, drive the strategies to deliver against the KPIs and 
engage Vodafone employees in supporting positive change in all ESG 
areas. The wide variety of topics and thorough papers ensured a 
comprehensive view of the ESG programmes. Deep dives with subject 
matter experts were conducted to develop detailed knowledge on 
specific strategies, KPIs and progress against them along with 
discussions around future direction.
Multiple discussions with Joakim Reiter, Chief External and Corporate 
Affairs Officer, have reinforced that ESG is at the core of Vodafone’s 
purpose and is a key element in the execution of the corporate 
strategy, as well as a driver of commercial success. The approach to 
ESG brings together five key programmes:
 – Purpose and the actions Vodafone takes within our Purpose 
strategy relating to Empowering People, Protecting the Planet 
and Maintaining Trust;
 – Oversight of Vodafone’s ESG strategy and performance to 
ensure an effective ESG programme;
 – Conducting business with integrity, to ensure Vodafone 
operates to the highest possible standards of integrity and ethics, 
and that Vodafone is ‘Doing What’s Right’ towards customers, 
colleagues, communities and co-partners;
 – Transparency, including providing correct disclosures and 
reporting, as well as external positioning, engagement and 
communication on all material ESG aspects; and
 – Measurement, ensuring that the data that we use to track 
progress on ESG metrics is of high quality and reliable, to provide 
insights for strategic focus. 
The transformation programme to move ESG data reporting to the 
finance function continues to evolve and support the delivery of 
substantial improvements in our non-financial data through the 
development of a robust control environment, alongside policies, to 
progress our ESG objectives. 
On behalf of the Committee, I have reported on the FY24 work to the Board, 
and I am looking forward to FY25; starting with the joint ESG and ARC 
Committee meeting in May 2024 to review annual reporting. 
The Committee will continue oversight and scrutiny of Vodafone’s 
ESG agenda, including further presentations from senior executives 
and experts from across the Group. We will review progress on each of 
Vodafone’s ESG strategies and the pathways in place to meet our ESG 
goals in Group and across markets. Consideration of the following 
stakeholder interests will remain part of the Committee’s responsibility:
 – Investors: Strong Board-level ESG governance is a key 
requirement of an effective ESG programme;
 – Governments and regulators: Local and international legal and 
regulatory obligations on ESG topics continue to increase;
 – Local communities and NGOs: ESG topics affect the day-to-day 
lives of the people in the communities that we serve;
 – Suppliers and customers: Upholding high ethical standards 
throughout our value chain is critical for stakeholders when 
deciding whether they should do business with Vodafone; and
 – Employees take pride in working for a purpose-driven organisation 
that is enabling an inclusive, sustainable and trusted digital society.

Focus during the year
The ESG Committee met three times during the year ended 31 March 
2024. The following provides a summary of the topics covered.
May 2023 
The inaugural joint ARC and ESG Committee provided a full review of 
all ESG annual reporting documents, including the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) report and the ESG 
Addendum. The Committees received papers outlining key changes 
made since the previous annual report, including the strategic approach 
and the scope of the assurance plan. The Committees were satisfied 
with the proposals. 
November 2023
 – Review of the ESG strategy and its evolution since the 
establishment of the Committee in 2021. The paper submitted by 
Joakim Reiter, Chief External and Corporate Affairs Officer, provided 
details on three key strategic evolutions prompted either by changes in 
Vodafone Group or developments in the external environment: 
simplification of ESG targets, integration of ESG into business 
priorities, and the continued evolution of ESG data management. 
 – The Executive Committee sponsor of Vodafone’s inclusion 
programme, Serpil Timuray, CEO of Vodafone Investments, 
provided an overview of the strategy and a progress update on KPIs 
in relation to customers, communities, colleagues and co-partners. 
 – Leanne Wood, Chief Human Resources Officer, presented feedback 
from Vodafone’s female employees on the gender diversity 
programme, the achievements to date and the actions planned to 
further improve the gender diversity programme. 
 – The Committee was also assured by the papers submitted on ESG 
rankings and indices and the approach to ESG half-year reporting. 
March 2024
Joakim Reiter, delivered key ESG developments at the March Committee:
 – Vodafone’s purpose was refreshed to reflect that everything we do 
in Vodafone aims to create a digital society, and we ensure that this 
digital society is inclusive, sustainable and responsible through 
three purpose differentiators: Empowering People, Protecting the 
Planet and Maintaining Trust. 
 – The Committee welcomed the opportunity to review Vodafone’s 
Climate Transition Plan, which details the necessary actions to 
achieve our net zero ambitions. This will be published as part of our 
FY24 reporting suite, and is a summary of our strategy with 
cross-functional objectives and governance to reduce emissions 
and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities. 
 – Vodafone’s approach to ESG reporting for FY24 was noted in a 
paper along with the results from a recent internal audit that 
reviewed: ESG global targets; policies and procedures; 
implementation and monitoring of programmes; local metrics 
calculation and reporting; and Group consolidation and disclosures. 
Key focus for the next year
 – Continuing to review progress of the ESG strategy, including performance 
against targets and performance in ESG indices and rankings;
 – Reviewing progress in embedding key purpose targets and 
practices into Vodafone’s operations and commercial strategy;
 – Reviewing Vodafone’s alignment to external ESG disclosure standards 
such as ISRS1, CSRD2 and ESRS3; and
 – Continued oversight of the ESG data management programme.

Letter from the Remuneration  
Committee Chair 
On behalf of the Board, I present our 2024  
Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
This report includes both our Policy Report (as approved by 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM), and our 2024 Annual Report on 
Remuneration, which sets out how our policy was implemented during 
the year under review and how it will be applied for the year ahead.
Activities during the year
In the last year we have seen good progress in delivering against our 
strategic goals of Customers, Simplicity, and Growth, and in 
transforming our company to support these ambitions. We recognise 
how important it is to stay connected with our employees during this 
period of change, and as a result continue to collect feedback 
through our Spirit Beat survey and other employee listening 
initiatives. Our workforce engagement leads, Christine Ramon and 
Delphine Ernotte Cunci, have also attended forums in Europe and 
Africa to understand the perspectives of employees across all our 
markets. The key topics raised by employee representatives this year 
included our company transformation, market portfolio, the 
development of our employees, and the experience of our customers.
As set out in last year’s letter, we launched our remuneration policy 
consultation with our largest shareholders last year and engaged 
with a variety of investor bodies and proxy agencies. We were 
pleased to see that our Policy Report was approved by over 95% of 
shareholders at the 2023 AGM. The Committee would like to thank 
those that provided feedback leading up to this and we continue 
to engage with investors on the implementation of our 2024 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Alignment with our strategy and culture
During the year we made announcements regarding the sale of 
Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy and outlined the binding 
agreement to combine our UK business. These reflect the 
advancements we have made in right-sizing our European portfolio 
for optimal growth. We also made good early progress with improving 
the experience of customers and transforming our operations to 
remove complexity and accelerate growth.
To support and reinforce these priorities, we updated the structure of 
our Global Short Term Incentive plan to categorise measures under 
Growth and Customers. In the case of the latter, we split out our NPS, 
Churn and Revenue Market Share metrics into separate measures, 
following the previous approach of categorising these under a single 
Customer Appreciation metric. This has ensured dedicated focus, and, 
in the case of NPS, where we specifically review the reduction of deep 
detractor customers, we have seen a reduction in a majority of our markets.
We continue to use adjusted free cash flow across our incentive plans 
to reinforce the importance of cash generation in creating value for 
our business and when applying rigorous capital discipline in investment 
decisions. We also use adjusted service revenue and adjusted EBIT in 
our Global Short Term Incentive plan to focus on the importance of 
delivering operating efficiencies when maximising profit and revenue.
The Committee evaluates the remuneration decisions, outcomes, and 
structures in the context of our evolving company strategy, and this 
will inform any changes to our Policy Report which will be reviewed in 
the forthcoming year.

on pages 9 and 80 of this Annual Report
Fair pay
During the year we continued to make interventions across our 
business to support our colleagues in countries where inflationary 
and cost of living pressures were being felt. This included targeted 
support in markets including, but not limited to, Germany, Ireland, 
Egypt, and Turkey. The type of support used was tailored to specific 
market circumstances but included additional or accelerated salary 
reviews and the provision of extra cash allowances.
When making decisions on executive remuneration the Committee 
considers pay in the wider context including arrangements elsewhere 
in the business, our fair pay principles and stakeholder considerations.

Arrangements for 2025
Base salary and pension arrangements
Prior to the 2024 review, the salaries for both Executive Directors had 
been unchanged following their respective appointments to the roles 
of Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer.
Following the 2024 salary review, the Committee agreed that 
salaries for both Executive Directors would remain unchanged. 
The Committee felt this was appropriate considering Margherita 
Della Valle’s salary increase following her permanent appointment 
as Group Chief Executive in April 2023, and given Luka Mucic’s salary 
was set appropriately when he joined as Chief Financial Officer in 
September 2023. 
Pension arrangements for Executive Directors will continue to remain 
aligned with the wider UK workforce at 10% of base salary.
Annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)
During the year the Committee determined that measures and 
weighting under the 2025 annual bonus will remain unchanged from 
those used in the 2024 plan:
 – Growth (70%): service revenue (20%), adjusted EBIT (20%), 
adjusted free cash flow (20%) and revenue market share (10%).
 – Customers (30%): Net Promoter Score (20%) and churn (10%).
Global long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
The Committee determined that the GLTI will remain unchanged for 
2025. The measures under the long-term incentive will continue to 
be weighted at 60% adjusted free cash flow, 30% relative TSR and 
10% ESG.

Performance outcomes during 2024
GSTIP performance (1 April 2023 – 31 March 2024)
Annual bonus performance during the year was measured against 
both financial and strategic measures aligned to our strategic 
priorities of Growth and Customers. The four measures underpinning 
Growth, equivalent to 70% of the award, include service revenue 
(20%), adjusted EBIT (20%), adjusted free cash flow (20%), and 
revenue market share (10%). The measures under the Customers 
element of the award, equivalent to 30% of the award, include Net 
Promoter Score (20%) and Churn (10%).
Performance under the financial and strategic measures was 
consistent with or above the mid-point of the target range. The 
combined performance resulted in an overall bonus payout of 71.2% 
of maximum.

GLTI performance (1 April 2021 – 31 March 2024)
The 2022 GLTI award (granted August 2021) was subject to adjusted free cash flow (‘FCF’) (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), 
and ESG (10% of total award) performance. All performance conditions were measured over the three-year period ending 31 March 2024.
Final adjusted FCF performance finished above the mid-point of the range resulting in 65.3% of the adjusted FCF element vesting. Relative TSR 
performance was below the median of the peer group resulting in no vesting under this measure. ESG performance was assessed against three 
metrics and vested at 96.9%. This resulted in an overall vesting percentage for the 2021 GLTI of 48.9% of maximum.

Consideration of discretion
The Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the outcomes of both the annual bonus and long-term incentive plan in light of both the 
relevant performance targets and wider internal and external considerations, including the wider employee experience, across the respective 
measurement periods. The Committee also acknowledged that no windfall gains had occurred under the long-term incentive plan. It was agreed 
that the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required.
Looking ahead
Over the course of the next 12 months the Committee will be reviewing the current Remuneration Policy to ensure it continues to support our 
Company strategy. If any necessary changes are required, these will be shared for consultation ahead of the Policy Report being finalised for 
approval.
The rest of this report sets out both our Policy Report, as approved at the 2023 AGM, and our Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out the 
decisions and outcomes summarised in this letter in further detail.

Remuneration Policy 
Remuneration Policy – notes to reader 
No changes have been made to our policy since its approval at the 2023 Annual General Meeting which was held on 25 July 2023. Our approved 
Policy Report is available on our website at vodafone.com, and has been reproduced below in the shaded boxes exactly as it was set out in the 
2023 Annual Report. As such some of the policy wording, including references to the 2023 Annual General Meeting and page number references, 
is now out of date. 
Remuneration Policy
In this forward-looking section we describe our Remuneration Policy for the Board. This includes our considerations when determining policy, 
a description of the elements of the reward package, including an indication of the potential future value of this package for the Executive 
Directors, and the policy applied to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors.
We will be seeking shareholder approval for our Remuneration Policy at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) and we intend to implement 
it at that point. A summary and explanation of the proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy is provided on page 85. The proposed 
Remuneration Policy submitted for shareholders’ approval at the 2023 AGM does not differ substantively from the Remuneration Policy 
approved by shareholders in 2020 except for changes made to align the terms of the Remuneration Policy with the drafting of the rules of the 
new Global Incentive Plan 2023, which is also being submitted for shareholders’ approval at the 2023 AGM. Subject to approval, we will review 
our Remuneration Policy each year to ensure that it continues to support our Company strategy and, if it is necessary to make a change to our 
Remuneration Policy within the next three years, we will seek prior shareholder approval for the change.
Considerations when determining our Remuneration Policy
To avoid conflicts of interest, the Remuneration Committee is entirely comprised of Non-Executive Directors (who are not eligible to 
participate in the Company’s annual bonus or long-term incentive arrangements) and the Remuneration Committee ensures that individuals 
are not present when the Remuneration Committee discusses their own remuneration. A critical consideration for the Remuneration 
Committee when determining our Remuneration Policy is to ensure that it supports our Company purpose, strategy, and business objectives.
A variety of stakeholder views are taken into account when determining executive pay, including those of our shareholders, colleagues, and 
external bodies. Further details of how we engage with, and consider the views of, each of these stakeholders are set out on page 100.
In advance of submitting our Remuneration Policy for shareholder approval we ran a thorough consultation exercise with our major 
shareholders. We invited our top 25 shareholders (constituting a combined holding of c.50% of our issued share capital at the time of 
engagement) and a number of key governance stakeholders to comment on remuneration at Vodafone and to provide feedback on the 
proposed changes to the current Remuneration Policy which was approved at the 2020 AGM. A number of meetings between shareholders 
and the Remuneration Committee Chair took place during this consultation period. 
Listening to and consulting with our employees is very important and the Remuneration Committee is supportive of the activities undertaken 
to engage the employee voice. Our engagement with employees can take different forms in different markets but includes a variety of 
channels and approaches including our annual people survey which attracts very high levels of participation and engagement, regular 
business leader Q&A sessions, and a number of internal digital communication platforms.
Our Workforce Engagement Lead also undertakes an annual attendance at our European employee forum, and a similar body which covers 
our African markets, with any questions or concerns raised by the employee representatives presented directly to the Board for consideration 
and discussion. Any actions taken by the Board are then fed back to these forums to ensure a two-way dialogue.
Whilst we do not formally consult directly with employees on the Remuneration Policy nor is any fixed remuneration comparison 
measurement used when determining the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is briefed on pay and 
employment conditions of employees in the Vodafone Group, with particular reference to the market in which the executive is based. The 
Company operates Sharesave, a UK all-employee share plan, as well as other discretionary share-based incentive arrangements, which means 
that the wider workforce have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company and be able to vote on the Remuneration Policy in the 
same way as other shareholders. Further information on our approach to remuneration for other employees is given on page 90.
Performance measures and targets
Our Company strategy and business objectives are the primary consideration when we are selecting performance measures for our incentive 
plans. The targets within our incentive plans that are related to internal financial measures (such as revenue, profit and cash flow) are typically 
determined based on our budgets. Targets for strategic and external measures (such as customer-focused metrics, ESG measures, and total 
shareholder return (‘TSR’)) are set based on Company objectives and in light of the competitive marketplace. The threshold and maximum 
levels of performance are set to reflect minimum acceptable levels at threshold and very stretching levels at maximum.
As in previous Remuneration Reports, we will disclose the details of our performance metrics for our short- and long-term incentive plans. 
However, our annual bonus targets are commercially sensitive and therefore we will only disclose our targets in the Remuneration Report 
following the completion of the financial year. We will normally disclose the targets for each long-term award in the Remuneration Report for 
the financial year preceding the start of the performance period.
At the end of each performance period we review performance against the targets, using judgement to account for items such as (but not 
limited to) mergers, acquisitions, disposals, foreign exchange rate movements, changes in accounting treatment, material one-off tax 
settlements etc. The application of judgement is important to ensure that the final assessments of performance are fair and appropriate.

The Remuneration Policy table 
The table below summarises the main components of the reward package for Executive Directors.
Fixed pay: Base salary
Purpose and link 
to strategy
To attract and retain the best talent
Operation
Salaries are usually reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months commencing 1 July. Decisions are influenced by:
 – the level of skill, experience and scope of responsibilities;
 – business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market conditions;
 – increases elsewhere within the Group; and
 – external comparator groups (which are used for reference purposes only) made up of companies of similar size 
and complexity to Vodafone.
Opportunity
Average salary increases for existing Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) will not normally 
exceed average increases for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. Increases above this level may be 
made in specific situations. These situations could include (but are not limited to) internal promotions, changes to 
role, material changes to the business and exceptional Company performance.
Performance metrics
None.
Fixed pay: Pension
Purpose and link 
to strategy
To remain competitive within the marketplace
Operation
 – Executive Directors may choose to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme or to receive a cash 
allowance in lieu of pension.
Opportunity
 – The pension contribution or cash payment is equal to the maximum employer contribution available to our UK 
employees under our Defined Contribution scheme (currently 10% of annual gross salary).
Performance metrics
None.
Fixed pay: Benefits
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To aid retention and remain competitive within the marketplace
Operation
 – Travel-related benefits. These may include (but are not limited to) a company car or cash allowance, fuel and 
access to a driver where appropriate.
 – Private medical, death and disability insurance and annual health checks for the Executive Directors and their 
families.
 – In the event that we ask an individual to relocate we would offer them support in line with Vodafone’s relocation 
and international assignment policies. This may cover (but is not limited to) relocation, cost of living allowance, 
housing, home leave, education support, and tax equalisation and advice.
 – Legal and tax support fees if appropriate.
 – Other benefits are also offered in line with the benefits offered to other employees, for example, our all-employee 
share plan, mobile phone discounts, maternity/paternity benefits, sick leave, paid holiday etc.
Opportunity
 – Benefits will be provided in line with appropriate levels indicated by local market practice in the country of 
employment, though no monetary maximum has been set.
 – We expect to maintain benefits at the current level but the value of any benefit may fluctuate depending on, 
amongst other things, personal situation, insurance premiums and other external factors.
Performance metrics
None.
Malus and clawback 
The Remuneration Committee reviews the incentive plan results before any payments are made to executives or any shares vest and has full 
discretion to adjust the final payment or vesting if they believe circumstances warrant it. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to use either malus or clawback as it sees appropriate. In the case of malus, the award may lapse wholly or in part, may vest to a 
lesser extent than it would otherwise have vested or vesting may be delayed.
In the case of clawback, the Remuneration Committee may recover bonus amounts that have been paid up to three years after the relevant 
payment date, or recover share awards that have vested up to five years after the relevant grant date. In line with best practice guidance, the 
key trigger events for the use of the clawback arrangements include material misstatement of results, material miscalculation of performance 
condition outcomes, the Executive Director’s gross misconduct, or breach of their restrictive covenants, the Executive Director causing a 
material financial loss to the Group as a result of reckless or negligent conduct or inappropriate values or behaviour, corporate failure or 
serious reputational damage.
Subject to approval of this Remuneration Policy, these arrangements will be applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, 
following the 2023 AGM. The current clawback arrangements, which are set out in the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 
2020 AGM, have been applicable to all bonus amounts paid, or share awards granted, since the 2020 AGM.

Annual bonus – Global Short-Term Incentive Plan (‘GSTIP’)
Purpose and link 
to strategy
To drive behaviour and communicate the key priorities for the year.
To motivate employees and incentivise delivery of performance over the one-year operating cycle.
The financial metrics drive our growth strategies whilst also focusing on improving operating efficiencies.
The strategic measures aim to ensure a great customer experience remains at the heart of what we do. 
Operation
 – Bonus levels and the appropriateness of measures and weightings are reviewed annually to ensure they continue 
to support our strategy.
 – Performance over the financial year is measured against stretching financial and non-financial performance 
targets set at the start of the financial year.
 – The annual bonus is usually paid in cash in June each year for performance over the previous year. A mandatory 
deferral of 25% of post-tax bonus earned into shares for two years will normally apply except where an Executive 
Director has met or exceeded their share ownership requirement. The Remuneration Committee retains the 
discretion to adjust the size of the bonus based on the achievement of the relevant performance conditions to 
reflect the Company’s and the Executive Director’s underlying performance and any other factors the 
Remuneration Committee considers appropriate.
Opportunity
 – Bonuses can range from 0 to 200% of base salary, with 100% paid for on-target performance.
Performance metrics
 – Performance over each financial year is measured against stretching targets set at the beginning of the year.
 – The performance measures normally comprise a mix of financial and strategic measures. Financial measures may 
include (but are not limited to) profit, revenue and cash flow with a weighting of no less than 50%. Strategic 
measures may include (but are not limited to) customer appreciation KPIs such as churn, revenue market share, 
and NPS.
Long-term incentive – Global Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘GLTI’)
Purpose and link  
to strategy
To motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained performance over the long term.
To support and encourage greater shareholder alignment through a high level of personal 
share ownership.
The use of free cash flow as the principal performance measure ensures we apply prudent cash 
management and rigorous capital discipline to our investment decisions.
The use of TSR along with a performance period of not less than three years means that we are focused 
on the long-term interests of our shareholders.
The use of ESG metrics reflects the importance of our performance and progress against our long-term 
ambitions in this area.
Operation
 – Award levels and the framework for determining vesting are reviewed annually.
 – Long-term incentive awards consist of awards of shares subject to performance conditions which are granted in 
respect of any financial year.
 – Awards will vest based on Group performance against the performance metrics set out below, measured over a 
period of normally not less than three years. In exceptional circumstances, such as but not limited to where a 
delay to the grant date is required, the Remuneration Committee may set a vesting period of less than three years, 
although awards will continue to be subject to a performance period of at least three years.
 – Awards may be subject to a mandatory two-year post-vesting holding period before the underlying shares can be sold.
 – Dividend equivalents are paid in cash and/or shares by reference to the vesting period (and holding period, if 
applicable) in respect of shares that vest. 
Opportunity
 – Maximum long-term incentive face value at award of 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% for 
other Executive Directors in respect of any financial year.
 – Threshold long-term incentive face value at award is 20% of maximum opportunity. Minimum vesting is 0% of 
maximum opportunity. Awards vest on a straight-line basis between threshold and maximum.
 – The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adjust the extent to which an award vests based on the 
achievement of the relevant performance conditions and to reflect the Company’s and Executive Director’s 
underlying performance and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to reduce long-term incentive grant levels for Executive Directors 
who have neither met their shareholding guideline nor increased their shareholding by 100% of salary during the year.
Performance metrics
 – Performance is measured against stretching targets set at the time of grant.
 – Vesting is determined based on the following measures: adjusted free cash flow as our operational performance 
measure, relative TSR against a peer group of companies as our external performance measure, and ESG as a 
measure of our external impact and commitment to our purpose.
 – Weightings will be determined each year and will normally constitute 60% on adjusted free cash flow, 30% on 
relative total shareholder return, and 10% on ESG. The Remuneration Committee will determine the actual 
weighting of an award prior to grant, taking into account all relevant information.

Notes to the Remuneration Policy table
Existing arrangements
We will honour existing awards, incentives, benefits and contractual arrangements made to individuals prior to their promotion to the Board 
and/or prior to the approval and implementation of this Remuneration Policy. For the avoidance of doubt this includes payments in respect of 
any award granted under any previous Remuneration Policy. This will last until the existing incentives vest (or lapse) or the benefits or 
contractual arrangements no longer apply.
Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’)
When referring to our long-term incentive awards we use the financial year end in which the award was made. For example, the “2023 award” 
was made in the financial year ending 31 March 2023. The awards are usually made in the first half of the financial year.
The extent to which awards vest depends on three performance conditions:
 – underlying operational performance as measured by adjusted free cash flow;
 – relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against a peer group median; and
 – performance against our Environmental, Social, and Governance (‘ESG’) targets.
Further details of these performance conditions are set out below. The Remuneration Committee reserves the right during the lifetime of the 
Remuneration Policy to change the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards to other financial, shareholder return and strategic 
metrics, if the Remuneration Committee determines that to do so would be in the best interests of the Company. However, in such 
circumstances, the majority of the GLTI awards would continue to remain subject to financial performance targets. The Remuneration 
Committee would engage with major shareholders prior to changing the performance conditions applicable to GLTI awards in this way.
Adjusted free cash flow
The free cash flow performance is based on the cumulative adjusted free cash flow figure over the performance period. The detailed targets 
and the definition of adjusted free cash flow are determined each year as appropriate. The target adjusted free cash flow level is set by 
reference to our long-range plan and market expectations. The Remuneration Committee sets these targets to be sufficiently demanding and 
with significant stretch.
The cumulative adjusted free cash flow vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table 
below (with linear interpolation between points):
Performance
Vesting percentage 
(% of FCF element) 
Below threshold
0%
Threshold
20%
Maximum
100%
Relative TSR
We have a limited number of appropriate peers and this makes the measurement of a relative ranking system volatile. As such, the 
outperformance of the median of a peer group is felt to be the most appropriate TSR measure. The peer group and outperformance range for 
the performance condition are reviewed each year and amended as appropriate.
The TSR vesting levels as a percentage of the award subject to this performance element are shown in the table below (with linear 
interpolation between points):

Threshold (median)

Maximum (outperformance of median as determined per award)
100%
In order to determine the percentages for the equivalent outperformance levels above median, the Remuneration Committee seeks 
independent external advice.
ESG performance
Our ESG targets are set on an annual basis (in accordance with our approach for our other performance measures) and are aligned to our 
externally communicated ambitions in this area. Where performance is below the agreed ambition, the Remuneration Committee will use its 
discretion to assess vesting based on performance against the stated ambition and any other relevant information.
Remuneration policy for other employees
While our remuneration policy follows the same fundamental principles across the Group, packages offered to employees reflect differences 
in market practice in the different countries, role and seniority.
For example, the remuneration package elements for our Executive Committee are essentially the same as for the Executive Directors with 
some minor differences, for example smaller levels of share awards and local variances where appropriate. The remuneration for the next level 
of management, our Senior Leadership Team, again follows the same principles with local and/or individual performance aspects in the annual 
bonus targets and GLTI awards. They also receive lower levels of share awards which are partly delivered in conditional share awards without 
performance conditions.

Estimates of total future potential remuneration from 2024 pay packages
The tables below provide estimates of the potential future remuneration for Executive Directors based on the remuneration opportunity to be 
granted in the 2024 financial year. Potential outcomes based on different performance scenarios are provided in accordance with the relevant 
regulatory requirements.
The assumptions underlying each scenario are described below.
Fixed
Consists of base salary, benefits and pension.
Base salary is at 1 July 2023.
Benefits are valued using the figures in the total remuneration for the 2023 financial year table on page 94 (of the 2023 annual report).
Pensions are valued by applying cash allowance rate of 10% of base salary at 1 July 2023.

Mid-point
Based on what a Director would receive if performance was in line with the Company’s business plan.
The opportunity for the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) is 100% of base salary under this scenario.
The opportunity for the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects assumed achievement mid-way between threshold and 
maximum performance.
Maximum
The maximum award opportunity for the GSTIP is 200% of base salary.
The maximum GLTI opportunity reflects full vesting based on the maximum award levels set out in this Remuneration Policy 
(i.e. 500% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 450% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer). 
Maximum 
+50%
The same assumptions apply as for ‘Maximum’ but with a 50% uplift in the value of the GLTI award.
All scenarios
Long-term incentives consist of share awards only which are measured at face value, i.e. no assumption is made for dividend 
equivalents which may be payable.

Recruitment remuneration
Our approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary and appropriate to attract the right talent to the role.
The Remuneration Policy table (pages 88 and 89) sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration 
package for the appointment of an Executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package will take into account the elements and constraints of 
those of the existing Directors performing similar roles and the individual circumstances of the new Director. This means a potential maximum bonus 
opportunity of 200% of base salary and long-term incentive maximum face value of opportunity at award of 500% of base salary.
When considering the remuneration arrangements of individuals recruited from external roles to the Board, we will take into account the remuneration 
package of that individual in their prior role. We only provide additional compensation to individuals for awards forgone. If necessary we will seek to 
replicate, as far as practicable, the level and timing of such remuneration, taking into account also any remaining performance requirements applying to 
it. This will be achieved by granting awards of cash or shares that vest over a timeframe similar to those forfeited and, if appropriate, based on performance 
conditions. A commensurate reduction in quantum will be applied where it is determined that the new awards are either not subject to performance 
conditions or subject to performance conditions that are not as stretching as those of the awards forfeited. Where it is not practicable to grant these 
‘buy-out’ awards using the GLTI rules submitted to shareholders at the 2023 AGM, the Company may grant these awards using bespoke arrangements.
Service contracts of Executive Directors
Executive Directors’ contracts have rolling terms and can be terminated with no more than 12 months’ notice.
The key elements of the service contract for Executive Directors relate to remuneration, payments on loss of office (see next page), and restrictions 
during active employment (and for 12 months thereafter). These restrictions include non-competition and non-solicitation of customers and employees.

Treatment of corporate events
All of the Company’s share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control of the Company. Outstanding awards and options would 
normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control taking into account, in respect of GLTI awards, the extent to which, in the 
Remuneration Committee’s opinion, any relevant performance conditions are satisfied, the Company’s and the Executive Director’s performance, 
any other relevant factors and, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed.
In the event of a demerger, distribution (other than an ordinary dividend) or other transaction which would affect the current or future value of 
any award, the Remuneration Committee may allow awards to vest on the same basis as for a change of control described above. Alternatively, 
an adjustment may be made to the number of shares if considered appropriate.
Payments for departing Executive Directors
In the table below we summarise the key elements of our Remuneration Policy on payments for loss of office. We will always comply both with the relevant 
plan rules and local employment legislation. The Remuneration Committee may make any statutory payment that is required in any relevant jurisdiction.
Provision 
Policy
Notice period and 
compensation for 
loss of office in 
service contracts
 – 12 months’ notice from the Company to the Executive Director.
 – Up to 12 months’ base salary and contractual benefits (in line with the notice period). Notice period payments will either 
be made as normal (if the Executive Director continues to work during the notice period or is on gardening leave) or they 
will be made as monthly payments in lieu of notice (subject to mitigation if alternative employment is obtained).
Treatment of 
annual bonus 
(‘GSTIP’) on 
termination  
under plan rules
 – The annual bonus may be pro-rated for the period of service during the financial year and will reflect the extent to which 
Company performance has been achieved. The annual bonus may be paid in such proportions of cash and shares, and 
subject to such deferral arrangements, as the Remuneration Committee may determine.
 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust the entitlement to an annual bonus to reflect the individual’s 
performance and the circumstances of the termination.
Treatment of 
unvested 
long-term 
incentive awards 
(‘GLTI’) on 
termination  
under plan rules
 – Normally, unvested GLTI awards will lapse when an Executive Director leaves the Group. However, an Executive Director’s 
award will vest in accordance with the terms of the plan to the extent determined by the Remuneration Committee 
taking into account applicable performance conditions, the underlying performance of the Company and of the 
Executive Director and any other relevant factors, if the Executive Director dies in service or leaves because of their ill 
health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, or the sale of their employing company or business out of the Group 
or for any other reason determined by the Remuneration Committee, more than five months after the month in which 
the award is granted. The Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine whether the award will vest at the 
normal vesting date or earlier. The Remuneration Committee will determine the satisfaction of performance conditions 
applicable to the award. Awards will, unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, be pro-rated for the 
proportion of the vesting period that had elapsed at the date the Executive Director leaves the Group.
 – The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary the level of vesting as deemed appropriate, and in particular to 
determine that awards should not vest for reasons which may include, at their absolute discretion, departure in case 
of poor performance, departure without the agreement of the Board, or detrimental competitive activity.
Pension and 
benefits
 – Generally pension and benefit provisions will continue to apply until the termination date.
 – Where appropriate other benefits may be receivable, such as (but not limited to) payments in lieu of accrued holiday, 
legal fees, tax advice costs in relation to the termination and outplacement support.
 – Benefits of relatively small value may continue after termination where appropriate, such as (but not limited to) mobile phone provision.
In exceptional circumstances, an arrangement may be established specifically to facilitate the exit of a particular individual albeit that any such 
arrangement would be made within the context of minimising the cost to the Group. We will only take such a course of action in exceptional 
circumstances and where it is considered to be in the best interests of shareholders.
Chair and Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
Our policy is for the Chair to review the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors annually following consultation with the Remuneration 
Committee Chair. Fees for the Chair are set by the Remuneration Committee.
Element
Policy
Fees
 – We aim to pay competitively for the role including consideration of the time commitment required. We benchmark the fees 
against an appropriate external comparator group. We pay a fee to our Chair which includes fees for chair of any committees. 
We pay a fee to each of our other Non-Executive Directors and they may receive an additional fee if they chair or are a member 
of a committee and/or hold the position of Senior Independent Director (although the Remuneration Committee does not 
currently intend to award additional fees for serving on a Board committee, other than for chairing that committee). Non-
Executive Directors’ fee levels are set within the maximum level as approved by shareholders as part of our Articles of 
Association. We review the structure of fees from time to time and may, as appropriate, make changes to the manner in which 
total fees are structured, including but not limited to any additional chair or membership fees.
Allowances
 – Under a legacy arrangement, an allowance is payable each time certain non-Europe-based Non-Executive Directors are 
required to travel to attend Board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved. 
Incentives
 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans. 
Benefits
 – Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any benefit plans. The Company does not provide any contribution to their 
pension arrangements. The Chair is entitled to the use of a car and a driver whenever and wherever they are providing their services to 
or representing the Company. We have been advised that for Non-Executive Directors, certain travel and accommodation expenses 
in relation to attending Board meetings should be treated as a taxable benefit, therefore we also cover the tax liability for these expenses. 
Non-Executive Director letters of appointment
Non-Executive Directors are engaged on letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities. The appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors may be terminated without compensation. Non-Executive Directors are generally not expected to serve for a period exceeding nine 
years. For further information refer to the Nominations and Governance Committee section of the Annual Report.

Annual Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
In this section we give details of the composition of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) and activities undertaken during the 2024 
financial year. The Committee’s function is to exercise independent judgement and consists only of the following independent Non-Executive 
Directors:
Chair: Amparo Moraleda (appointed 25 July 2023), Valerie Gooding (until 25 July 2023) 
Committee members: Delphine Ernotte Cunci, Michel Demaré and Dame Clara Furse (until 25 July 2023)
The Committee regularly consults with Margherita Della Valle, Group Chief Executive, and Leanne Wood, the Chief Human Resources Officer, on 
various matters relating to the appropriateness of awards for Executive Directors and senior executives, though they are not present when their 
own compensation is discussed. In addition, James Ludlow, the Group Reward and Policy Director, provides a perspective on information provided 
to the Committee, and requests information and analysis from external advisers as required. Maaike de Bie, the Group General Counsel and 
Company Secretary, advises the Committee on corporate governance guidelines and is Secretary to the Committee.
External advisers
The Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. The appointed advisers, WTW, were 
appointed by the Committee in 2007. The Chair of the Committee has direct access to these advisers as and when required, and the Committee 
determines the protocols by which these advisers interact with management in support of the Committee. The advice and recommendations of 
the external advisers are used as a guide, but do not serve as a substitute for thorough consideration of the issues by each Committee member. 
Advisers attend Committee meetings occasionally, as and when required by the Committee.
WTW is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code 
of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. This is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, 
competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants. WTW has confirmed that it adhered to that Code of Conduct 
throughout the year for all remuneration services provided to Vodafone and therefore the Committee is satisfied that it is independent and 
objective. The Remuneration Consultants’ Group Code of Conduct is available at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.

2024 remuneration
In this section we summarise the pay packages awarded to our Executive Directors for performance in the 2024 financial year versus 2023. 
Specifically, we have provided a table that shows all remuneration that was earned by each individual during the year and computed a single total 
remuneration figure for the year. The value of the annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) reflects what was earned in respect of the year but will be paid out in the 
following year. Similarly the value of the long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) reflects the share award which will vest in August 2024 as a result of the 
performance through the three-year period ended 31 March 2024.
Consideration of the use of discretion
The Remuneration Committee reviews all incentive awards prior to payment and uses judgement to ensure that the final assessments of 
performance are fair and appropriate. If circumstances warrant it, the Committee may adjust the final payment or vesting.
The Committee reviewed incentive outcomes at the May 2024 meeting and considered the appropriateness of outcomes in light of wider 
financial and business performance and the wider employee experience across the relevant measurement periods for both the short-term and 
long-term incentive plans. The Committee agreed the outcomes were appropriate and that no adjustments were required to either the short-term 
or long-term incentive outcomes this year.
Board changes
Margherita Della Valle was appointed Group Chief Executive on 27 April 2023, having previously held the role on an interim basis effective 1 
January 2023. Prior to this Margherita had held the role of Chief Financial Officer. Margherita’s 2024 single figure therefore predominantly reflects 
remuneration received in respect of her time as Group Chief Executive whereas her 2023 single figure includes remuneration arrangements in 
relation to her time as Chief Financial Officer.
Luka Mucic was appointed Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 September 2023 and this period of service is reflected in his 2024 single figure.

Notes:
1. Taxable benefits include amounts in respect of:  
– Private healthcare (2024: Margherita Della Valle £2,801; 2023: Margherita Della Valle £2,575);  
– Cash car allowance £19,200 p.a.;  
– Travel (2024: Margherita Della Valle £17,590, Luka Mucic £1,663; 2023: Margherita Della Valle £4,235); and  
– Relocation (2024: Luka Mucic £102,215).
2. The share prices used for the 2023 and 2024 values, as set out in note 3 below, are lower than the grant prices for the respective awards. As such, no amount of the value shown in the 2023 or 2024 
column is attributable to share price appreciation during the performance or vesting periods.
3. The value shown in the 2023 column is the award which vested on 3 August 2023 and is valued using the execution share price on 3 August 2023 of 72.84 pence. The value shown in the 2024 
column is the award which vests on 3 August 2024 and is valued using an average closing share price over the last quarter of the 2024 financial year of 67.84 pence.
4. Under the GLTI, executives receive a cash award equivalent in value to the dividends that would have been paid during the vesting period on any shares that vest. The dividend value shown in 2024 
relates to awards vesting on 3 August 2024.
2024 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) payout (audited)
In the table below we disclose our achievement against each of the performance measures and targets in our annual bonus (‘GSTIP’) and the 
resulting total annual bonus payout level for the year ended 31 March 2024 of 71.2% of maximum. This is applied to the maximum bonus level of 
200% of base salary for each Executive Director. Commentary on our performance against each measure is provided on the next page.

Financial metrics
As set out in the table above, EBIT finished above the mid-point of the respective target ranges whilst service revenue and free cash flow finished 
between the mid and maximum point of the respective target ranges.
Customers metrics
An assessment of performance under the customers measures was conducted on a market-by-market basis. Each market was assessed against a 
number of different metrics against the following measures:
 – Net Promoter Score (‘NPS’) for both Consumer and Vodafone Business – defined as the extent to which our customers would recommend us.
 – Churn – defined as total gross customer disconnections in the period divided by the average total customers in the period.
 – Revenue market share (‘RMS’) – based on our total service revenue and that of our competitors in the markets we operate in.
All measures utilise data from our local markets which is collected and validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies 
where possible. Further details on our performance against each key metric is set out below.
During the year we recorded strong Consumer NPS market leadership or co-leadership positions in UK, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Albania in 
Europe, and South Africa, Egypt, Tanzania, Lesotho and DRC in Africa. Our benchmark Consumer NPS monitoring was supported with additional 
insight gained from launching lifecycle NPS monitoring across a number of our markets. This methodology assessed our progress against our 
strategic focus of reducing the number of deep detractors by asking whether customers would recommend Vodafone to friends, family or 
colleagues. All but one of our markets saw a reduction in deep detractors with notable progress made in Portugal, Turkey and the UK. Overall, we 
reduced deep detractors by 14% in Europe and 16% at a Group level - a reduction of over four million unhappy customers from the start of the 
year. In respect of Business NPS, we ended the performance period holding the lead position in five markets and made significant improvements 
in our gap to market leaders in Germany and Turkey. 
We have recorded broadly stable overall churn levels in our European markets. In respect of mobile, we have maintained low churn levels in 
Vodacom Group and in a number of our European markets. In both Germany and the UK we have seen year-on-year improvements and in the UK 
this has been principally driven by customer experience initiatives. In respect of our fixed services, we have recorded steady year-on-year results in 
Europe and improvements in Turkey and our African markets despite economic and geopolitical challenges. 
We have reported steady results in our overall RMS position this year with good performance reported in a majority of our markets, supported by 
an updated pricing strategy. We have seen year-on-year improvements in our fixed line services in markets including, but not limited to, the UK, 
Egypt, Greece and Czech Republic. Elsewhere in our mobile services, we have reported improvements in South Africa, Egypt, Portugal and 
Romania.
It is within this context that performance against our customers measures during the year was judged to be above the mid point of the respective 
ranges for NPS and churn and at the mid point of the target range for RMS.

Specified procedures are performed by our internal audit team over the adjusted free cash flow to assist with the Committee’s assessment of 
performance. The performance assessment in respect of the TSR measure is undertaken by WTW. ESG performance is presented to the ESG 
Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee prior to the achievement level being reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. Details of how the 
plan works can be found in the Remuneration Policy.
Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awarded during the year (audited)
The independent performance conditions for the 2024 long-term incentive awards made in July 2023, and subject to a three-year performance 
period ending 31 March 2026, are adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award) and ESG (10% of total award) 
performance as follows:

The adjusted free cash flow for the three-year period ended on 31 
March 2024 was €16.1 billion and equates to vesting under the FCF 
element of 65.3% of maximum.
The chart to the right shows that our TSR performance over the 
three-year period ended on 31 March 2024 was below the median of 
the peer group resulting in no vesting under this measure.
ESG performance across our three metrics was as follows:
 – GHG reduction: exceeded GHG reduction of 60% from the FY17 
baseline as at 31 March 2024.
 – Women in management: exceeded 35% representation of women 
in management at 31 March 2024.
 – M-Pesa: slightly below ambition of 68.2m connections at 31 March 
2024. 
The Committee reviewed the above performance and determined 
vesting under the ESG element of 96.9% of maximum. This reflected 
full achievement under the GHG reduction and the Women in 
management metrics where ambitions were exceeded, and partial 
vesting under the M-Pesa metric where strong progress against the 
stretching ambition was made.

The structure for awards made in July 2022 (vesting July 2025) and July 2023 (vesting July 2026) is set out on the previous page. Further details 
of the structure of these awards, and relevant targets, can be found in the Annual Report on Remuneration of the relevant year.
All-employee share plans
During the year the Executive Directors were eligible to participate in the Vodafone Group Sharesave Plan which is a HM Revenue & Customs 
(‘HMRC’) approved scheme. Options under the plan are granted at up to a 20% discount to market value. No Executive Directors currently hold 
options under the plan.
Pensions (audited)
During the 2024 financial year, Margherita Della Valle accrued benefits under the defined contribution pension plan of £10,000, with the 
remainder of her 10% of base salary pension benefit for the year delivered as a cash allowance. Luka Mucic received a pro-rated cash allowance of 
10% of base salary.
Margherita Della Valle has not participated in a Vodafone sponsored defined benefit scheme during her employment. The Executive Directors are 
provided benefits in the event of death in service. In the event of ill health, an entitlement to benefit of two-thirds of base salary, up to a maximum 
benefit determined by the insurer, may be provided up until state pension age. In respect of the Executive Committee members, during the year 
the Group has made aggregate contributions of £171,177 (2023: £147,507) into defined contribution pension schemes during the year.
Alignment to shareholder interests (audited) 
Share ownership levels and requirements for individuals who held the position of Executive Director are set out in the table below. 
As shown in the chart below, both executives increased their shareholding level during the year. The share price used for measurement purposes 
decreased from 93.85 pence for the 31 March 2023 measurement to 67.84 pence for the 31 March 2024 measurement.

The shareholding requirements include a post-employment condition whereby the Executive Directors will need to continue to hold shares 
equivalent to the value of their requirement at the date of departure (or actual holding on departure if the requirement has not been reached 
during employment) for a further two years post-employment. The Committee has a number of processes in place to ensure this condition is met, 
including executives agreeing to these terms prior to receiving an award, executives holding the majority of their shares (and at least up to the 
value of their requirement) in a Company-accessible account, and the Committee having the ability to lapse any unvested GLTI awards if the 
condition is not met.
Collectively the Executive Committee, including the Executive Directors, owned 28,937,317 Vodafone shares at 31 March 2024, with a value of 
over £19.6 million. None of the Executive Committee members’ shareholdings amounts to more than 1% of the issued shares in that class of 
share, excluding treasury shares.
Directors’ interests in the shares of the Company (audited)
A summary of interests in shares and scheme interests of the Directors who served during the year is given below. More details of the outstanding

Pay in the wider context
Remuneration arrangements
As part of its review of executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes account of the pay policies in place across the wider business. 
This includes considering the structure of remuneration offerings at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how 
packages evolve across the different levels of the organisation.
During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration structure across the business, which included how our arrangements aligned with our 
strategy, supported our purpose, and celebrated the Spirit of Vodafone. The update also set out the results of the latest annual fair pay review, 
including where the key focus areas were and what actions had been agreed locally to implement any required adjustments. 
Details of our remuneration offerings at each level of the business are provided on the following page.

Senior Leadership Team
Wider workforce
Base salary
An annual benchmarking review is run across all levels of the organisation. At each level the review ensures appropriate job matches and 
comparator groups are used, with external market data used to help inform line manager decisions on salary increases. 
Our annual fair pay review (see below for further details) provides a robust process for ensuring new pay range 
positionings are fair across our organisation.
Pension
Pension provision across all levels is driven by local market practice. As per our fair pay principles (see below), our global 
standard ensures all of our people have access to appropriate state- or company-provided pension provision.
Benefits
Benefit provision across all levels is driven by local market practice. As per our fair pay principles, our global standard is to 
offer all our people life insurance, parental leave and access to either state- or company-provided healthcare provision.

Recognising performance and potential
To ensure we recognise and differentiate the reward of our employees, the total value of an employee’s short-term and, if relevant, long-term 
incentive is driven by their impact and talent rating. To be eligible for a short-term incentive award, employees must meet minimum performance 
standards, which include completion of our mandatory compliance training. 
Fair pay at Vodafone
In addition to being a core principle of the Committee, there is a clear culture in our business of ensuring we offer competitive and fair pay to all 
our people. Our approach across our business is guided by the six principles set out below. Our commitment to these principles is reflected in how 
the UK-based Living Wage Foundation has certified us as an Accredited Living Wage employer.
1. Market competitive
2. Free from 
discrimination
3. Ensure a good 
standard of living
The pay of our people is reflective of their skills, 
role and function and the external market.
We annually review the pay of each person and 
actively manage any who fall below the market 
competitive range.
Our pay should not be affected by gender, age, 
disability, gender identity and expression, sexual 
orientation, race, ethnicity, cultural heritage or belief.
We annually compare the average position of our 
men and women against their market benchmark, 
grade and function to identify and understand any 
differences and take action if necessary.
We work with an independent organisation, 
WageIndicator Foundation, to assess how our pay 
compares to the ‘living wage’ in each of our 
markets because we are committed to providing a 
good standard of living for our people and their 
families.
4. Share in our successes
5. Provide benefits for all
6. Open and transparent
All our people should have the opportunity to 
share in our success by being eligible to receive 
some form of performance-related pay, e.g. a 
bonus, shares or sales incentive.
Our global standard is to offer all our people life 
insurance, parental leave and access to either 
Company or state provided healthcare and pension 
provision.
We ensure that our people understand their pay. 
We do this through a series of user-friendly guides, 
webpages and an annual reward statement, which 
help explain our people’s pay and outline the 
value of their core reward package.
Cost of living actions
Rising inflation levels and the subsequent cost of living crisis continue to affect a number of employees in our markets. As a result, we continue to 
provide targeted measures which include the delivery of additional or accelerated salary reviews and the provision of extra cash allowances 
outside the annual reward review cycle.
Given the rapid inflationary change affecting those in Egypt, a supplementary Cost of Living Allowance (‘COLA’) was introduced, prior to two 
off-cycle increases implemented during the year. In Turkey, where they are experiencing hyper-inflation, we took a similar approach by 
accelerating our salary reviews and providing two additional off-cycle increases.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)
In our European markets, we delivered a one-off payment to non-tariff Germany employees below senior leadership level and in Ireland we 
delivered a salary increase to front-line employees. For all our markets we carefully consider wider market conditions when setting salary budgets 
for the 2024 annual reward review.
Risk management
The Committee undertakes an annual review of the potential risks within our incentive plans and what steps have been taken to mitigate these. 
The review looks at both the structure of our incentives and the performance conditions used. Given our current structure and performance 
metrics, the 2024 review focused on risk areas such as capital expenditure and alignment between management and stakeholders. 
Stakeholder engagement
The Committee considers all stakeholder groups when setting executive pay including:
Employees 
The Committee is fully briefed on pay arrangements across the business to ensure any decisions on executive pay are made 
within our wider business context and take into account wider employee pay conditions. We engage with our employees 
through a variety of means including employee forums, interactive webinars (including with our executives), global Spirit 
Beat surveys and digital platforms, all of which give our people the chance to voice their opinion on any area of interest, 
including all-employee and executive pay.
Customers
The importance of customers to our strategy is reflected in how our annual bonus plan includes the customer-focused 
measures of Revenue Market Share, NPS, and Churn. 
Shareholders
The Committee values the active participation of our shareholders during our consultations and fully considers all feedback 
as part of the review process.
Government
The Committee actively engages with external professional bodies and government departments when they issue 
consultations on proposed changes to legislation or reporting guidelines.
Wider society
The Committee is fully aware that society remains concerned about the risk of excessive executive pay practices in the 
wider market. The Committee believes that transparent reporting and active engagement in explaining both the operation 
of, and rationale for, executive pay decisions is key for businesses to retain trust in this area.
UK gender pay gap reporting
Each year we publish our UK gender pay gap in line with the statutory UK methodology. The nature of the statutory calculation means the gap 
will fluctuate year on year, influenced by changes in our business structure, Company performance and the percentage of men and women at all 
levels and positions. The existence of a UK gender pay gap in our business is primarily a consequence of more men than women holding senior or 
specialist, and therefore higher-paid, roles.
With our commitment to embed an inclusive culture, we continue our work to reduce the gap and have made good progress since the publication 
of our first report in 2017. Our global programmes aim to support women across different roles, areas, and geographies of our business and will, 
over time, reduce our specific UK gender pay gap, which this year was calculated as 9.0% – a slight decrease from our 2022 figure of 10.4%.
We are proud of the policies that we have put in place to support our employees and we remain committed to addressing female representation at 
senior levels and the gender pay gap.

The calculation methodology used reflects Option B as defined under the relevant regulations. In line with the relevant regulations this utilises the 
most recently collected and disclosed data analysed within our Gender Pay Gap report, with employees at the three quartiles identified from this 
analysis and their respective single figure values calculated.
To ensure this data accurately reflects individuals at such quartiles, the single figure values for individuals immediately above and below the 
identified employee at each quartile within the gender pay gap analysis were also reviewed.
In recent years our ratios have remained relatively consistent, reflecting how the single figures for both the Chief Executive and employees at the 
quartile positions have remained stable when viewed over the period set out in the table above. In general we expect the ratios to be primarily 
driven by the valuation of the long-term incentive that is included in the Chief Executive’s single figure for the year.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)
Change in remuneration for Directors and all employees
In line with regulatory requirements, the table below calculates the percentage change in Directors’ remuneration (salary, taxable benefits and 
annual bonus payment) compared to the average remuneration for other Vodafone Group employees who are measured on comparable business 
objectives and who have been employed in the UK since 2020 (2020 to 2021), 2021 (2021 to 2022), 2022 (2022 to 2023), and 2023 (2023 to 
2024) (per capita). Vodafone has employees based all around the world and some of these individuals work in countries with very high salary 
inflation; therefore Vodafone’s UK-based Group employees are deemed the most appropriate employee group for this comparison.

Notes:
1. Luka Mucic was appointed as Group Chief Financial Officer on 1 September 2023.
2. Valerie Gooding, Sir Crispin Davis, and Dame Clara Furse stepped down on 25 July 2023.
3. Hatem Dowidar was appointed on 19 February 2024.
As set out in last year’s report, the year-on-year increase in Margherita Della Valle’s pay between 2022 and 2023 reflects Margherita’s change in 
role during the period. The percentage increase in the table above does not reflect the actual increase during the year under review in respect of 
the salary payable for the role of Chief Executive which was increased by 3% effective 1 July 2022. Further details can be found in the 2023 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
The significant year-on-year increase in fees and taxable benefits for Christine Ramon between 2023 and 2024, Deborah Kerr between 2022 and 
2023, and Jean-François van Boxmeer between 2021 and 2022 reflect how the values in the previous year were not based on a full 12 months of 
service due to their respective appointments at various points in the year. Therefore the year-on-year increase does not indicate an actual 
increase in the fees payable to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors during those periods. 
Whilst some of the percentages within the ‘Taxable benefits’ column look significant, these actually reflect relatively small increases in value when 
viewed on an absolute basis. The significant change in taxable benefits for the period between 2021 and 2022 reflect how certain travel and 
accommodation expenses in relation to attending Board meetings were lower than normal in 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 on the ability 
to attend meetings in-person.
Assessing pay and performance
In the table on the next page we summarise the Chief Executive’s single figure remuneration over the past 10 years and how our variable pay 
plans have paid out in relation to the maximum opportunity. This can be compared with the historic TSR performance over the same period. The 
chart below shows the performance of the Company relative to the STOXX Europe 600 Index over a 10-year period. The STOXX Europe 600 Index 
was selected as this is a broad-based index that includes markets in which we operate. It should be noted that the TSR element of the 2022 GLTI is 
based on the TSR performance shown in the chart on page 109 and not this chart.

2025 remuneration
Details of how key elements of the Remuneration Policy will be implemented for the 2025 financial year are set out below.
2025 base salaries
As part of this year’s review, conducted in March 2024, the Committee reviewed executive remuneration arrangements against its comparator 
group of FTSE 30 companies (excluding financial services). 
Following the review the Committee concluded that the salaries of the Executive Directors would remain unchanged. This was felt to be 
appropriate considering Margherita Della Valle’s salary increase following her permanent appointment as Group Chief Executive in April 2023, and 
given Luka Mucic’s salary was set appropriately when he joined as Chief Financial Officer in September 2023. As a result, the salaries for the 
Executive Directors are as follows:
 – Group Chief Executive (Margherita Della Valle): £1,250,000 
 – Group Chief Financial Officer (Luka Mucic): £760,000
2025 annual bonus (‘GSTIP’)
Following its annual review of the GSTIP structure, the Committee agreed that the performance measures and associated weightings continue to 
support the strategic priorities of Growth and Customers and therefore the 2025 plan should remain unchanged from 2024 as follows: 
Growth (70% of total)
Service revenue (20%); adjusted EBIT (20%); adjusted free cash flow (20%); and revenue market share (10%).
Customers (30% of total)
Net Promoter Score1 (20%); and churn (10%).
Note:
1. The assessment of NPS utilises data collected in our local markets which is validated for quality and consistency by independent third-party agencies.
Due to the potential impact on our commercial interests, annual bonus targets are considered commercially sensitive and therefore will be 
disclosed in the 2025 Remuneration Report following the completion of the financial year.
Long-term incentive (‘GLTI’) awards for 2025
Awards for 2025 will be made in line with the arrangements described in our policy on pages 102 and 103. Vesting of the 2025 award will be 
subject to adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award), relative TSR (30% of total award), and ESG (10% of total award) performance. Performance 
will be measured over the three financial years ending 31 March 2027, and any net vested shares will be subject to an additional two-year holding 
period. It is anticipated that the final awards will be reviewed by the Committee at the July 2024 meeting and, subject to the Committee’s 
approval, will be granted shortly afterwards.
Further details of the 2025 award targets are provided below and on the next page.
Adjusted free cash flow (60% of total award)
Details of the final three-year adjusted free cash flow target range will be disclosed in the relevant market announcement at the time of grant and 
published in the 2025 Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Annual Report on Remuneration (continued)
Relative TSR (30% of total award)
Following the annual review of the performance measures, which included a review of analysis provided by the Committee’s external advisers, 
the Committee determined that the TSR outperformance range for the 2025 award should be set at 7.0% p.a. at maximum. The Committee 
reviewed the TSR peer group and noted the removal of Telefónica Deutschland based on its recent unlisted status, and agreed to remove Royal KPN based 
on its relevance to the Company. Further details on the TSR outperformance range and peer group for the 2025 award are set out in the tables below.

Linear interpolation (i.e. straight-line vesting) occurs for performance between threshold and maximum.

The table below sets out how performance under the ESG measure for the 2025 award will be assessed against two quantitative ambitions:
Purpose focus area1

management by 31 March 2027
Notes:
1. This year our Company Purpose has been refreshed and applicable focus areas outlined above have been renamed to Protecting the Planet and Empowering People. Read more on page 80.
2. This near-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (‘SBTi’).
Each ambition for the 2025 award has been set by considering both our externally communicated targets and our internal progress as at 31 March 2024. 
The Committee agreed to remove the financial inclusion metric included in previous awards based on its sole focus on Vodacom Group which 
limits its global reach compared to other metrics outlined above. 
At the end of the performance period the Committee will assess achievement across the two metrics against the stated ambitions and determine vesting 
under this element. Full disclosure of the rationale for the final vesting decision will be provided in the relevant Directors’ Remuneration Report.
2025 remuneration for the Chair and Non-Executive Directors
Fees for our Chair and Non-Executive Directors have been benchmarked against the FTSE 30 (excluding financial services companies). Following 
this year’s review it was agreed that the current additional fee levels for the Senior Independent Director and/or Committee Chairs would be 
increased. While it was agreed there would be no changes to the Chair and Non-Executive Director base fee at this time, fees will be assessed in 
next year’s review. Details of the 2025 fee levels are set out in the table below.

Further remuneration information
Dilution
All awards are made under plans that incorporate dilution limits as set out in the guidelines for share incentive schemes published by the Investment Association. 
The current estimated dilution from subsisting executive awards is approximately 2.8% of the Company’s share capital at 31 March 2024 (2.4% at 31 March 
2023), whilst from all-employee share awards it is approximately 0.3% (0.3% at 31 March 2023). This gives a total dilution of 3.1% (2.7% at 31 March 2023).
Service contracts
The terms and conditions of appointment of our Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business 
hours and at the Annual General Meeting (for 15 minutes prior to the meeting and during the meeting). The Executive Directors have notice 
periods in their service contracts of 12 months. The Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or 
for compensation if their appointments are terminated.

Our US listing requirements
Board member independence
Different tests of independence for Board members are applied under the 2024 UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘Code’) and the NASDAQ listing rules (the ‘NASDAQ Listing Rules’). The 
Board is not required to take into consideration NASDAQ’s detailed definitions of independence 
as set out in the NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Board has carried out an assessment based on the 
independence requirements of the Code and has determined that, in its judgement, each of 
Vodafone’s Non-Executive Directors is independent within the meaning of those requirements. 
Committees
The NASDAQ Listing Rules require US companies to have a nominations committee, an audit 
committee and a compensation committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, 
with the nominations committee and the audit committee each required to have a written charter 
that addresses the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, and the compensation committee 
having sole authority and adequate funding to engage compensation consultants, independent 
legal counsel and other compensation advisers. 
 – Our Nominations and Governance Committee is chaired by the Chair of the Board and its other 
members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
 – Our Remuneration Committee is composed entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors.
 – Our Audit and Risk Committee is composed entirely of Non-Executive Directors, each of whom 
(i) the Board has determined to be independent based on the independence requirements of 
the Code; and (ii) meets the independence requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934.
 – We have terms of reference for our Nominations and Governance Committee, Audit and Risk 
Committee and Remuneration Committee, all of which comply with the requirements of the 
Code and are available for inspection on our website at vodafone.com/governance.
 – These terms of reference are generally responsive to the relevant NASDAQ Listing Rules, but 
may not address all aspects of these rules.
Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct
Under the NASDAQ Listing Rules, US companies must adopt a Code of Conduct applicable to all 
directors, officers and employees that complies with the definition of a ‘Code of Ethics’ set out in 
section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
 – We have adopted a Code of Ethics that complies with section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
that is applicable only to the senior financial and principal executive officers.
Click to read our Code of Ethics: 
vodafone.com/governance
 – We have also adopted a separate Code of Conduct which applies to all employees.
Quorum
The quorum required for shareholder meetings, in accordance with our Articles of Association, is 
two shareholders, regardless of the level of their aggregate share ownership, while US companies 
listed on NASDAQ are required by the NASDAQ Listing Rules to have a minimum quorum of 
33.33% of the holders of ordinary shares for shareholder meetings. 
Related-party transactions
In lieu of obtaining an independent review of related-party transactions for conflicts of interests 
in accordance with the NASDAQ Listing Rules, we seek shareholder approval for related-party 
transactions that (i) meet certain financial thresholds, or (ii) have unusual features in accordance 
with the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK (the ‘FCA Listing 
Rules’), the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association. 
Further, we use the definition of a transaction with a related party as set out in the FCA Listing 
Rules, which differs in certain respects from the definition of related party transaction in the 
NASDAQ Listing Rules. 
Shareholder approval
When determining whether shareholder approval is required for a proposed transaction, we 
comply with both the NASDAQ Listing Rules and the FCA Listing Rules. Under the NASDAQ 
Listing Rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends on, among 
other things, the percentage of shares to be issued or sold in connection with the transaction. 
Under the FCA Listing Rules, whether shareholder approval is required for a transaction depends 
on, among other things, whether the size of a transaction exceeds a certain percentage of the 
size of the listed company undertaking the transaction. 
As Vodafone’s American Depositary Shares are listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (‘NASDAQ’), we are 
required to disclose a summary of any material differences between the corporate governance practices we follow and those of US companies 
listed on NASDAQ. Vodafone’s corporate governance practices are primarily based on UK requirements but substantially conform to those 
required of US companies listed on NASDAQ.
The material differences are set out in the following table:

Directors’ statement of responsibility
The Directors are responsible for preparing the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations and for keeping proper 
accounting records. Detailed below are statements 
made by the Directors in relation to their 
responsibilities, disclosure of information to the 
Company’s auditor, going concern and 
management’s report on internal control over 
financial reporting.
Financial statements and accounting records
Company law of England and Wales requires the Directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group at the 
end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 – Select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
 – Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 – Present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 – State whether the consolidated financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting 
Standards (‘IAS’), with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(‘IASB’) and with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 
2006 (the ‘Act’);
 – State for the Company’s financial statements whether applicable 
UK accounting standards have been followed; and
 – Prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis unless it 
is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued by the IASB and with the 
requirements of the Act. They are also responsible for the system 
of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and 
the Group, and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 
76 to 78, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
 – The consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued by the IASB and with the 
requirements of the Act, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group;
 – The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance 
with UK generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Company; and
 – The Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description and robust assessment of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The Directors are also responsible under section 172 of the 
Companies Act 2006 for promoting the success of the Company for 
the benefit of its members as a whole and in doing so have regard for 
the needs of wider society and stakeholders, including customers, 
consistent with the Group’s core and sustainable business objectives.
Having taken advice from the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board 
considers the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and that it provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Neither the Company nor the Directors accepts any liability to any 
person in relation to the Annual Report except to the extent that such 
liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a 
person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading 
statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with 
section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets 
Act 2000.
Disclosure of information to the auditors
Having made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors are aware, 
there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of 
the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditor is unaware 
and the Directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, performance, position, principal risks 
and uncertainties and the Directors’ assessment of its long-term 
viability are set out on page 63. 
In addition, the funding position of the Group is included in 
‘Borrowings’ and ‘Capital and financial risk management’ in notes 21 
and 22, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. Notes 
21 and 22 include disclosure in relation to the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing, as well as details regarding its 
capital, its financial risk management objectives, its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk. As noted on pages 193 to 194, the Group has access to 
substantial cash and financing facilities. 
The Group also believes it adequately manages or mitigates its 
solvency and liquidity risks through two primary processes, described 
below
Business planning process and performance management 
The Group’s forecasting and planning cycle consists of in-year 
forecasts, a budget and a long-range plan. These generate income 
statement, cash flow and net debt projections for assessment by 
Group management and the Board. Each forecast is compared with 
prior forecasts and actual results to identify variances and understand 
the drivers of the changes and their future impact so management 
can take action where appropriate. Additional analysis is undertaken 
to review and sense check the key assumptions underpinning the 
forecasts. These forecasts also review the expected outcomes of 
announced M&A transactions. 
Cash flow and liquidity reviews 
The business planning process provides outputs for detailed cash flow 
and liquidity reviews, to ensure that the Group maintains adequate 
liquidity throughout the forecast periods. The prime output is a 
liquidity forecast that is prepared and updated at least on a monthly 
basis, which highlights the extent of the Group’s liquidity based on 
controlled cash flows and the headroom under the Group’s undrawn 
revolving credit facility. The key inputs into this forecast are: 
 – Free cash flow forecasts with information taken from the business 
planning process; 
 – Bond and other debt maturities; 
 – Completion of committed M&A transactions; and 
 – Expectations for shareholder returns and spectrum auctions. 
The liquidity forecast is reviewed by the Group Chief Financial Officer 
and included in each of the reports to the Board. In addition, the 
Group continues to manage its foreign exchange and interest rate 
risks within the framework of policies and guidelines authorised and 
reviewed by the Board, with oversight provided by the Treasury Risk 
Committee. 
The Directors have also considered sensitivities in respect of potential 
downside scenarios in concluding that the Group is able to continue 
in operation for the period to 30 June 2025 from the date of 
approving the consolidated financial statements. These sensitivities 
include the non-refinancing of debt maturities, the failure of M&A 
disposal transactions to complete in the assessment period mitigated 
by the cessation of share buyback plans. A reverse stress test was 
reviewed to understand how severe conditions would have to be to 
breach liquidity, including a required reduction in Adjusted EBITDAaL 
compared to current performance and forecasts. The Directors also 
considered the availability of the Group’s €7.8 billion undrawn 
revolving credit facilities as at 31 March 2024.
The Directors also considered the findings of the work performed to 
support the statement on the long-term viability of the Group. As 
noted on page 63, this included key changes to relevant principal 
risks in light of global economic and political uncertainty, sensitivity 
analysis, scenario assessments, and combinations of these, over the 
viability assessment period. 
Conclusion 
Based on the review, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
Annual Report and Accounts.
Controls over financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting for the Group.
The Group’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies 
and procedures that:
 – Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;
 – Are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with UK-adopted IAS, with IFRS as issued 
by the IASB and with the requirements of the Act, and that receipts 
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with 
authorisation of management and the Directors of the Company; and
 – Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection 
of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
During the year covered by this report, there were no changes in the 
Group’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially 
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness 
of the internal controls over financial reporting.
Any internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has 
inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the 
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures, and may 
not prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or 
because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures 
may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion:
 – Vodafone Group Plc’s consolidated financial statements and 
separate Company financial statements (the “financial statements”) 
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the 
Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of the Group’s profit for 
the year then ended;
 – the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards;
 – the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
 – the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
We have audited the financial statements of Vodafone Group Plc (the 
‘Parent company’ or ‘Company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) for 
the year ended 31 March 2024 which comprise:
Group

policy information
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements is applicable law 
and UK adopted international accounting standards. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 ‘Reduced disclosure 
framework’ (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
Basis for opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities 
under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our 
report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Independence
We are independent of the Group and Parent company in accordance 
with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the 
financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as 
applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our 
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. 
The non-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard were 
not provided to the Group or the Parent company and we remain 
independent of the Group and the Parent company in conducting the 
audit.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the 
directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the 
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation 
of the directors’ assessment of the Group and Parent company’s 
ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
included:
 – confirming our understanding of the directors’ going concern 
assessment process, including the controls over the review and 
approval of the budget and long-range plan; 
 – assessing the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern 
assessment period to 30 June 2025 (“the going concern 
assessment period”) and considering the existence of any 
significant events or conditions beyond this period based on our 
procedures on the Group’s long-range plan and knowledge arising 
from other areas of the audit;
 – verifying inputs against board-approved forecasts and debt facility 
terms and reconciling the opening liquidity position to the balance 
sheet at 31 March 2024;
 – reviewing borrowing facilities to confirm both their availability to 
the Group and the forecast debt repayments through the going 
concern assessment period and to validate that there are no 
financial covenants in relation to any of the loan arrangements;
 – testing the assessment, including forecast liquidity, for clerical 
accuracy;
 – challenging whether assumptions made were reasonable and 
appropriately severe, in light of the Group’s relevant principal risks 
and uncertainties and our own independent assessment of those 
risks; 
 – evaluating management’s historical forecasting accuracy and the 
consistency of the going concern assessment with information 
obtained from other areas of the audit, such as our audit 
procedures on the long-range plans, which underpin 
management’s goodwill impairment assessments and our 
procedures in relation to the businesses classified as held for sale 
within discontinued operations; 
 – evaluating the identified mitigating actions available to respond to 
a severe downside scenario, and whether those actions are feasible 
and within the Group’s control;
 – challenging the appropriateness of management’s ‘reverse stress 
test’ downside scenario, to understand how severe conditions 
would have to be to breach liquidity and whether the reduction in 
EBITDAaL required has no more than a remote possibility of 
occurring when compared to historical financial performance; 
 – performing independent sensitivity analysis on management’s 
assumptions, including applying incremental adverse cashflow 
sensitivities. These sensitivities included the impact of certain 
severe but plausible scenarios, evaluated as part of management’s 
work on the Group’s long term viability materialising within the 
going concern assessment period; and
 – assessing the appropriateness of the going concern disclosure on 
page 124.

Our key observations 
 – The directors’ assessment forecasts that the Group will maintain 
sufficient liquidity throughout the going concern assessment 
period. This included the scenario of non-refinancing of certain 
debt maturities in the assessment period and also the continuing 
availability of the Group’s €7.8 billion revolving credit facilities, 
undrawn as at 31 March 2024. 
 – Furthermore, management’s reverse stress test to model the 
extent of the EBITDAaL reduction compared to forecasts required 
to breach liquidity during the going concern assessment period is 
considered by management to have only a remote possibility of 
occurring when compared to historical financial performance. The 
stress test included downside sensitivities in relation to the 
completion of both the Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy 
disposals for which the estimated proceeds are included within the 
base case.
 – With the exception of the cessation of share buyback plans 
anticipated post-completion of business disposals, the controllable 
mitigating actions available to increase liquidity over the going 
concern assessment period were not modelled by management 
due to the level of headroom in the directors’ assessment forecasts.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any 
material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, 
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group 
and Parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a 
period from when the financial statements are authorised for issue to 
30 June 2025. 
In relation to the Group and Parent company’s reporting on how they 
have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors’ 
statement in the financial statements about whether the directors 
considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with 
respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this 
report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
Overview of our audit approach
Audit scope
 – We performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of 9 components, 2 of which were 
classified as ‘held for sale’ and discontinued 
operations. We also performed full audit procedures 
on specific balances for 4 components, specified 
audit procedures on specific balances for a further 6 
components and other procedures on the remaining 
300 components.
 – In respect of continuing operations, the components 
where we performed full audit procedures accounted 
for 72% of Adjusted EBITDAaL and where we 
performed full or specified audit procedures in 
respect of revenue accounted for 79% of Revenue.
Key audit 
matters
 – Carrying value of cash generating units, including 
goodwill
 – Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets 
on tax losses – Luxembourg
 – Revenue recognition
Materiality
 – Overall Group materiality of €220m (FY23: €300m) 
has been calculated based on Adjusted EBITDAaL as 
defined in the ‘Our application of materiality’ section 
of this report. This materiality represents 2% of the 
Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL as reported in Note 2 in 
the Consolidated financial statements.
An overview of the scope of the Parent company 
and Group audits 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our 
allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to 
form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and 
effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business 
environment and the potential impact of climate change and other 
factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level 
of work to be performed at each component.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the consolidated 
financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the consolidated financial 
statements, of the 319 reporting components of the Group, we 
selected 19 components covering entities within Germany, South 
Africa, Italy, United Kingdom, Spain, Turkey, Greece, Egypt, 
Luxembourg and corporate entities, which represent the principal 
business units within the Group.
Of the 19 components selected, we performed an audit of the 
complete financial information of nine components (“full scope 
components”) which were selected based on their size or risk 
characteristics. 
For four components (“specific scope components”), we performed 
full audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that 
we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 
significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the 
size of these accounts or their risk profile. For the remaining six 
components (“specified procedures components”), we performed 
certain audit procedures on specific accounts within that component 
that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the 
significant accounts in the financial statements, either because of the 
size of these accounts or their risk profile. Depending on the 
component or type of procedures, these procedures were undertaken 
by the primary audit team or a separate component audit team under 
the primary audit team’s direction. The audit scope of these 
components may not have included testing of all significant accounts 
of the component, but will have contributed to the coverage of 
significant accounts tested for the Group. 
For the remaining components where we did not perform full audit 
procedures, together these represent 28% of the Group’s Adjusted 
EBITDAaL from continuing operations, and none generate more than 
5% of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL from continuing operations. 
For these remaining components which are not full scope, specific 
scope or specified procedures scope, we performed other procedures, 
which may include analytical review at both the Group or individual 
component levels and the use of customised data analytics tools over 
the purchase to pay process, fixed assets balances and leases, to 
profile trends and identify items for further investigation, inquiry of 
management, testing entity level and group-wide controls and testing 
of journals we deemed higher risk, across these remaining

1. Two of the nine full scope components relate to Vodafone Italy and Vodafone Spain, which were classified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5 during the year. As such, they do not 
contribute to the Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL or Group revenue from continuing operations. 
2. Two further full scope components relate to the Company and another corporate entity whose activities include consolidation adjustments, which are audited by the primary audit team. Procedures 
on three of the other full scope locations are undertaken by component audit teams based in Germany and the remaining two full scope components are South Africa and the UK. 
3. The Group audit risks in relation to revenue recognition were subject to audit procedures at each of the full and specified procedures scope locations with significant revenue streams (being seven full 
scope components and three specified procedures components).
4. The primary audit team performed full audit procedures on specific accounts in respect of four finance and corporate entities across a range of significant accounts. The audit procedures did not 
include testing of all significant accounts of the components, but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts selected for testing by the primary audit team.
5. Specified procedures were performed over six entities across a range of significant accounts with three of these performed by component teams in Turkey, Egypt and Greece and the rest by the 
primary audit team. The audit procedures did not include testing of all significant accounts of the components, but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts selected for testing by 
the primary audit team.
6. The Group audit risks in relation to ‘Carrying value of cash generating units, including goodwill’ and  ‘Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses – Luxembourg’ were subject to 
audit procedures by the primary audit team on the entire balance, with support from component audit teams on certain procedures.
7. The contribution of specified procedures components to Group Adjusted EBITDAaL is included within ‘remaining components’, as audit procedures were performed on certain, but not all, significant 
accounts of the specified procedures components contributing to Group Adjusted EBITDAaL.
8. Included within the Group’s reporting components are the Group’s joint venture investments and associate investments, which are detailed in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, which 
were subject to other procedures.
9. Changes in the number of remaining components compared to prior year reflect increases in the number of entities within the Group’s consolidation system. 
 *
Adjusted EBITDAaL as defined in ‘Our application of materiality’ section of this report and is based on continuing operations only. This metric has the same definition as the Group’s Adjusted EBITDAaL 
Non-GAAP measure defined on page 236 of the Annual Report.
Changes from the prior year 
The approach to audit scoping is similar to the prior year audit, with 
the rotation of markets, designated as specified procedures scope for 
selected significant accounts, to extend the Group audit procedures 
beyond the Group’s main markets and to introduce a level of 
unpredictability through risk-based testing. This approach resulted in:
 – specified procedures scope being assigned to the component in 
Greece, which was not subject to direct audit procedures in the 
prior year; and
 – The component in Portugal being assessed as a ‘Remaining 
component’ in the current year.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we 
determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of 
the components by us, as the primary audit team, or by component 
auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our 
instruction. Of the nine full scope components, audit procedures were 
performed on two of these directly by the primary audit team with the 
remaining seven being performed by component audit teams. For the 
four specific scope components, the procedures were performed 
directly by the primary audit team. For the six specified procedures 
scope components, work was performed directly by the primary audit 
team for three of these, with the remaining three being performed by 
component audit teams. Where the work was performed by 
component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of 
involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence 
had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole.
Vodafone has centralised processes and controls over certain areas 
within its Vodafone Intelligent Solutions (“VOIS”) finance shared 
service centre locations. The primary audit team performs direct 
oversight, review, and coordination of the EY audit teams at VOIS, 
whose work includes centralised testing for certain controls and 
accounts, including procedures on leases, fixed assets, intangible 
assets, cash and centralised purchase to pay processes.
The primary audit team continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory 
Auditor visits key locations on a rotational basis. In the current year 
the Senior Statutory Auditor and other team members visited 
component teams in Germany, UK, Italy and South Africa. The Senior 
Statutory Auditor, also remotely attended audit closing meetings with 
component teams and management of all full scope locations. In 
addition, visits were undertaken by members of the primary audit 
team to the component teams in Spain, Greece, Turkey, Egypt and 
VOIS India. These visits involved meetings with local management, 
understanding the overall audit approach, including key issues and 
response as well as reviewing key work papers on risk areas. 
The primary audit team interacted regularly with the local EY full 
scope and specified procedures component teams where appropriate, 
during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers 
and were responsible for the scope and direction of the Group audit 
process. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with the 
component audit teams, in addition to holding formal meetings to 
ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and the results of 
their procedures. Close meetings for full, specific, and specified audit 
procedures components (excluding those performed by the primary 
audit team) were held via video conference in April 2024 and were 
attended by the Senior Statutory Auditor and/or other members of 
the primary audit team. This, together with the additional procedures 
performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Climate change 
Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will 
impact Vodafone Group Plc. The Group has determined that the most 
significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will 
be from its Planet activities and commitments set out on pages 38 to 
42 and the material climate-related physical and transitional risks 
explained on pages 64 to 69 in the required Task Force for Climate 
related Financial Disclosures, both of which form part of the “Other 
information,” rather than the audited consolidated financial 
statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore 
consisted solely of considering whether they are materially 
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained 
in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially 
misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”. 
In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential 
impacts of climate change on the Group’s business and any 
consequential material impact on its financial statements. 
As explained in Note 1 Basis of Preparation to the consolidated 
financial statements, environmental, regulatory and other factors 
responsive to climate change risks are still developing, and are 
outside of the Group’s control, and consequently financial statements 
cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet 
known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that 
they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and 
liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the 
requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards. The 
significant accounting estimates and judgements assessed by 
management to be potentially impacted by climate risks have been 
described in Note 1 and with further disclosure in respect of the 
impact on the Group’s long-range plans and deferred tax asset 
recognition provided in Note 4 and Note 6 respectively. 
Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the 
consolidated financial statements was focused on evaluating 
management’s assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and 
transition, their climate commitments, the effects of material climate 
risks disclosed on pages 64 to 69 and the significant judgements and 
estimates disclosed in note 1, 4 and 6 and whether these have been 
appropriately reflected in asset values and associated disclosures 
where values are determined through modelling future cash flows, 
being ‘Goodwill’, ‘Other intangible assets’ and ‘Deferred tax assets’, 
and in the timing and nature of liabilities recognised, being ‘Asset 
Retirement Obligations’. As part of this evaluation, we performed our 
own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal 
specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the 
financial statements from climate change which needed to be 
considered in our audit. 
The findings from our procedures supported our evaluation and 
challenge of the adequacy of climate change considerations in the 
Directors’ assessment of going concern and viability and associated 
disclosures. 
Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate 
change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to 
materially impact a key audit matter.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the 
current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These 
matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our 
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Risk
Carrying value of cash generating units, including goodwill
As more fully described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the Group calculates 
the value in use (‘VIU’) for cash generating units (‘CGUs’) to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying value of the CGU, and therefore, 
goodwill, is required. As at 31 March 2024, the Group has recorded €24,956 million (FY23: €27,615 million) of goodwill, including €20,335 million 
(FY23: €20,335 million) in respect of Germany.
The Group’s assessment of the VIU of its CGUs involves estimation about the future performance of the local market businesses. In particular, the 
determination of the VIU for Germany was sensitive to the significant assumptions of projected adjusted EBITDAaL growth, projected capital 
expenditure, the long-term growth rate, and the discount rate. 
Auditing the Group’s annual impairment test for the Germany CGU was complex and involved significant auditor judgement, given the estimation 
uncertainty related to the significant assumptions described above and the sensitivity to fluctuations in those assumptions, as well as market 
specific factors.
Our response to the risk
The recoverability of the Group’s Germany CGU carrying value was subject to full scope audit procedures performed by the primary audit team 
with support from the component audit team on certain procedures at the local market level.
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group’s goodwill impairment 
review process, including, for example, management’s controls over the significant assumptions described for the Germany VIU assessment 
above. 
For the annual impairment assessment as at 31 March 2024, we also evaluated, with the help of EY valuation specialists, the methodology 
applied in the Germany VIU model, as compared to the requirements of IAS 36, including the mathematical accuracy of management’s model. 
We performed procedures to assess the significant assumptions used in the Germany VIU model, including:
 – Evaluating projected adjusted EBITDAaL growth, for example by comparing underlying assumptions to external data, such as economic and 
industry forecasts for the German and European markets, supporting evidence provided by management, and for consistency with evidence 
obtained from other areas of our audit, including, for example, the results of our procedures described in ‘Recognition and recoverability of 
deferred tax assets on tax losses – Luxembourg’ below;
 – comparing the cash flow projections used in the Germany VIU model to the information approved by the Group’s Board of Directors and 
evaluating the historical accuracy of management’s business plans, which underpin the VIU model, by comparing prior years’ forecasts to 
actual results; 
 – comparing forecast capital expenditure to actual historical spend, market specific events such as fibre and 5G roll-out, industry analysis and 
competitor data, where available;
 – with the support of EY valuation specialists, comparing the long-term growth rate and discount rate assumptions to EY independently 
determined ranges;
 – performing sensitivity analyses on the above-described assumptions in the VIU model, to evaluate whether a reasonable change in 
assumptions would cause an impairment of the Germany CGU or indicate additional disclosures were appropriate; and
 – in considering the existence of contrary evidence, for management’s assessment of implied recoverable value, we compared the Germany 
CGU EBITDAaL multiple to market listed peers and considered independent analyst valuations for the Germany CGU, where available.
We also assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures provided in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, in particular the sensitivity 
disclosures in relation to reasonably possible changes in assumptions that could result in impairment.
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee
We agree with management’s conclusion that no impairment charge is required to be recognised in the year in respect of the Germany CGU. 
The disclosures in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Germany CGU are consistent with the requirements of IAS 36 
including the sensitivity disclosures, which reflect those changes in certain key assumptions that would eliminate the headroom of €2.3 billion.

Risk
Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses – Luxembourg
As more fully described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group recognises deferred tax assets in accordance with IAS 12 
Income Taxes, based on whether management judges that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits in the relevant legal entity or 
tax group to allow the recognised asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset in Luxembourg of €16,714 million (FY23: €16,269 million) has been recognised in respect of losses, as management 
concluded it is probable that the Luxembourg entities will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset 
will be recovered. Management estimates that the losses will be utilised, and the related deferred tax asset recovered, over a period of 52 to 57 
years (FY23: 35 to 39 years). 
The Luxembourg companies’ income is derived from the Group’s internal financing, procurement and roaming activities. The forecast future 
finance income can vary based on forecast interest rates and intercompany debt levels, in particular with Vodafone Germany, which in turn 
impacts the timeframe over which the deferred tax asset is forecast to be recovered. 
Furthermore, during the course of the year, the group recognised an additional €1,019 million (included within the €16,714 million above) of 
deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, in respect of losses that were not previously recognised, on the basis that it is now considered more likely 
than not that the related €4 billion of losses would not be successfully challenged by the European Commission under state aid rules.
Auditing the Group’s recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets in Luxembourg is significant to the audit because it involves material 
amounts, and the judgements and estimates in relation to future taxable profits and the period of time over which it is expected to utilise these 
assets, results in increased estimation uncertainty.
Our response to the risk
Audit procedures on the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets on tax losses in Luxembourg were performed by the primary audit 
team and its tax professionals, with support from Luxembourg tax and transfer pricing specialists for certain procedures.
We obtained an understanding and evaluated the design effectiveness of management’s controls around the recognition and recoverability of 
deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, including the calculation of the gross amount of deferred tax assets recorded and the preparation of the 
prospective financial information used to determine the Luxembourg entities’ future taxable income.
To test the recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax assets in Luxembourg, with the support of tax professionals and tax specialists, our 
audit procedures included, among others;
 – assessing the existence of available losses and evaluating management’s position on the recoverability of the losses with respect to local tax 
law and tax planning strategies adopted; 
 – in respect of the additional €1,019 million deferred tax asset recognised in the year, we reviewed the legal advice obtained by management 
and met with the Group’s external legal counsel to consider their interpretation of recent legal rulings in respect of recent European 
Commission state aid cases in Luxembourg and their application to the Group; 
 – evaluating the forecast finance income by, on a sample basis, recalculating income with reference to underlying agreements, comparing 
future interest rates utilised in the forecasts to relevant external benchmarks and the assumed projections in intra-group debt levels for 
consistency with our understanding of relevant guidance in respect of transfer pricing of financial transactions;
 – assessing whether contrary evidence exists that is not consistent with either management’s stated intention that the financing structures, as 
projected, as well as the debt levels in Vodafone Germany, will remain in place or that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will 
exist;
 – assessing the reasonability of forecasted procurement and roaming taxable profits utilised in management’s assessment, by considering 
historical forecasting accuracy, changes in pricing models, and with evidence obtained from other areas of our audit; 
 – performing sensitivities to understand the impact of changes in key assumptions of intra-group financing levels and forecast interest rates, on 
the utilisation timeframe given the Group does not currently recognise deferred tax assets which are forecast to be used 60 years beyond the 
balance sheet date; and
 – evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of the recognition of the deferred tax asset, including as it relates to the evidence 
supporting the recognition, judgements in respect of the utilisation profile, including longer term uncertainties and the key drivers of changes 
in the carrying value of the asset and the utilisation period.
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee
We agree with the recognition of the deferred tax assets and consequently the long recoverability period, on the basis of forecast profits, which are 
considered probable, given the commercial rationale and management’s intention to retain current activities in Luxembourg and the debt levels in 
Vodafone Germany, over the longer term, and the track record of historical profitability in the Luxembourg operations.
The increase in the period of utilisation in FY24 is consistent with expectations of future interest rate reductions, driving lower forecast taxable profits 
on forecast financing activities.
Changes in key assumptions, in particular a plausible reduction in the level of intra-group debt levels with Germany, could lead to an increase in 
utilisation period beyond 60 years. The Group does not currently recognise deferred tax assets which are forecast to be used 60 years beyond the 
balance sheet date and consequently, should the assumptions change, a different conclusion could be reached in respect of the level of deferred tax 
asset recognised.
We consider that the disclosures included within Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements acknowledges both the judgement made in respect 
of the timing and profile of the utilisation of the losses in the short to medium term and the longer-term uncertainties in relation to the carrying value 
of the related deferred tax asset.

Risk
Revenue recognition
As more fully described in Note 2, Note 14 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group reported revenue of €36,717 million 
(FY23: €37,672 million, after re-presentation for IFRS 5, contract assets of €2,863 million (FY23: €3,557 million) and contract liabilities of €1,908 
million (FY23: €2,543 million) for the year ended or as at 31 March 2024. Management records revenue according to the principles of IFRS 15, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, including following the 5-step model therein. 
We identified a risk of management override through inappropriate manual topside revenue journal entries, given revenue is a key performance 
indicator, both in external communication and for management incentives.
We also consider auditing the revenue recorded by the Group to involve greater auditor effort and attention, due to the multiple IT systems and 
tools utilised in the initiation, processing and recording of transactions, which includes a high volume of individually low monetary value 
transactions. The involvement of IT professionals was required to determine the audit approach to test and evaluate the relevant data that was 
captured and aggregated, and to assess the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained.
Our response to the risk
We performed full or specified audit procedures over this risk area in 7 full scope and 3 specified procedure components with significant revenue 
streams, which covered 79% of the Group’s revenue. 
Our audit procedures at full scope component locations included, among others obtaining an understanding of, evaluating the design and 
testing the operating effectiveness of controls over the Group’s revenue recognition process, which includes management’s determination of the 
timing of revenue recorded. With the support of our IT professionals, we also evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of 
controls over the appropriate flow of transactional data through the IT systems and tools and the reconciliation of the transactional data to the 
accounting records. For specified procedures components, we obtained an understanding of the design of controls over the revenue recognition 
process. 
For significant revenue streams, our audit procedures included the following, on a sample basis:
 – We used data analytic tools to identify revenue related manual journals posted to the general ledger and traced these back to underlying 
source documentation, to evaluate the propriety, completeness and accuracy of the postings. We also performed analytical procedures to 
consider the completeness of journal postings.
 – Where it was deemed to be most effective, at certain components we extended the use of data analytics. These incremental procedures 
involved testing full populations of transactions, including performing a correlation analysis between invoiced revenue, receivables and cash. 
We performed targeted audit procedures over material items that did not correlate as expected.
 – At components where the above procedures were not used, for the significant revenue billing systems, we obtained the billing data to general 
ledger reconciliation, which included the relevant adjustments to deferred and accrued revenue balances. We reperformed these 
reconciliations, including assessing the accuracy of the data inputs to underlying source documentation, including contractual agreements 
where applicable. In addition, we tested the mathematical accuracy and completeness of the reconciliations and material reconciling items, 
including significant revenue postings outside of the billing systems. 
 – We recalculated the revenue recognised to evaluate whether the processing of the revenue recognition by the Group’s IT systems was 
materially correct.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect to the accounting policies on revenue recognition.
Key observations communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee
Based on the procedures performed, including those in respect of manual adjustments to revenue, we concluded that revenue has been 
appropriately recognised in accordance with IFRS 15, in the year ended 31 March 2024.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the 
audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in 
the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. 
Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of 
our audit procedures. 
We determined our final materiality for the Group to be €220 million 
(2023: €300 million), which is 2% (2023: approximately 2%) of 
Adjusted EBITDAaL. We believe that Adjusted EBITDAaL provides us 
with the most relevant performance measure for the continuing 
business on which to determine materiality, given the prominence of 
this metric throughout the Annual Report and consolidated financial 
statements, investor presentations, profit metrics focused on by 
analysts and its alignment to the management remuneration metric 
of adjusted EBIT. 
We determined materiality for the Parent company to be €450 million 
(2023: €502 million), which is 1% (2023: 1%) of the Parent company’s 
equity. However, since the Parent company was a full scope 
component, for accounts that were relevant for the consolidated 
financial statements, a performance materiality of €33 million was 
applied.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial Group materiality 
(€260 million) after the classification of Vodafone Spain and Italy as 
discontinued operations, in accordance with IFRS 5. We did not 
change our basis or point in range as 2% of Adjusted EBITDAaL from 
continuing operations, remained the most relevant performance 
metric. Our audit procedures have been performed to our final 
materiality (€220 million). 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance 
level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s overall control environment to 
prevent or timely detect and correct material errors, our judgement 
was that performance materiality was 75% (2023: 75%) of our 
planning materiality, namely €165m (2023: €225m).
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit 
coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken 
based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The 
performance materiality set for each component is based on the 
relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and 
our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the 
current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to 
components was €33m to €165m (2023: €45m to €225m).
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as 
being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report 
to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of €11m (2023: 
€15m), which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below 
that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative 
grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of 
other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Other information 
The other information comprises the information included in the 
annual report set out on pages 1 to 124, other than the financial 
statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are 
responsible for the other information contained within the annual 
report. 
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other 
information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this 
report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. 
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with 
the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of 
the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we 
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material 
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise 
to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, 
based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of the other information, we are required to 
report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the 
audit:
 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ 
report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 – the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in

Matters on which we are required to report by 
exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the 
Parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the 
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic 
report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in 
relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the Parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are 
not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit
Corporate Governance Statement
We have reviewed the directors’ statement in relation to going 
concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate 
Governance Statement relating to the Group and Parent company’s 
compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.
Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have 
concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate 
Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:
 – Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of 
adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material 
uncertainties identified set out on page 124;
 – Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the company’s 
prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is 
appropriate set out on page 63;
 – Director’s statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its 
liabilities set out on page 63;
 – Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out 
on page 123;
 – Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of 
the emerging and principal risks set out on page 123;
 – The section of the annual report that describes the review of 
effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set 
out on pages 93 and 120; and;
 – The section describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee set 
out on pages 89 to 94
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set 
out on page 123, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine 
is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for 
assessing the Group and Parent company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of 
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in 
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these financial statements. 
Explanation as to what extent the audit was 
considered capable of detecting irregularities, 
including fraud 
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with 
laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our 
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including 
fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud 
is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or 
intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to 
which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including 
fraud is detailed below.
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection 
of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the 
company and management. 
 – We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory 
frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that 
the most significant are those that relate to the reporting 
framework (IFRS as Issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board, Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced 
disclosure framework’, (‘FRS 101’), the UK Companies Act 2006 and 
UK Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax compliance 
regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the 
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

 – We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks 
by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those 
responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company 
Secretary. We supplemented our enquiries through our review of 
board minutes and papers provided to the Audit and Risk 
Committee, correspondence received from regulatory bodies and 
attendance at all meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, as 
well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across 
the Group, including our testing of entity level and group-wide 
controls. 
 – We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements 
to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur, by 
meeting with management from various parts of the Group, 
including management and finance teams of the local markets 
designated as full, specific and specified procedures scope 
locations, Head Office, the Audit and Risk Committee, the Group 
Internal Audit function, the Group Legal function and individuals in 
the fraud and compliance department, to understand where it 
considered there was susceptibility to fraud; and assessing 
whistleblowing logs and associated incidences for those with a 
potential financial reporting impact. We also considered 
performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made 
by management to manage earnings or influence the perceptions 
of analysts. We considered the programmes and controls that the 
Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise 
prevent, deter and detect fraud, and how senior management 
monitors those programmes and controls. 
 – Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to 
identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations or 
fraudulent financial reporting, where the impact on the financial 
statements of such non-compliance or fraudulent financial 
reporting could be material. These procedures included, where 
necessary, the use of forensic and other relevant specialists. Our 
procedures involved enquiries of management at Head Office, the 
Audit and Risk Committee, the Group Internal Audit function, the 
Group legal function, the Group Corporate Security team, 
individuals in the fraud and compliance department (including 
those responsible for fraud investigation and whistleblowing). We 
also performed journal entry testing, with a focus on manual 
consolidation journals, journals indicating large or unusual 
transactions and journals with key words that could indicate 
management override, based on our understanding of the business; 
and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by 
management in respect of significant one-off transactions in the 
financial year and significant accounting estimates, as referred to in 
the key audit matters section above. At a component level, our full 
and specified procedure scope component audit teams’ 
procedures included enquiries of component management; journal 
entry testing; and testing in respect of the key audit matter of 
revenue recognition. We also leveraged our data analytics 
capabilities in performing work on the purchase to pay process and 
fixed asset balances and leases, to assist in identifying higher risk 
transactions and balances, for testing. We also used EY’s Document 
Authenticity Tool to analyse certain electronic documents used as 
audit evidence, to identify characteristics of documents that can be 
indicators of alteration or inauthenticity.
 – Where the risk of fraud, including the risk of management override, 
was considered to be higher, including areas impacting Group key 
performance indicators or management remuneration, we 
performed audit procedures to address each identified material 
fraud risk or other risk of material misstatement. These procedures 
included those on revenue recognition referred to in the key audit 
matters section above and testing journal entries that we judged to 
be of higher risk and were designed to provide reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements were free from material 
fraud or error.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the 
financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s 
website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This 
description forms part of our auditor’s report.
Other matters we are required to address 
 – Following the recommendation from the Audit & Risk Committee, 
we were appointed by the Parent company on 9 May 2023 to audit 
the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2023 and 
subsequent financial periods. 
 – The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous 
renewals and reappointments is five years, covering the years 
ending 31 March 2020 to 31 March 2024.
 – The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the 
Audit & Risk Committee.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in

Includes share premium, capital reserve, capital redemption reserve, merger reserve and share-based payment reserve. The merger reserve was derived from acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2004 and subsequently 
allocated to additional paid-in capital on adoption of IFRS. 
3 
The currency reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the assets and liabilities of foreign operations. These differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation. 
4 
The revaluation surplus derives from acquisitions of subsidiaries made before the Group’s adoption of IFRS 3 (Revised) on 1 April 2010 and comprises the amounts arising from recognising the Group’s pre-existing equity 
interest in the acquired subsidiary at fair value. 
5 
Principally includes the impact of the Group’s cash flow hedges with €2,037 million net loss deferred to other comprehensive income/(expense) during the year (2023: €2,322 million net gain; 2022: €3,704 million net gain) 
and €254 million net gain (2023: €896 million net gain; 2022: €1,422 million net gain) recycled to the consolidated income statement. These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on fixed borrowings, with 
any foreign exchange on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the consolidated income statement over the life of the hedges, up to 2063. See note 22 
‘Capital and financial risk management’.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
 
 
1. Basis of preparation  
This section describes the critical accounting judgements and estimates that management has identified as having a 
potentially material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements and sets out our significant accounting 
policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a 
specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. We have also detailed below the new 
accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our 
financial reporting. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’), with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’). The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis (see page 124).    
Vodafone Group Plc is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales (registration number 1833679). The registered address of the Company is 
Vodafone House, The Connection, Newbury, Berkshire, RG14 2FN, England. 
IFRS requires the Directors to adopt accounting policies that are the most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances. These have been applied 
consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. In determining and applying accounting policies, Directors and management are 
required to make judgements and estimates in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting judgement, estimate or assumption 
to be followed could materially affect the Group’s reported financial position, results or cash flows and disclosure of contingent assets or liabilities 
during the reporting period; it may later be determined that a different choice may have been more appropriate. 
The Group’s critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty are detailed below. Actual outcomes could differ from those 
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if 
the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Management regularly reviews, and revises as necessary, the accounting judgements that significantly impact the amounts recognised in the 
financial statements and the estimates that are considered to be ‘critical estimates’ due to their potential to give rise to material adjustments in the 
Group’s financial statements in the year to 31 March 2025. As at 31 March 2024, management has identified critical judgements in respect of 
revenue recognition, lease accounting, the recognition of deferred tax assets, the accounting for tax disputes, valuing assets and liabilities acquired 
in business combinations, the classification of joint arrangements, whether to recognise provisions or to disclose contingent liabilities, held for sale 
accounting and the impacts of climate change. In addition, management has identified critical accounting estimates in relation to the recovery of 
deferred tax assets, post employment benefits and impairment reviews; estimates have also been identified that are not considered to be critical in 
respect of the allocation of revenue to goods and services, the useful economic lives of finite lived intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment. 
The majority of the Group’s provisions are either long-term in nature (such as asset retirement obligations) or relate to shorter-term liabilities (such 
as those relating to restructuring and property) where there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial year. 
Critical judgements exercised in respect of tax disputes include cases in India and a tax dispute related to financing costs in the Netherlands.  
These critical accounting judgements, estimates and related disclosures have been discussed with the Group’s Audit and Risk Committee.  
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty  
Revenue recognition  
Revenue recognition under IFRS 15 necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the use of management 
judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements and source of estimation uncertainty are 
disclosed below.  
Gross versus net presentation 
If the Group has control of goods or services when they are delivered to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer; 
otherwise the Group is acting as an agent. Whether the Group is considered to be the principal or an agent in the transaction depends on analysis by 
management of both the legal form and substance of the agreement between the Group and its business partners; such judgements impact the 
amount of reported revenue and operating expenses (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’) but do not impact reported 
assets, liabilities or cash flows. Scenarios requiring judgement to determine whether the Group is a principal or an agent include, for example, those 
where the Group delivers third-party branded software or services (such as premium music, TV content or cloud-based services) to customers and 
those where goods or services are delivered to customers in partnership with a third-party.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
1. Basis of preparation (continued)  
Allocation of revenue to goods and services provided to customers 
Revenue is recognised when goods and services are delivered to customers (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’). Goods and 
services may be delivered to a customer at different times under the same contract, hence it is necessary to allocate the amount payable by the 
customer between goods and services on a ‘relative standalone selling price basis’; this requires the identification of performance obligations 
(‘obligations’) and the determination of standalone selling prices for the identified obligations. The determination of obligations is, for the primary goods 
and services sold by the Group, not considered to be a critical accounting judgement; the Group’s policy on identifying obligations is disclosed in note 2 
‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’. The determination of standalone selling prices for identified obligations is discussed below.  
It is necessary to estimate the standalone price when the Group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone 
basis. When estimating the standalone price the Group maximises the use of external inputs; methods for estimating standalone prices include 
determining the standalone price of similar goods and services sold by the Group, observing the standalone prices for similar goods and services when 
sold by third parties or using a cost-plus reasonable margin approach (which is sometimes the case for devices and other equipment). Where it is not 
possible to reliably estimate standalone prices due to a lack of observable standalone sales or highly variable pricing, which is sometimes the case for 
services, the standalone price of an obligation may be determined as the transaction price less the standalone prices of other obligations in the contract. 
The standalone price determined for obligations materially impacts the allocation of revenue between obligations and impacts the timing of revenue 
when obligations are provided to customers at different times – for example, the allocation of revenue between devices, which are usually delivered up-
front, and services which are typically delivered over the contract period. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment 
to the carrying value of contract-related assets or liabilities in the 12 months after the balance sheet date if these estimates were revised. 
Lease accounting 
Lease accounting under IFRS 16 is complex and necessitates the collation and processing of very large amounts of data and the increased use of 
management judgements and estimates to produce financial information. The most significant accounting judgements are disclosed below.  
Lease identification 
Whether the arrangement is considered a lease or a service contract depends on the analysis by management of both the legal form and substance of 
the arrangement between the Group and the counter-party to determine if control of an identified asset has been passed between the parties; if not, the 
arrangement is a service arrangement. Control exists if the Group obtains substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset, and has the 
ability to direct its use, for a period of time. An identified asset exists where an agreement explicitly or implicitly identifies an asset or a physically distinct 
portion of an asset which the lessor has no substantive right to substitute. 
The scenarios requiring the greatest judgement include those where the arrangement is for the use of fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines. 
Generally, where the Group has exclusive use of a physical line it is determined that the Group can also direct the use of the line and therefore leases will 
be recognised. Where the Group provides access to fibre or other fixed telecommunication lines to another operator on a wholesale basis the 
arrangement will generally be identified as a lease, whereas when the Group provides fixed line services to an end-user, generally control over such lines 
is not passed to the end-user and a lease is not identified. 
Where the Group contracts with tower companies to utilise space on a tower for the placement of transmission equipment for a period of time, the 
arrangement will generally be identified as a lease. 
The impact of determining whether an agreement is a lease or a service depends on whether the Group is a potential lessee or lessor in the arrangement 
and, where the Group is a lessor, whether the arrangement is classified as an operating or finance lease. The impacts for each scenario are described 
below where the Group is potentially: 
- A lessee. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both costs and reported assets and liabilities. A lease results in an asset and a liability being 
reported and depreciation and interest being recognised; the interest charge will decrease over the life of the lease. A service contract results in 
operating expenses being recognised evenly over the life of the contract and no assets or liabilities being recorded (other than trade payables, 
prepayments and accruals). 
- An operating lessor. The judgement impacts the nature of income recognised. An operating lease results in lease income being recognised whilst a 
service contract results in service revenue. Both are recognised evenly over the life of the contract. 
- A finance lessor. The judgement impacts the nature and timing of both income and reported assets. A finance lease results in the lease income being 
recognised at commencement of the lease and an asset (the net investment in the lease) being recorded. 
Lease term 
Where leases include additional optional periods after an initial lease term, significant judgement is required in determining whether these optional 
periods should be included when determining the lease term. The impact of this judgement is significantly greater where the Group is a lessee. As a 
lessee, optional periods are included in the lease term if the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise an extension option or will not exercise a 
termination option; this depends on an analysis by management of all relevant facts and circumstances including the leased asset’s nature and purpose, 
the economic and practical potential for replacing the asset and any plans that the Group has in place for the future use of the asset. Where a leased 
asset is highly customised (either when initially provided or as a result of leasehold improvements) or it is impractical or uneconomic to replace then the 
Group is more likely to judge that lease extension options are reasonably certain to be exercised. The value of the right-of-use asset and lease liability will 
be greater when extension options are included in the lease term. The normal approach adopted for lease term by asset class is described below.

The lease terms can vary significantly by type and use of asset and geography. In addition, the exact lease term is subject to the non-cancellable period 
and rights and options in each contract. Generally, lease terms are judged to be the longer of the non-cancellable term and: 
- Between 5 and 10 years for land and buildings (excluding retail), with terms at the top end of this range if the lease relates to assets that are considered 
to be difficult to exit sooner for economic, practical or reputational reasons; 
- The period to the next contractual lease break date for retail premises (excluding breaks within the next 12 months); 
- The lease term, or useful economic life, of the assets connected for leases that are used to provide internal connectivity;   
- The customer service agreement length for leases of local loop connections or other assets required to provide fixed line or other services to 
individual customers; and 
- 5 years where the Group has leases for the use of space on towers for the placement of transmission equipment.   
In most instances the Group has options to renew or extend leases for additional periods after the end of the lease term which are assessed using the 
criteria above. 
Lease terms are reassessed if a significant event or change in circumstances occurs relating to the leased assets that is within the control of the Group; 
such changes usually relate to commercial agreements entered into by the Group, or business decisions made by the Group.  Where such changes 
change the Group’s assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise options to extend, or not terminate leases, then the lease term is 
reassessed and the lease liability is remeasured, which in most cases will increase the lease liability.  
Taxation 
The Group’s tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge 
involves estimation and judgement in respect of certain matters, being principally: 
Recognition of deferred tax assets 
Significant items on which the Group has exercised accounting estimation and judgement include the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect 
of losses in Luxembourg, Germany, Italy1 and Spain1 as well as capital allowances in the United Kingdom. The recognition of deferred tax assets, 
particularly in respect of tax losses, is based upon whether management judge that it is probable that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable 
profits in the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The Group assesses the availability of future taxable 
profits using the same undiscounted five year forecasts for the Group’s operations as are used in the Group’s value in use calculations (see note 4 
‘Impairment losses’). In the case of Luxembourg, this includes forecasts of future income from the Group’s internal financing, centralised 
procurement and roaming activities.  
Where tax losses are forecast to be recovered beyond the five year period, the availability of taxable profits is assessed using the cash flows and long-
term growth rates used for the value in use calculations. 
The estimated cash flows inherent in these forecasts include the unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business including the 
potential impacts of changes in the market structure, trends in customer pricing, the costs associated with the acquisition and retention of 
customers, future technological evolutions and potential regulatory changes, such as our ability to acquire and/or renew spectrum licences. 
Changes in the estimates which underpin the Group’s forecasts could have an impact on the amount of future taxable profits and could have a 
significant impact on the period over which the deferred tax asset would be recovered. 
The Group only considers substantively enacted tax laws when assessing the amount and availability of tax losses to offset against the future taxable 
profits. See note 6 ‘Taxation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
See additional commentary relating to climate change below.    
Uncertain tax positions 
The tax impact of a transaction or item can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. The 
Group uses in-house tax experts when assessing uncertain tax positions and seeks the advice of external professional advisors where appropriate. 
The most significant judgements in this area relate to the Group’s tax disputes in India and a tax dispute related to financing costs in the Netherlands. 
Further details of tax disputes are included in note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
When the Group completes a business combination, the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets, are 
recognised. The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s judgement. If the 
purchase consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired then the incremental amount paid is recognised as goodwill. If the purchase 
price consideration is lower than the fair value of the assets acquired then the difference is recorded as a gain in the income statement.  
Allocation of the purchase price between finite lived assets (discussed below) and indefinite lived assets such as goodwill affects the subsequent results 
of the Group as finite lived intangible assets are amortised, whereas indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortised.  
See note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ to the consolidated financial statements for further details.  
Note: 
1  Deferred tax assets in respect of losses in Vodafone Italy and Vodafone Spain are reported with Assets held for sale. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more 
information.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
1. Basis of preparation (continued)  
Joint arrangements 
The Group participates in a number of joint arrangements where control of the arrangement is shared with one or more other parties. Judgement is 
required to classify joint arrangements in a separate legal entity as either a joint operation or as a joint venture, which depends on management’s 
assessment of the legal form and substance of the arrangement taking into account relevant facts and circumstances such as whether the owners have 
rights to substantially all the economic outputs and, in substance, settle the liabilities of the entity. 
The classification can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and 
cash flows of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis, whereas the Group’s investment and share of 
results of joint ventures are shown within single line items in the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated income statement 
respectively. See note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint arrangements’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
Finite lived intangible assets 
Other intangible assets include amounts spent by the Group acquiring licences and spectrum, customer bases and the costs of purchasing and 
developing computer software. 
Where intangible assets are acquired through business combinations and no active market for the assets exists, the fair value of these assets is 
determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset. Estimates relating to the future cash flows and discount rates used 
may have a material effect on the reported amounts of finite lived intangible assets. 
Estimation of useful life 
The useful life over which intangible assets are amortised depends on management’s estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived 
from the asset. Useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate. Management’s estimates of useful life have a material 
impact on the amount of amortisation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying 
values of intangible assets in the year to 31 March 2025 if these estimates were revised. The basis for determining the useful life for the most significant 
categories of intangible assets are discussed below.  
Customer bases 
The estimated useful life principally reflects management’s view of the average economic life of the customer base and is assessed by reference to 
customer churn rates. An increase in churn rates may lead to a reduction in the estimated useful life and an increase in the amortisation charge. 
Capitalised software  
For computer software, the estimated useful life is based on management’s view, considering historical experience with similar products as well as 
anticipation of future events which may impact their life such as changes in technology. The useful life will not exceed the duration of a licence. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment represents 19.7% of the Group’s total assets (2023: 24.4%). Estimates and assumptions made may have a material impact 
on their carrying value and related depreciation charge. See note 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ to the consolidated financial statements for further 
details. 
Estimation of useful life 
The depreciation charge for an asset is derived using estimates of its expected useful life and expected residual value, which are reviewed annually. 
Management’s estimates of useful life have a material impact on the amount of depreciation recorded in the year, but there is not considered to be a 
significant risk of material adjustment to the carrying values of property, plant and equipment in the year to 31 March 2025 if these estimates were 
revised.  
Management determines the useful lives and residual values for assets when they are acquired, based on experience with similar assets and taking into 
account other relevant factors such as any expected changes in technology.  
See additional commentary relating to climate change, below.  
Post employment benefits 
Management uses estimates when determining the Group’s liabilities and expenses arising for defined benefit pension schemes. Management is 
required to estimate the future rates of inflation, salary increases, discount rates and longevity of members, each of which may have a material impact on 
the defined benefit obligations that are recorded. Further details, including a sensitivity analysis, are included in note 25 ‘Post employment benefits’ to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
In addition, plan assets are recognised at fair value at the reporting date in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’.  Where assets do not have 
observable prices, estimation is necessary to determine fair values.  In estimating fair value, market-observable data is used to the extent it is available.   
Contingent liabilities 
The Group exercises judgement to determine whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigations or 
other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities (see 
note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements). Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a 
pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise.

Impairment reviews 
IFRS requires management to perform impairment tests annually for indefinite lived assets, for finite lived assets and for equity accounted 
investments if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  
Management is required to make significant judgements concerning the identification of impairment indicators and the determination of 
recoverable amounts for its assets which are based on the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use. Observable market data 
on fair values for equivalent assets is often limited and, for a number of reasons, transaction values agreed as part of any business acquisition or 
disposal may be higher than the assessed value in use.   
The Group performs an annual impairment test which focuses on determining the recoverable amounts for its assets based on value in use, being 
the present value of the future cash flows it expects to generate from the continuing use of its assets or cash-generating units.   
Calculating the net present value of the future cash flows requires estimates to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including 
management’s expectations of: 
− Growth in Adjusted EBITDAaL, (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’ for a reconciliation to the consolidated income 
statement); 
− Timing and amount of future capital expenditure, licence and spectrum payments; 
− Long-term growth rates; and  
− Discount rates that reflect the future cash flows.  
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular projected Adjusted EBITDAaL, long-term growth rate and discount rate 
assumptions, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profit or loss. Further details, including a 
sensitivity analysis, are included in note 4 ‘Impairment losses’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
Where the Group has interests in listed entities, market data, such as share price, is used to assess the fair value of those interests. If the market 
capitalisation indicates that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, possible adjustments to the share price are reviewed and, where 
information is available, a value in use calculation is performed to support a conclusion on impairment. 
For operations that are classified as held for sale, management is required to determine whether the carrying value of the discontinued operation 
can be supported by the fair value less costs to sell. Where not observable in a quoted market, management has determined fair value less costs to 
sell by reference to the outcomes from the application of a number of potential valuation techniques, determined from inputs other than quoted 
prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
See additional commentary relating to climate change, below.  
Held for sale accounting 
When the value of a non-current asset or a group of assets in a disposal group will be primarily recovered through a sale transaction and there is an 
active plan for the disposal such that it is highly probable that the disposal will be completed within 12 months (subject to certain matters outside of 
the Group’s control) then the related assets will be classified as held for sale and, where appropriate, as a discontinued operation.    
Judgement is applied by management in determining if assets meet the requirements to be classified as held for sale and, where appropriate, as 
discontinued operations.  Further detail is provided in note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’. 
Climate change 
The potential climate change-related risks and opportunities to which the Group is exposed, as identified by management, are disclosed in the 
Group’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) on pages 64 to 69. Management has assessed the potential financial impacts 
relating to the identified risks, primarily considering the useful lives of, and retirement obligations for, property, plant and equipment, the possibility 
of impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets and the recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets. Management has exercised 
judgement in concluding that there are no further material financial impacts of the Group’s climate-related risks and opportunities on the 
consolidated financial statements. These judgements will be kept under review by management as the future impacts of climate change depend on 
environmental, regulatory and other factors outside of the Group’s control which are not all currently known.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
1. Basis of preparation (continued)  
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a 
whole 
Accounting convention 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been 
measured at fair value and for the application of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ for the Group’s entities reporting in 
Turkish lira and its associate’s reporting in Ethiopian birr (see below).  
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries controlled by the Company (see note 31 
‘Related undertakings’ to the consolidated financial statements), joint operations that are subject to joint control and the results of joint ventures 
and associates (see note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint arrangements’ to the consolidated financial statements). 
Hyperinflationary economies 
The Turkish and Ethiopian economies were designated as hyperinflationary from 30 June 2022 and 31 December 2022, respectively. The Group has 
applied IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’ to its Turkish and Ethiopian operations whose functional currencies are Turkish 
lira and Ethiopian birr from 1 April 2022. 
In applying IAS 29, the Turkish lira and Ethiopian birr results and non-monetary asset and liability balances for relevant financial years have been 
revalued to their present value equivalent local currency amounts at the reporting date, based on the consumer price indexes issued by the Turkish 
Statistical Institute and the Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia respectively. Comparative periods are not restated per IAS 21 ‘The Effects of 
Changes in Foreign Exchange rates’.  The respective indices have risen by 68.5% and 26.2% (2023: 50.5% and 31.3% ) during this financial year.  The 
revalued balances are translated to euros at the reporting date exchange rate of €1: 34.94 TRL and €1: 61.43 ETB (2023: €1: 20.85 TRL and €1:58.59 
ETB) respectively applying IAS 21.  
For the Group’s operations in Turkey: 
− The gain or loss on the revaluation of net monetary assets resulting from IAS 29 application is recognised in the consolidated income 
statement within Other income.  
− The Group also presents the gain or loss on cash and cash equivalents as monetary items together with the effect of inflation on operating, 
investing and financing cash flows as one number in the consolidated statement of cash flows.  
− The Group has presented the equity revaluation effects and the impact of currency movements within other comprehensive income as such 
amounts are judged to meet the definition of ‘exchange differences’.  
For Safaricom’s operations in Ethiopia, the impacts are reflected as an increase to Investments in associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated 
statement of financial position and an increase to Share of results of equity accounted associates and joint ventures recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement.   
The main impacts of the aforementioned adjustments for the Group’s Turkish and Ethiopian operations on the consolidated financial statements 
are shown below.

In addition, it is expected that Egypt will meet the requirements to be designated as a hyperinflationary economy under IAS 29 before 31 December 
2024.  If the Egyptian economy is designed as hyperinflationary, the Group’s financial reporting relating to its operations in Egypt during the year 
ending 31 March 2025 will be in accordance with IAS 29 applying the Group’s policy detailed above. 
Foreign currencies 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euro, which is also the Company’s functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines 
its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.  
With the exception of the Group’s Turkish lira operations and Safaricom’s Ethiopian birr operations, which are subject to hyperinflation accounting 
(see above), transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the entity at the rates 
prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 
Share capital, share premium and other capital reserves are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction 
and are not retranslated.  
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of entities with a functional currency other than euro are 
expressed in euro using exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period date. 
Income and expense items and cash flows are translated at the average exchange rates for each month and exchange differences arising are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the cumulative amount previously recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated 
income statement.  
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and 
translated accordingly. 
The net foreign exchange loss recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 March 2024 is €272 million (31 March 2023: 
€111 million gain; 2022: €309 million loss). The net gains and net losses are recorded within operating profit (2024: €110 million charge; 2023: 
€247 million credit; 2022: €24 million charge), financing costs (2024: €173 million charge; 2023: €135 million charge; 2022: €284 million charge) 
and income tax expense (2024: €11 million credit; 2023: €1 million charge; 2022: €1 million charge). The foreign exchange gains and losses 
included within other income arise on the disposal of subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures, associates and investments from the recycling of 
foreign exchange gains and losses previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Current or non-current classification 
Assets are classified as current in the consolidated statement of financial position where recovery is expected within 12 months of the reporting 
date. All assets where recovery is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date and all deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment and investments in associates and joint ventures are reported as non-current. 
Liabilities are classified as current unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the 
reporting date. For provisions, where the timing of settlement is uncertain, amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected 
more than 12 months from the reporting date. In addition, deferred tax liabilities and post-employment benefits are reported as non-current. 
Inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted average costs and comprises direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present 
location and condition.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
1. Basis of preparation (continued)  
New accounting pronouncements adopted on 1 April 2023  
The Group adopted the following new accounting policies on 1 April 2023 to comply with new standards issued and amendments to IFRS:  
− IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’; 
− Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Disclosure of Accounting Policies’; 
− Amendment to IAS 8 ‘Definition of Accounting Estimates’; 
− Amendment to IAS 12 ‘Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction’; and 
− Amendment to IAS 12 ‘International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules’.   
The amendments to IAS 1, IAS 8 and IAS 12 do not have a material impact on the Group’s financial reporting on adoption. The impact of the 
adoption of IFRS 17 and of the IAS 12 Pillar Two Model Rules is addressed below.  
IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ 
IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ was adopted by the Group on 1 April 2023. The Standard sets out revised principles for the recognition, measurement, 
presentation, and disclosure of obligations relating to insurance contracts issued by preparers in order to provide a single accounting model for all 
types of insurance.  
The Group issues certain short and long-term contracts, primarily being (i) the reinsurance of handset and other device insurance issued by a 
fronting insurer to the Group’s customers; and (ii) the reinsurance of a third-party annuity policy issued to the Vodafone and Cable & Wireless 
(‘CWW’) sections of the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (refer to note 25 ‘Post employment benefits’). The adoption of IFRS 17 did not have a 
material impact on prior period equity.  
The adoption of IFRS 17 results in separate insurance and reinsurance liability line items being presented within the Trade and other payables 
disclosure note to the consolidated financial statements, with corresponding reductions in the Trade payables and Other payables line items (see 
note 15 ‘Trade and other payables’). The reclassification as at 31 March 2023 amounts to €257 million and €63 million within the Non-current and 
Current Trade and other payables notes, respectively. The Non-current and Current Insurance and reinsurance liability amounts included within 
Trade and other payables at 31 March 2024 are €254 million and €48 million, respectively.  The adoption has not resulted in any material 
adjustments to any other balances or primary statements including equity or to the consolidated income statement. 
Amendments to IAS 12 ‘International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules’ 
On 23 May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ to provide a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting for deferred 
taxes arising in relation to International Tax Reform (the ‘Pillar Two’ rules) and to require additional disclosures regarding the impact of the Pillar Two 
regulations.  The amendments to IAS 12 have been adopted by the Group for the purposes of reporting at 31 March 2024, with additional disclosure 
also required in the year commencing 1 April 2024. 
The Group has applied the mandatory temporary exception and therefore has not recognised or disclosed deferred tax assets or liabilities relating to 
Pillar Two regulations within the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024.  The introduction of Pillar Two regulations is 
not expected to result in any material future impact on the Group’s current tax expense.  
See note 6 ‘Taxation’ for further details.

New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2024 
The following amendments have been issued by the IASB and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. These 
amendments have been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board. 
− Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current’ and ‘Non-current Liabilities with Covenants’;  
− Amendments to IFRS 16 ‘Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback’; and 
− Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 ‘Supplier Finance Arrangements’. 
The impact of adopting the above two amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ is discussed below. No impact is expected from 
the adoption of the amendments to IFRS 16. The Group will provide additional disclosures in future Annual Reports in respect of supplier 
arrangements as a result of the option of the amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7.  
Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ 
The Group classifies balances relating to certain bonds as current liabilities if it is the Group’s intention to exercise options to redeem them within 12 
months of the reporting date.  Following the adoption of the IAS 1 amendments on 1 April 2024, bonds that are repayable in more than 12 months 
will be classified as Non-current liabilities regardless of any intention to redeem the bonds early.  The impact of adopting the amendments on the 
consolidated statement of financial position at 31 March 2024 is a €931 million (31 March 2023: €2,013 million; 1 April 2022: €nil) reduction to the 
value of bonds presented within Current borrowings which will be re-presented as bonds within Non-current borrowings.   
The Group’s financial reporting will be presented in accordance with these standards from 1 April 2024 as applicable. 
New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2025 
The following new standards and amendments have been issued by the IASB but have not yet been endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board. 
− IFRS 18 ‘Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements’; and 
− Amendments to IAS 21‘Lack of Exchangeability’. 
IFRS 18 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027 whilst the amendments to IAS 21 is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2025.  
The Group is assessing the impact of these new standards and amendments and the Group’s financial reporting will be presented in accordance 
with these standards from 1 April 2025 or subsequently as applicable.

2. Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis 
The Group’s businesses are managed on a geographical basis. Selected financial data is presented on this basis below.  
Accounting policies 
Revenue  
When the Group enters into an agreement with a customer, goods and services deliverable under the contract are identified as separate 
performance obligations (‘obligations’) to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own and that the separate 
goods and services are considered distinct from other goods and services in the agreement. Where individual goods and services do not meet the 
criteria to be identified as separate obligations they are aggregated with other goods and/or services in the agreement until a separate obligation is 
identified. The obligations identified will depend on the nature of individual customer contracts, but might typically be separately identified for 
mobile handsets, other equipment such as set-top boxes and routers provided to customers and services provided to customers such as mobile and 
fixed line communication services. The Group’s digital services and Internet of Things (‘IoT’) customer offers typically include separate obligations 
for communications services, as well as equipment and software or software as a service (‘SaaS’). Where goods and services have a functional 
dependency (for example, a fixed line router can only be used with the Group’s services) this does not, in isolation, prevent those goods or services 
from being assessed as separate obligations. Activities relating to connecting customers to the Group’s network for the future provision of services 
are not considered to meet the criteria to be recognised as obligations except to the extent that the control of related equipment passes to 
customers.  
The Group determines the transaction price to which it expects to be entitled in return for providing the promised obligations to the customer based 
on the committed contractual amounts, net of sales taxes and discounts. Where indirect channel dealers, such as retailers, acquire customer 
contracts on behalf of the Group and receive commission, any commissions that the dealer is compelled to use to fund discounts or other 
incentives to the customer are treated as payments to the customer when determining the transaction price and consequently are not included in 
contract acquisition costs. 
The transaction price is allocated between the identified obligations according to the relative standalone selling prices of the obligations. The 
standalone selling price of each obligation deliverable in the contract is determined according to the prices that the Group would achieve by selling 
the same goods and/or services included in the obligation to a similar customer on a standalone basis; where standalone selling prices are not 
directly observable, estimation techniques are used maximising the use of external inputs. See ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 for details. Revenue is recognised when the respective obligations in the contract are delivered to the customer 
and cash collection is considered probable. Revenue for the provision of services, such as mobile airtime, fixed line broadband, other 
communications services and SaaS, is recognised when the Group provides the related service during the agreed service period. 
Revenue for device sales to end customers is generally recognised when the device is delivered to the end customer. For device sales made to 
intermediaries such as indirect channel dealers, revenue is recognised if control of the device has transferred to the intermediary and the 
intermediary has no right to return the device to receive a refund; otherwise revenue recognition is deferred until sale of the device to an end 
customer by the intermediary or the expiry of any right of return. 
Where refunds are issued to customers they are deducted from revenue in the relevant service period. 
When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, then the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer. As a 
principal, receipts from, and payments to, suppliers are reported on a gross basis in revenue and operating costs. If another party has control of 
goods or services prior to transfer to a customer, then the Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue in respect of the relevant 
obligations is recognised net of any related payments to the supplier and recognised revenue represents the margin earned by the Group. See 
‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 for details. 
Customers typically pay in advance for prepay mobile services and monthly for other communication services. Customers typically pay for handsets 
and other equipment either up-front at the time of sale or over the term of the related service agreement.  
When revenue recognised in respect of a customer contract exceeds amounts received or receivable from a customer at that time a contract asset 
is recognised; contract assets will typically be recognised for handsets or other equipment provided to customers where payment is recovered by 
the Group via future service fees. Once the amount receivable becomes conditional only on the passage of time, the contract asset becomes a trade 
receivable (see note 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’). If amounts received or receivable from a customer exceed revenue recognised for a contract, 
for example if the Group receives an advance payment from a customer, a contract liability is recognised. 
When contract assets or liabilities are recognised, a financing component may exist in the contract; this is typically the case when a handset or other 
equipment is provided to a customer up-front but payment is received over the term of the related service agreement, in which case the customer is 
deemed to have received financing. If a significant financing component is provided to the customer, the transaction price is reduced and interest 
revenue is recognised over the customer’s payment period using an interest rate reflecting the relevant central bank rates and customer credit risk. 
Contract-related costs 
When costs directly relating to a specific contract are incurred prior to recognising revenue for a related obligation, and those costs enhance the 
ability of the Group to deliver an obligation and are expected to be recovered, then those costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of 
financial position as fulfilment costs and are recognised as expenses in line with the recognition of revenue when the related obligation is delivered. 
The direct and incremental costs of acquiring a contract including, for example, certain commissions payable to staff or agents for acquiring 
customers on behalf of the Group, are recognised as contract acquisition cost assets in the consolidated statement of financial position when the 
related payment obligation is recorded. Costs are recognised as an expense in line with the recognition of the related revenue that is expected to be 
earned by the Group; typically this is over the customer contract period as new commissions are payable on contract renewal. Certain amounts 
payable to agents are deducted from revenue recognised (see above).

Segmental analysis 
The Group’s operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating 
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group has determined the chief operating decision maker 
to be its Chief Executive. The Group has a single group of similar services and products, being the supply of communications services and related 
products.  
On 1 April 2023, the Group revised its segments by moving Vodafone Egypt from the Other Markets segment to the Vodacom segment, following 
the transfer of Vodafone Egypt to the Vodacom group in December 2022. Consequently, the Vodacom segment has been re-named to ‘Africa’ and 
the Other Markets segment has been re-named to ‘Turkey’ because this segment comprised only Vodafone Turkey during the year ended 31 March 
2024.    
In October 2023 and March 2024, the Group announced the planned disposals of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy, respectively. Consequently, 
Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy have been classified as discontinued operations and are therefore no longer reporting segments of the Group.  
Revenue is attributed to a country based on the location of the Group company reporting the revenue. Transactions between operating segments 
are charged at arm’s-length prices.  
The operating segments for Germany, UK and Africa are individually material for the Group and are each reporting segments for which certain 
financial information is provided.  In addition, the Vantage Towers operating segment was a separately listed part of the Group until its disposal into a 
joint venture on 22 March 2023 (see note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’) and is presented as a reporting segment until the date of its disposal as it is 
considered to provide useful information to users of the financial statements. The aggregation of smaller operating segments into the Other Europe 
and Turkey reporting segments reflects, in the opinion of management, the similar local market economic characteristics and regulatory 
environments for each of those operating segments as well as the similar products and services sold and comparable classes of customers. In the 
case of the Other Europe region (comprising Albania, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary (until its disposal on 31 January 2023), Ireland, Portugal and 
Romania), this largely reflects membership or a close association with the European Union, whilst the Turkey segment (comprising Turkey and 
Ghana until its disposal on 21 February 2023) sits outside the European Union and has different economic and regulatory environment 
characteristics. Common Functions is a separate reporting segment and comprises activities which are undertaken primarily in central Group 
entities that do not meet the criteria for aggregation with other reporting segments.  
A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDAaL, the Group’s measure of segment profit, to the Group’s profit or loss before taxation for the financial year is 
shown below.

3 The results for the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued 
operations and are therefore excluded. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more information.  
4 The comparative years also include the results of Vodafone Hungary which, as previously reported, was sold in January 2023.  
5 From 1 April 2023, the Group revised its segmental reporting by moving Vodafone Egypt to the Africa segment. The comparatives have been re-presented on the new basis of segmental 
reporting. There is no impact on previously reported Group metrics.  
6 The Turkey segment comprises only Vodafone Turkey in the year ended 31 March 2024. The comparative years also include the results of Vodafone Ghana which, as previously reported, was 
sold in February 2023.  
The total future revenue from the remaining term of Group’s contracts with customers for performance obligations not yet delivered to those 
customers at 31 March 2024 is €16,577 million (re-presented7 2023: €16,354 million; 2022: €17,902 million); of which €10,488 million (re-
presented7 2023: €10,324 million; 2022: €11,353 million) is expected to be recognised within the next year and the majority of the remaining 
amount in the following 12 months.  
Notes: 
7 The results for the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued

4. Impairment losses 
Impairment occurs when the carrying value of assets is greater than the present value of the net cash flows they are 
expected to generate. We review the carrying value of assets for each country in which we operate at least annually. For 
further details of our impairment review process see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
Accounting policies 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows, known as cash-
generating units. The determination of the Group’s cash-generating units is primarily based on the geographic area where the Group supplies 
communications services and products. If cash flows from assets within one jurisdiction are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets 
in that same jurisdiction and management monitors performance separately, multiple cash-generating units are identified within that geographic 
area.   
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce 
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of 
each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversible in subsequent periods. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
Management prepares formal five year plans for the Group’s cash-generating units, which are the basis for the value in use calculations. 
Property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity accounted investments 
At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment, finite lived intangible assets and equity-
accounted investments to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to 
estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset 
belongs. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or 
cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated income 
statement. 
Where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss 
reversal is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. 
Impairment review 
Following our annual impairment review, no impairments were recognised for any cash-generating units within the Group’s continuing operations in 
the current year. Refer to note 7 for cash-generating units recognised as 'Discontinued operations and assets held for sale' in the current year. 
The Group recognised a reversal of the prior year impairment of €64 million in the consolidated income statement within operating profit relating to 
our investment in Indus Towers. Further detail on events that led to the recognition of this reversal is included on page 155.

4. Impairment losses (continued)  
Key assumptions used in the value in use calculations 
The key assumptions used in determining the value in use are: 
Assumption 
How determined 
Projected adjusted 
EBITDAaL 
Projected adjusted EBITDAaL has been based on past experience adjusted for the following: 
- In Europe, mobile revenue is expected to benefit from increased usage as customers transition to higher data 
bundles, and new consumer and business products and services are introduced. Fixed revenue is forecast to 
grow as penetration is increased and more products and services are sold to customers; 
- Outside of Europe, revenue is expected to continue to grow as the penetration of faster data-enabled devices 
rises along with higher data bundle attachment rates, and new products and services are introduced; and 
- Margins are expected to be impacted by negative factors such as the cost of acquiring and retaining customers 
in increasingly competitive markets and by positive factors such as the efficiencies expected from the 
implementation of Group initiatives. 
Projected capital 
expenditure 
The cash flow forecasts for capital expenditure are based on past experience and include the ongoing capital 
expenditure required to maintain our networks, provide products and services in line with customer expectations, 
including of higher data volumes and speeds, and to meet the population coverage requirements of certain of the 
Group’s licences. In Europe, capital expenditure is required to roll out capacity-building next generation 5G and 
gigabit networks. Outside of Europe, capital expenditure will be required for the continued rollout of current and 
next generation mobile networks in emerging markets. Capital expenditure includes cash outflows for the 
purchase of owned property, plant and equipment and computer software. 
Projected licence and 
spectrum payments 
To enable the continued provision of products and services, the cash flow forecasts for licence and spectrum 
payments for each relevant cash-generating unit include amounts for expected renewals and newly available 
spectrum. Beyond the five year forecast period, a long-run cost of spectrum is assumed. 
Long-term growth rate 
For the purposes of the Group’s value in use calculations, a long‑term growth rate into perpetuity is applied 
immediately at the end of the five year forecast period and is based on the lower of: 
- the nominal GDP growth rate forecasts for the country of operation; and 
- the long-term compound annual growth rate in adjusted EBITDAaL as estimated by management. 
Long-term compound annual growth rates determined by management may be lower than forecast nominal GDP 
growth rates due to the following market-specific factors: competitive intensity levels, maturity of business, 
regulatory environment or sector-specific inflation expectations. 
Pre-tax discount rate 
The pre-tax discount rate for each cash-generating unit is derived such that when applied to pre-tax cash flows it 
gives the same result as when the observable post-tax weighted average cost of capital is applied to post-tax cash 
flows.   
The assumptions used to develop discount rates for each cash-generating unit are benchmarked to externally 
available data.  
- The risk free rate is derived from an average yield of a ten year bond issued by the government in each cash-
generating unit’s respective country of operations; 
- The forward-looking equity market risk premium (an investor’s required rate of return over and above a risk free 
rate) is based on studies by independent economists, the long-term average equity market risk premium and 
the market risk premiums typically used by valuation practitioners; 
- The asset beta reflecting the systematic risk of the telecommunications segment relative to the market as a 
whole is determined from betas observed for comparable listed telecommunications companies; and 
- The region-specific leverage ratios are estimated from ratios observed for comparable listed 
telecommunications companies. 
Each cash-generating unit’s discount rate is determined in nominal terms in order to match their nominal 
estimates of future cash flows.  
Higher risk free interest rates and lower asset betas have, respectively, increased and decreased the cash-
generating unit discount rates in the current year.

Year ended 31 March 2024 
The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at 31 March and when there is an indicator of 
impairment of an asset. At each reporting period date, judgement is exercised by management in determining whether any internal or external 
sources of information observed are indicative that the carrying amount of any of the Group’s cash generating units is not recoverable. Refer to note 
7 for cash-generating units recognised as 'Discontinued operations and assets held for sale' in the current year. 
Climate change 
As a large owner of infrastructure and consumer of energy, the Group has exposure to climate change related risks such as energy cost increases, 
asset damage and service disruption. The long range plans used in the Group’s impairment testing include forecast energy costs and other costs 
that are embedded in the planning process to deliver the Group’s zero carbon targets. The long range plans also include capital expenditure in 
relation to the Group’s use of durable and energy efficient infrastructure and the costs of the Group’s extensive and ongoing network maintenance 
programme. Climate change has not had a material impact on the outcome of the Group’s impairment testing. 
Indus Towers Limited 
Management determines the recoverable amount of the Group’s investment in Indus Towers on a fair value less costs to sell basis. Indus Towers’ 
share price is observable in a quoted market and is considered a level 1 input under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. The share price of INR 291.15 
per share implied a recoverable amount of INR 165 billion (€1.8 billion), which exceeds the carrying value of the Group’s investment at the same 
date. The increase in recoverable amount supports the reversal of the prior year impairment of €64 million. 
Value in use assumptions 
The table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculation for Germany as its carrying amount of goodwill is significant in 
comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill:

Year ended 31 March 2023 
The disclosures below for the year ended 31 March 2023 are as previously disclosed in the 31 March 2023 Annual Report.  
The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at 31 March and when there is an indicator of 
impairment of an asset. At each reporting period date judgement is exercised by management in determining whether any internal or external 
sources of information observed are indicative that the carrying amount of any of the Group’s cash generating units is not recoverable.  
Climate change 
As a large owner of infrastructure and consumer of energy, the Group has exposure to climate change related risks such as energy cost increases, 
asset damage and service disruption. The long range plans used in the Group’s impairment testing include forecast energy costs and other costs 
that are embedded in the planning process to deliver the Group’s zero carbon targets. The long range plans also include capital expenditure in 
relation to the Group’s use of durable and energy efficient infrastructure and the costs of the Group’s extensive and ongoing network maintenance 
programme. Climate change has not had a material impact on the outcome of the Group’s impairment testing. 
Indus Towers Limited 
The Group’s investment in Indus Towers was tested for impairment at 31 March 2023 following a decline in Indus Towers’ quoted share price in the 
current year. Management concluded that fair value less costs to sell is the appropriate basis to determine the recoverable amount of the Group’s 
investment. Indus Towers’ share price is observable in a quoted market and is considered a level 1 input under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy. The 
share price of INR 143.00 per share implied a recoverable amount of INR 81 billion (€0.9 billion) which was lower than the carrying value of the 
investment at the same date. An impairment charge of €64 million was recognised to reduce the carrying value of the Group’s investment to the 
recoverable amount in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. 
Value in use assumptions 
The table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations, and separately presented cash-generating units for which the carrying

Year ended 31 March 2022 
The disclosures below for the year ended 31 March 2022 are as previously disclosed in the 31 March 2022 Annual Report.  
The Group performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at 31 March and when there is an indicator of 
impairment of an asset. At each reporting period date judgement is exercised by management in determining whether any internal or external 
sources of information observed are indicative that the carrying amount of any of the Group’s cash-generating units is not recoverable.  
As a large owner of infrastructure and consumer of energy, the Group has exposure to climate change related risks such as energy cost increases, 
asset damage and service disruption. The long range plans used in the Group’s impairment testing include forecast energy costs and other costs 
that are embedded in the planning process to deliver the Group’s zero carbon targets. The long range plans also include capital expenditure in 
relation to the Group’s use of durable and energy efficient infrastructure and the costs of the Group’s extensive and ongoing network maintenance 
programme. Furthermore, the Group will continue to develop strong reactive initiatives to manage the unpredictable impacts of future climate-
related risks. Climate change, therefore, has not had a material impact on the outcome of the Group’s impairment testing and the Group will 
continue to refine its approach to modelling climate-related risks and opportunities in the value in use calculations.  
As the war in Ukraine continues, it is challenging to predict the full extent and duration of its impact on the economy and the Group’s businesses. 
However, to assess a potential impact of this on the Group’s impairment testing, management prepared scenario analysis based on adjustments to 
the long range plans for high level estimates of market risks impacted by the war. This analysis did not indicate a risk of impairment at 31 March 
2022. Management will update the cash flows and assumptions used in the Group’s impairment testing at future reporting dates with latest best 
estimates. 
No impairments were recognised for the Group’s cash-generating units during the year to 31 March 2022.  
Value in use assumptions 
The table below shows key assumptions used in the value in use calculations, and separately presented cash-generating units for which the carrying 
amount of goodwill is significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill:

Sensitivity analysis 
The estimated recoverable amounts of the Group’s operations in Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain exceed their carrying values by €7.3 billion, €0.4 
billion, €1.3 billion and €0.1 billion respectively. However, if the assumptions used in the impairment review were changed to a greater extent than

4. Impairment losses (continued)  
For the Group’s operations in Germany, Italy, the UK and Spain management has considered the following reasonably possible changes in pre-tax 
discount rate, long-term growth rate and projected adjusted EBITDAaL CAGR1 assumptions, leaving all other assumptions unchanged. The 
sensitivity analysis presented is prepared on the basis that the reasonably possible change in each key assumption would not have a consequential 
impact on other assumptions used in the impairment review. The associated impact on the impairment assessment is presented in the table below.   
Management has concluded that no reasonably possible or foreseeable change in projected capital expenditure2 would cause the difference 
between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash generating unit to be materially different to the base case disclosed below.

6. Taxation 
This note explains how our Group tax charge arises. The deferred tax section of the note also provides information on 
our expected future tax charges and sets out the tax assets held across the Group together with our view on whether or 
not we expect to be able to make use of these in the future.  
Accounting policies 
Income tax expense represents the sum of current and deferred taxes. 
Current tax payable or recoverable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income 
statement because some items of income or expense are taxable or deductible in different years or may never be taxable or deductible. The Group’s 
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date. 
The Group recognises provisions for uncertain tax positions when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and management 
judge that it is probable that there will be a future outflow of economic benefits from the Group to settle the obligation. Uncertain tax positions are 
assessed and measured on an issue by issue basis within the jurisdictions that we operate either using management’s estimate of the most likely 
outcome where the issues are binary, or the expected value approach where the issues have a range of possible outcomes. The Group recognises 
interest on late paid taxes as part of financing costs, and, if applicable, classifies tax penalties as part of the income tax expense if the penalties are 
based on profits.   
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in the future arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using 
the statement of financial position liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that temporary differences or taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference, or net temporary difference in a transaction that gives rise to both taxable 
and deductible temporary differences, arising from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a 
transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised to the extent they arise from 
the initial recognition of non-tax deductible goodwill. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint 
arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period date and adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s assessment that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all of the recognised asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date. 
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they 
either relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities which intend to 
settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 
Tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly 
to equity, in which case the tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity.

6. Taxation (continued)  
Factors affecting the tax charge in future years 
The Group’s future tax charge, and effective tax rate, could be affected by several factors including tax reform in countries around the world, 
including any arising from the OECD’s or European Commission’s work on the taxation of the digital economy and European Commission initiatives 
such as the Minimum Tax directive, Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation ‘BEFIT’ or as a consequence of state aid investigations, 
future corporate acquisitions and disposals, any restructuring of our businesses and the resolution of open tax issues (see below). 
The Group is routinely subject to audit by tax authorities in the territories in which it operates. The Group considers each issue on its merits and, 
where appropriate, holds provisions in respect of the potential tax liability that may arise.  As at 31 March 2024, the Group holds provisions for such 
potential liabilities of €445 million (2023: €412 million). These provisions relate to multiple issues across the jurisdictions in which the Group 
operates.  
As the tax impact of a transaction can be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process, the 
amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the Group's overall profitability and cash flows in 
future periods.  See note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
The tables below present the gross amount and expiry dates of losses available for carry forward for the year ended 31 March 2024 and the 
comparative year ended 31 March 2023.

Deferred tax assets on losses in Luxembourg 
Included in the table above are losses of €67,016 million (2023: €65,232 million) that have arisen in Luxembourg companies. A deferred tax asset of 
€16,714 million (2023: €16,269 million) has been recognised in respect of these losses, as we conclude it is probable that the Luxembourg entities 
will continue to generate taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses. These tax losses principally arose from historical 
impairments, primarily following the acquisition of the Mannesmann Group in 2000. These losses also arose prior to the 2017 tax reform in 
Luxembourg and are available to carry forward indefinitely. 
Losses incurred after the 2017 tax reform in Luxembourg, expire after 17 years and can only be used after any pre-existing losses on a first-in-first-
out basis. The Luxembourg companies have €15,933 million (2023; €15,925 million) of post-2017 losses, which will fully expire in 16 years.  No 
deferred tax asset is recognised for these post-2017 losses on the basis that they are not forecast to be used prior to the expiry of their 17 year life. 
We also have €9,136 million (2023: €9,136 million) of Luxembourg losses in a former Cable & Wireless Worldwide Group company, for which no 
deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is uncertain whether these losses will be utilised. 
In the year ended 31 March 2024, the Luxembourg companies recognised an additional €1,019 million deferred tax asset relating to losses arising 
pre-2017, as a result of favourable case law during the year. The Luxembourg companies utilised €2,393 million of their pre-2017 losses in the 
current year, representing €598 million of the deferred tax asset and 3.6% of the recognised deferred tax asset.   The recognition of the €1,019 
million additional deferred tax asset has a significant impact on reducing our total tax charge and effective tax rate for the year but is a deferred tax 
impact and has no immediate cash-tax impact. 
Following restructuring in December 2022, which saw the Luxembourg companies dispose of their investments in the Group’s non-Luxembourg 
operating companies, the profits and losses in Luxembourg are no longer expected to be significantly impacted by changes in the value of the 
Luxembourg companies’ investments. The recovery of the deferred tax asset is expected to be driven by the recurring profits of the Luxembourg 
companies. 
These recurring profits are derived from the Group’s internal financing, centralised procurement, and international roaming activities. These 
activities have consistently generated taxable profits of over €1 billion per annum throughout their existence.  The Group has reviewed the latest 
five-year forecasts for the Luxembourg companies, including their ability and the Group’s intention to continue to generate income beyond this 
period. The forecasts consider the impact of the current market conditions on the existing financing activities, including the current view of future 
interest rates, levels of intragroup financing, as well as the future profits generated from the procurement and roaming activities. 
This assessment also included a review of the commercial structures supporting the profits generated from these activities and considered the 
factors, under the Group’s control, which could impact the ability of these activities to generate taxable profits. We have assessed that the current 
structure continues to be sustainable under the tax laws substantively enacted at the reporting period date and the Group’s intentions to keep these 
activities in Luxembourg remains unchanged. 
Based on the current forecasts, €3,306 million (20%) (2023: €4,518 million) of the deferred tax asset is forecast to be used within the next 10 years, 
and €6,344 million (38%) (2023: €8,742 million) used within 20 years. The losses are projected to be fully utilised over the next 52 to 57 years 
(2023: 35 to 39 years).

The increase in the recovery period over the prior year is principally a result of lower forecast interest rates, driving margins down on existing 
financing activities, and lower internal financing income as the Group right-sizes its portfolio which includes the Group’s announcement of 
agreements to sell its operations in Spain and Italy. An increase or decrease in the forecast income in Luxembourg in each year of 5%-10% would 
change the period over which the losses will be fully utilised by 3 to 6 years either way. The Group uses different scenarios to forecast income to 
understand the impact that a change in interest rates or level of debt advanced by the Luxembourg companies could have on the recovery period of 
the losses.  
The Group does not currently recognise deferred tax assets which are forecast to be used 60 years beyond the reporting period date. 
Any future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of the Luxembourg losses, including the period 
over which these losses can be utilised. On the basis that future changes in tax laws are unknown, the profit forecasts assume that existing tax laws 
continue. 
Based on the above factors the Group concludes that it is probable that the Luxembourg companies will continue to generate taxable profits in the 
future against which it will use these losses. 
Deferred tax assets in the UK 
The Group has a recognised deferred tax asset in the UK totalling €2,485 million (2023: €1,809 million) which consists primarily of excess 
capital allowances, which can be claimed on a reducing balance basis.  The net deferred tax asset has increased in 2024, primarily due to a 
€574 million reduction in an offsetting deferred tax liability in relation to mark-to-market movements on cash-flow hedging in Vodafone 
Group Plc. The UK tax group consists of the UK operating company along with Common Functions and Group Treasury. The Group has 
reviewed the latest forecasts for the UK business which incorporate the inherent risks of operating in the telecommunications business. In the 
period beyond the 5-year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for 
the UK business we believe there should be sufficient taxable profits to utilise 90% of the deferred tax asset balance within 18 years, and 99% 
within 27 years. 
The Group has losses amounting to €29,713 million (2023: €2,377 million) in respect of UK subsidiaries which are only available for offset against 
future capital gains and, due to the UK Substantial Shareholding Exemption rules, we do not believe it is probable we will utilise these losses such 
that no deferred tax asset has been recognised, as in the prior year.  
The amount of capital losses grew significantly in 2024 as a result of the strike-off of a number of entities. The entities struck-off consisted of certain 
holding companies involved in historical M&A activities, such as Vodafone’s acquisition of the Mannesmann Group in 2000.  The remaining losses 
relate to a number of other jurisdictions across the Group. There are also €2,941 million (2023: €2,443 million) of unrecognised temporary 
differences relating to treasury and other items. 
Deferred tax assets on losses in Germany 
The Group has a recognised deferred tax assets of €2,029 million (2023: €2,021 million) in Germany in respect of losses arising primarily on the write 
down of investments in Germany in 2000. The losses relate to German corporate tax and trade tax liabilities and they do not expire. The Group 
concluded it is probable that the German business will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future against which we can utilise these losses.  The 
Group has reviewed the latest five -year forecasts for the German business, and the inherent risks of operating in the telecommunications business. 
In the period beyond the 5-year forecast, the Group has also specifically taken into consideration the implications of the Growth Opportunities Act, 
substantively enacted in March 2024, which introduces new interest restriction rules applying to both corporate and trade tax, but also an increase 
in permitted loss utilisation against corporate tax.  In combination, these two changes will increase taxable profits against accounting profits and 
increase loss utilisation. We expect to fully utilise the trade tax losses within 5-6 years, and corporate tax losses within 12-13 years. 
Deferred tax assets in Italy 
The Group has a deferred tax asset of €462 million (2023: €425 million), including €295 million (2023: €152 million) relating to tax losses in Italy, 
which is recognised as part of the held for sale assets and the value at the completion date will transfer with the business. 
In assessing the recognition position for Italy, the Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for the Italian business which incorporate the 
unsystematic risks of operating in the telecommunications business. In the period beyond the 5-year forecast we have reviewed the profits inherent 
in the terminal period and based on these and our expectations for the Italian business we believe it is probable the Italian losses will be fully utilised. 
Deferred tax assets in Spain 
The Group recognises deferred tax assets in Spain up to the extent of deferred tax liabilities, with gross unrecognised losses of €5,504 million (2023: 
€5,130 million). The net €3 million deferred tax liability is recognised as part of the held for sale assets and the value (along with the amount of 
unrecognised losses) at the completion date will transfer with the business.  
Impact of climate risks 
The recovery of the Group’s deferred tax assets is dependent on its forecasts of future profitability and the climate related risks have been 
considered in the Group’s assessment of the recovery of those assets (see note 4 ‘Impairment losses’). The Group does not expect the climate 
related risks to have an impact on the ability of Luxembourg to continue to provide the internal financing, procurement, and roaming activities to 
other members of the Group. 
Unremitted earnings 
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further €38,380 million (2023: €26,371 million) of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries 
because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in 
the foreseeable future.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings.

6. Taxation (continued)  
Pillar Two - Global Minimum Tax  
On 20 June 2023, the UK substantively enacted the Pillar Two global minimum tax model rules (the “Pillar Two” rules) of the OECD’s Inclusive 
Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (’BEPS’). The legislation took effect for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2024, 
making it effective for the Vodafone Group from 1 April 2024.  Under these rules, a top-up tax will arise where the effective tax rate of the Group’s 
operations in any individual jurisdiction, calculated using principles set out in the Pillar Two legislation, is below 15%. Any resulting tax would be 
payable by Vodafone Group Plc to the UK tax authority (HMRC) being the Group’s ultimate parent. 
As a consequence of the Pillar Two rules, many national governments have enacted (or announced the imminent introduction of) domestic 
minimum tax rules that are closely aligned to the OECD’s Pillar Two model rules. Where such domestic minimum tax rules are in place, they should 
raise local tax obligations to the 15% minimum rate, thereby eliminating the top-up tax liability otherwise payable by Vodafone Group Plc under the 
UK’s Pillar Two rules. Vodafone monitors the implementation of such domestic minimum tax rules to ensure compliance with all filing obligations. 
We have performed an assessment of the Group’s potential exposure to Pillar Two rules based on financial information for the years ended 31 March 
2023 and 31 March 2024 and simulated the transitional Safe harbour tests set out by the OECD based on our Country-by-Country reporting data 
and our consolidated financial statements for 2021, 2022, 2023. 
According to this assessment, Vodafone should meet one or more Safe harbour tests in the majority of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  The 
Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above 15%.  We estimate that the combined impact of 
countries implementing qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes and the income inclusion rule in the UK will result in an estimated €9-14 million 
additional tax per annum, which will not have a significant impact on the Group's Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (‘AETR’). 
7. Discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
The Group classifies certain of its assets that it expects to dispose as either discontinued operations or as held for sale.     
The Group classifies non-current assets and assets and liabilities within disposal groups (‘assets’) as held for sale if the assets are available 
immediately for sale in their present condition, management is committed to a plan to sell the assets under usual terms, it is highly probable that 
their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and the sale is expected to be 
completed within one year from the date of the initial classification.  
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated statement of financial position and are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not 
depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. Similarly, equity accounting ceases for associates and joint ventures held for sale.   
Where operations constitute a separately reportable segment (see note 2 ‘Revenue disaggregation and segmental analysis’) and have been 
disposed of, or are classified as held for sale, the Group classifies such operations as discontinued.  
Discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from 
discontinued operations in the Consolidated income statement. Discontinued operations are also excluded from segment reporting. All other notes 
to the Consolidated financial statements include amounts for continuing operations, unless indicated otherwise.  
Transactions between the Group's continuing and discontinued operations are eliminated in full in the Consolidated income statement. To the 
extent that the Group considers that the commercial relationships with discontinued operations will continue post-disposal, transactions are 
reflected within continuing operations with an opposite charge or credit reflected within the results of discontinued operations resulting in a net nil 
impact on the Group’s Profit for the financial year for the years presented. 
Discontinued operations 
On 31 October 2023, the Group announced that it had entered into binding agreements with Zegona Communications plc (’Zegona’) in relation to 
the sale of 100% of Vodafone Holdings Europe, S.L.U. (‘Vodafone Spain’). The expected completion of the disposal is the first half of 2024.   
On 15 March 2024, the Group announced that it had entered into a binding agreement with Swisscom AG (‘Swisscom’) in relation to the sale of 
100% of Vodafone Italia S.p.A. (’Vodafone Italy’). The expected completion of the disposal is in the first half of 2025. 
Consequently, the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are reported as discontinued operations and the assets and liabilities of both are 
presented as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position.    
A summary of the results of these discontinued operations is below.

The consideration for Vodafone Spain is comprised of €4.1 billion cash to be paid on completion and non-cash consideration with a nominal value 
of €0.9 billion.  The non-cash consideration comprises Redeemable Preference Shares (‘RPS’) which will be issued to Vodafone by a newly created 
entity, which will subscribe for new ordinary shares in Zegona for an amount, based on the issue price for Zegona's equity raise, that is equivalent to 
the amount of RPS being subscribed for by Vodafone. The RPS will be redeemed 6 years after completion, or earlier following a material liquidity 
event or exit for Zegona that releases funds to its shareholders.  A proportion of the consideration is related to future services to be provided by the 
Group to Zegona. For the year ended 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a non-cash charge of €345 million (pre and post-tax), included in 
discontinued operations, as a result of the re-measurement of Vodafone Spain to its fair value less costs to sell.  The charge mostly results from the 
non-recognition of €538 million (pre and post-tax) depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets from the date Vodafone Spain was classified 
as held for sale. 
The fair value of the Group’s equity interest at 31 March 2024 was determined with reference to the consideration expected from the agreed sale to 
Zegona less adjustments for estimated completion adjustments, consideration for future services to be received by Zegona from the Group and the 
elimination of intercompany debt. This approach was considered to result in a level 2 valuation in accordance with IFRS 13 as certain estimated 
completion adjustments and the fair value of the non-cash consideration, are not observable.

The consideration for Vodafone Italy is comprised of €8 billion cash to be paid on completion. A proportion of the consideration is related to future 
services to be provided by the Group to Swisscom. For the year ended 31 March 2024, the Group recorded a non-cash charge of €83 million (pre and 
post-tax), included in discontinued operations, as a result of the re-measurement of Vodafone Italy to its fair value less costs to sell.  The charge 
mostly results from the non-recognition of €93 million (€67 million net of tax) depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets from the date 
Vodafone Italy was classified as held for sale. 
The fair value of the Group’s equity interest at 31 March 2024 was determined with reference to the consideration expected to be received from the

10. Intangible assets  
The consolidated statement of financial position contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill 
and licences and spectrum. Goodwill, which arises when we acquire a business and pay a higher amount than the fair 
value of its net assets primarily due to the synergies we expect to create, is not amortised but is subject to annual 
impairment reviews. Licences and spectrum are amortised over the life of the licence. For further details see ‘Critical 
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation ‘ to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
Accounting policies 
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Identifiable intangible assets are recognised at fair value when the Group 
completes a business combination. The determination of the fair values of the separately identified intangibles, is based, to a considerable extent, 
on management’s judgement. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the 
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not 
subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is evidence that it may be impaired. Goodwill is denominated in the 
currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing exchange rate at each reporting period date. 
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. 
On disposal of a subsidiary or a joint arrangement, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
recognised in the consolidated income statement on disposal. 
Finite lived intangible assets 
Intangible assets with finite lives are stated at acquisition or development cost, less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period and method 
is reviewed at least annually. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in 
the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. 
Licence and spectrum fees 
Amortisation periods for licence and spectrum fees are determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period, the conditions for licence 
renewal and whether licences are dependent on specific technologies. Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives from the commencement of related network services. 
Software 
Computer software comprises software purchased from third parties as well as the cost of internally developed software. Computer software 
licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software. Costs that are directly associated with 
the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and are probable of producing future economic benefits, are 
recognised as intangible assets. Direct costs of software development include employee costs and directly attributable overheads. 
Software integral to an item of hardware equipment is classified as property, plant and equipment.  
Costs associated with maintaining software programs are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.  
Amortisation is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life from the date the software is 
available for use. 
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets, including brands and customer bases, are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortisation is charged to the 
consolidated income statement, over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, on a straight-line basis. 
The amortisation basis adopted for each class of intangible asset reflects the Group’s consumption of the economic benefit from that asset.  
Estimated useful lives 
The estimated useful lives of finite lived intangible assets are as follows: 
Licence and spectrum fees 
3 - 40 years 
Software 
3 - 10 years 
Brands 
1 - 30 years 
Customer bases 
2 - 37 years

11. Property, plant and equipment  
The Group makes significant investments in network equipment and infrastructure – the base stations and technology 
required to operate our networks – that form the majority of our tangible assets. All assets are depreciated over their 
useful economic lives. For further details on the estimation of useful economic lives, see ‘Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation ‘to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
Accounting policies 
Land and buildings held for use are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at their cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
any accumulated impairment losses. 
Amounts for equipment, fixtures and fittings, which includes network infrastructure assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. 
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment losses. Depreciation of these assets commences when the 
assets are ready for their intended use. 
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, as 
follows: 
Land and buildings 
Freehold buildings 
25 - 50 years 
Leasehold premises 
the term of the lease 
Equipment, fixtures and fittings 
Network infrastructure and other 
1 - 35 years 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land. 
Right-of-use assets arising from the Group’s lease arrangements are depreciated over their reasonably certain lease term, as determined under the 
Group’s leases policy (see note 20 ‘Leases’ and ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of 
preparation’ for details).  
The gain or loss arising on the disposal, retirement or granting of a finance lease on an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the 
difference between any proceeds from sale or receivables arising on a lease and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.

12. Investments in associates and joint arrangements 
The Group holds interests in associates in Kenya and in India, where we have significant influence, as well as in a 
number of joint arrangements, notably in the Netherlands, India, Australia and Oak Holdings 1 GmbH and its markets, 
where we share control with one or more third parties. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key 
sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
Accounting policies 
Interests in joint arrangements 
A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint 
control; that is, when the relevant activities that significantly affect the investee’s returns require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing 
control. Joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures.  
Gains or losses resulting from the contribution or sale of a subsidiary as part of the formation of a joint arrangement are recognised in respect of 
the Group’s entire equity holding in the subsidiary. 
Joint operations 
A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, 
relating to the arrangement or that other facts and circumstances indicate that this is the case. The Group’s share of assets, liabilities, revenue, 
expenses and cash flows are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.  
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Group’s interest in a joint operation is accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy 
for goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary. 
Joint ventures 
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have the rights to the net assets of the arrangement.  
At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the joint venture is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.  
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures, other than those joint ventures or part thereof that are held for sale (see note 7 ‘Discontinued 
operations and assets held for sale’), are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the 
equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost adjusted for post-acquisition 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment. The Group’s share of post-tax 
profits or losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest in that joint venture 
are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. 
Associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement.  
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but where the Group does not have 
control or joint control over those policies.  
At the date of acquisition, any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the associate is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment.  
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the same equity method of 
accounting used for joint ventures, described above.  
Joint operations 
In the prior year, on 22 March 2023, the Group completed the disposal of its principal joint operation (Cornerstone Telecommunications 
Infrastructure Limited) as part of the transaction with Oak Holdings 1 GmbH.

OXG Glasfaser Beteiligungs GmbH 
In March 2023, the Group entered into an agreement with Altice Luxembourg S.A. to create a joint venture, OXG Glasfaser Beteiligungs GmbH 
(‘OXG’), with 50.0% shareholding held by each shareholder. Each shareholder is committed to contribute funding of up to €950 million to OXG for 
the deployment of fibre-to-the-home in Germany.  During the year ended 31 March 2024, the Group provided €32 million of capital contributions to 
OXG. The remaining funding commitment of €918 million is expected to be contributed between 2024 and 2029. The amount and timing of the 
funding depends on the speed and size of the fibre deployment. The contribution can be in the form of free capital reserves, shareholder loan, loan 
notes or similar instruments as agreed by the shareholders. 
Vodafone Idea Limited 
The Group’s carrying value in Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) reduced to €nil at 30 September 2019. The Group’s share of VIL’s losses not recognised 
at 31 March 2024 is €4,528 million (2023: €3,717 million). Vodafone Idea Limited has undertaken equity fund-raisings totalling €2.2 billion since 31 
March 2024, reducing the Group’s shareholding to 23.2% 
The value of the Group’s 21.0% shareholding in Indus Towers Limited is, in part, dependent on the income generated by Indus Towers Limited from 
tower rentals to major customers, including VIL. Any inability of these major customers to pay such amounts in the future may impact the carrying 
value of €1,104 million at 31 March 2024 (2023: €908 million) of the Group’s investment in Indus Towers Limited. 
VIL has undertaken equity fund-raisings totalling €2.2 billion since 31 March 2024, reducing the Group’s shareholding to 23.2%.

13. Other investments 
The Group holds a number of other listed and unlisted investments, mainly comprising managed funds, 
deposits and government bonds. 
Accounting policies 
Other investments comprising debt and equity instruments are recognised and derecognised on settlement date and are initially measured 
at fair value, including transaction costs. 
Debt securities that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and 
interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment. Debt securities that do not meet the 
criteria for amortised cost are measured at fair value through profit and loss.  
Equity securities are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of 
fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.

Notes: 
1 Items measured at a fair value, €27 million (2023: €47 million) of equity securities have a valuation basis of level 1 classification, which comprises financial instruments where fair value is 
determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The remaining items are measured at fair value and the basis is level 2 classification, which 
comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
2 Items are measured at amortised cost and have a fair value of €810 million (2023: €803 million) with a valuation basis of level 2 classification. 
3 Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 1 classification. 
4 Items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying amount approximates fair value. 
5 Includes investments measured at a fair value of €459 million (2023: €1,409 million). The valuation basis is level 1. The remaining items are measured at amortised cost and the carrying 
amount approximates fair value. 
Non-current debt securities within non-current assets include €830 million (2023: €885 million) of loan notes issued by VodafoneZiggo 
Holding B.V. 
The Group invests surplus cash positions across a portfolio of short-term investments to manage liquidity and credit risk whilst achieving 
suitable returns. Collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments result in cash being paid/(held), repayable when the 
derivatives are settled. These assets do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents but are included in the Group’s net debt based 
on their liquidity. 
Bonds and debt securities includes €587 million (2023: €nil) of highly liquid French; €308 million (2023: €290 million) Dutch; €306 million 
(2023: €899 million) Japanese and €nil (2023: €150 million) German government securities.  
Managed investment funds of €2,024 million (2023: €2,967 million) are in funds with liquidity of up to 90 days. 
Collateral assets of €741 million (2023: €239 million) represents collateral paid on derivative financial instruments.   
Other investments are excluded from net debt based on their liquidity and primarily consist of restricted debt securities including amounts 
held in qualifying assets by Group insurance companies to meet regulatory requirements.

14. Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables mainly consist of amounts owed to us by customers and amounts that we pay to our 
suppliers in advance. Derivative financial instruments with a positive market value are reported within this note as are 
contract assets, which represent an asset for accrued revenue in respect of goods or services delivered to customers for 
which a trade receivable does not yet exist, and finance lease receivables recognised where the Group acts as a lessor. 
See note 20 ‘Leases’ for more information on the Group’s leasing activities. 
Accounting policies 
Trade receivables represent amounts owed by customers where the right to receive payment is conditional only on the passage of time. Trade 
receivables that are recovered in instalments from customers over an extended period are discounted at market rates and interest revenue is 
accreted over the expected repayment period. Other trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value. When the 
Group establishes a practice of selling portfolios of receivables from time to time these portfolios are recorded at fair value through other 
comprehensive income; all other trade receivables are recorded at amortised cost. 
The carrying value of all trade receivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables recorded at amortised cost is reduced by allowances for 
lifetime estimated credit losses. Estimated future credit losses are first recorded on the initial recognition of a receivable and are based on the 
ageing of the receivable balances, historical experience and forward looking considerations. Individual balances are written off when management 
deems them not to be collectible.

Note: 
1 Includes €22 million (2023: €198 million) of embedded derivative option for which fair value is based on level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see section on fair value carrying value information 
within note 22 ‘Capital and Risk Management’). All other items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined 
from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
The Group’s trade receivables and contract assets are classified at amortised cost unless stated otherwise and are measured after allowances for 
future expected credit losses, see note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’ for more information on credit risk.  
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, which are measured at amortised cost, approximate their fair value and are predominantly 
non-interest bearing.  
The Group’s contract-related costs comprise €1,814 million (2023: €2,078 million) relating to costs incurred to obtain customer contracts and €31 
million (2023: €83 million) relating to costs incurred to fulfil customer contracts; an amortisation and impairment expense, excluding discontinued 
operations in Spain and Italy, of €853 million (2023: €824 million) was recognised in operating profit during the year. 
Other than for the embedded derivative option described above, the fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting 
the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.

amounts. See note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ for more information.  
2. Items are measured at fair value and the valuation basis is level 2 classification, which comprises items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
The carrying amounts of trade and other payables approximate their fair value. 
Materially all of the €2,043 million recorded as current contract liabilities at 1 April 2023 was recognised as revenue during the year with the 
exception of Vodacom Italy and Vodafone Spain whose revenue of €299 million will be reported as part of the discontinued operation. See note 7 
‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more information. 
Insurance liabilities included within non-current liabilities include €254 million (2023: €257 million) in respect of the re-insurance of a third party 
annuity policy related to the Vodafone and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme. 
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market interest rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
16. Provisions 
A provision is a liability recorded in the Consolidated statement of financial position, where there is uncertainty over the 
timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore often estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to asset 
retirement obligations, which include the cost of returning network infrastructure sites to their original condition at the 
end of the lease and claims for legal and regulatory matters.  
Accounting policies 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material. Where 
the timing of settlement is uncertain amounts are classified as non-current where settlement is expected more than 12 months from the reporting date. 
Asset retirement obligations 
In the course of the Group’s activities, a number of sites and other assets are utilised which are expected to have costs associated with decommissioning. 
The associated cash outflows are substantially expected to occur at the dates of decommissioning of the assets to which they relate, and are long term in 
nature. 
Legal and regulatory 
The Group is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including where the Group has received notifications of possible claims. The 
Directors of the Company, after taking legal advice, have established provisions considering the facts of each case. For a discussion of 
certain legal issues potentially affecting the Group see note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial 
statements. 
Restructuring 
The Group undertakes periodic reviews of its operations and recognises provisions as required based on the outcomes of these 
reviews. The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are primarily less than one year. 
Other  
Comprises various items that do not fall within the Group’s other categories of provisions.

19. Cash and cash equivalents 
The majority of the Group’s cash is held in bank deposits or money market funds which have a maturity of three months 
or less from acquisition to enable us to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.  
Accounting policies 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Assets in money market funds, whose contractual cash flows do not 
represent solely payments of interest and principal, are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in net 
profit or loss for the period. All other cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.

Cash and cash equivalents of €1,629 million (2023: €1,572 million) are held in countries with restrictions on remittances but where the balances 
could be used to repay subsidiaries’ third party liabilities. In addition, those balances could also be used to repay €790 million (2023: €722 million) 
of intercompany liabilities as at 31 March 2024.

20. Leases 
The Group leases assets from other parties (the Group is a lessee) and also leases assets to other parties (the Group is a 
lessor).  This note describes how the Group accounts for leases and provides details about its lease arrangements. 
Accounting policies 
As a lessee 
When the Group leases an asset, a ‘right-of-use asset’ is recognised for the leased item and a lease liability is recognised for any lease payments to 
be paid over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the present value of the 
lease payments paid or payable, plus any initial direct costs incurred in entering the lease and less any lease incentives received.  
Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the asset’s useful life or the 
end of the lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any periods for which the Group is ‘reasonably certain’ to 
exercise any extension options (see below). The useful life of the asset is determined in a manner consistent to that for owned property, plant and 
equipment (as described in note 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’). If right-of-use assets are considered to be impaired, the carrying value is 
reduced accordingly.  
Lease liabilities are initially measured at the value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at the commencement date and are 
usually discounted using the incremental borrowing rates of the applicable Group entity (the rate implicit in the lease is used if it is readily 
determinable). Lease payments included in the lease liability include both fixed payments and in-substance fixed payments during the term of the 
lease.  
After initial recognition, the lease liability is recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change 
in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate (e.g. an inflation related increase) or if the Group’s assessment of the lease term 
changes; any changes in the lease liability as a result of these changes also results in a corresponding change in the recorded right-of-use asset 
unless the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero in which case the remaining amount of the remeasurement is recognised in profit or loss.    
Lease modifications that increase the scope of a lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets in return for consideration 
commensurate with the stand-alone price for the additional lease components are treated as separate leases.  If a lease modification decreases the 
scope of the lease, the Group remeasures both the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and recognises any gain or loss in profit or loss. Other 
lease modifications result in a remeasurement of the lease liability with an adjustment to the right-of-use asset.  Remeasured lease liabilities are 
discounted at the modification date using a current discount rate. 
As a lessor 
Where the Group is a lessor, it determines at inception whether the lease is a finance or an operating lease. When a lease transfers substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise the lease is an operating lease.  
Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the interests in the head lease and the sublease are accounted for separately and the lease classification 
of a sublease is determined by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.  
Income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Income from finance leases is recognised at lease 
commencement with any interest income recognised over the lease term.  
Lease income is recognised as revenue for transactions that are part of the Group’s ordinary activities (i.e. primarily leases of handsets or other 
equipment to customers, leases of wholesale access to the Group’s fibre and cable networks and leases of tower infrastructure assets). The Group 
uses IFRS 15 principles to allocate the consideration in contracts between any lease and non-lease components.  
The Group’s leasing activities as a lessee 
The Group leases buildings for its retail stores, offices and data centres, land on which to construct mobile base stations, space on mobile base 
stations to place active RAN equipment and network space (primarily rack space or duct space). In addition, the Group leases fibre and other fixed 
connectivity to provide internal connectivity for the Group’s operations and on a wholesale basis from other operators to provide fixed connectivity 
services to the Group’s customers.  
The Group’s general approach to determining lease term by class of asset is described in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ under ‘Critical accounting 
judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’.  
Most of the Group’s leases include future price increases through fixed percentage increases, indexation to inflation measures on a periodic basis or 
rent review clauses. Other than fixed percentage increases the lease liability does not reflect the impact of these future increases unless the 
measurement date has passed. The Group’s leases contain no material variable payments clauses other than those related to the number of 
operators sharing space on third party mobile base stations.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
20. Leases (continued)  
Optional lease periods 
Where practicable the Group seeks to include extension or break options in leases to provide operational flexibility, therefore many of the Group’s 
lease contracts contain optional periods. The Group’s policy on assessing and reassessing whether it is reasonably certain that the optional period 
will be included in the lease term is described in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ under ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty’.  
After initial recognition of a lease, the Group only reassesses the lease term when there is a significant event or a significant change in 
circumstances, which was not anticipated at the time of the previous assessment. Significant events or significant changes in circumstances could 
include merger and acquisition or similar activity, significant expenditure on the leased asset not anticipated in the previous assessment, or detailed 
management plans indicating a different conclusion on optional periods to the previous assessment. Where a significant event or significant change 
in circumstances does not occur, the lease term and therefore lease liability and right-of-use asset value, will decline over time.  
The Group’s cash outflow for leases in the year ended 31 March 2024 was €3,567 million (2023 re-presented1: €3,067 million, 2022 re-presented1: 
€3,018 million) and absent significant future changes in the volume of the Group’s activities or other strategic or structural changes to the Group 
resulting in the use of more or fewer owned assets, this level of cash outflow from leases would be expected to continue for future periods, subject 
to contractual price increases. The future cash outflows included within lease liabilities are shown in the maturity analysis below. The maturity 
analysis only includes the reasonably certain payments to be made; cash outflows in these future periods will likely exceed these amounts as 
payments will be made on optional periods not considered reasonably certain at present and on new leases entered into in future periods. 
The Group’s leases for customer connectivity are normally either under regulated access or network sharing or similar preferential access 
arrangements and as a result the Group normally has significant flexibility over the term it can lease such connections for; generally the notice 
period required to cancel the lease is less than the notice period included in the service contract with the end customer.  As a result, the Group does 
not have any significant cash exposure to optional periods on customer connectivity as the Group can cancel the lease when the service agreement 
ends. In some circumstances the Group is committed to minimum spend amounts for connectivity leases, which are included within reported lease 
liabilities.  
Sale and leaseback 
In the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group disposed of its interest in Vantage Towers A.G. (‘Vantage Towers’) into a new joint venture, Oak Holdings 
1 GmbH (‘Oak’); Vodafone retained an interest of 64.2% in Oak, which owns 89.3% of Vantage Towers (see note 27 ‘Acquisitions and disposals’ for 
additional details). The Group has agreements with Vantage Towers to lease back spaces on its towers (see note 30 ‘Related party transactions’). The 
Group de-recognised assets related to the mobile base stations with a net book value of €4,793 million. A total net gain on disposal of €9,287 
million was realised in the year ended 31 March 2023 as a result of the disposal of Vantage Towers; €680 million of this gain, reflecting the gain on 
the proportion of sold towers retained through the leaseback, was recorded in the year ended 31 March 2023 as a reduction in the value of the 
right-of-use asset recognised for the leaseback of tower space and will be realised as a reduction in depreciation over the term of the leaseback until 
November 2028. Other sale and leaseback transactions entered into by the Group were not material, individually or in aggregate.

At 31 March 2024 the Group has committed to enter into future lease contracts with future undiscounted lease payments of €1,339 million (31 
March 2023 restated2:  €1,491 million) which includes €1,031 million (31 March 2023:  €1,171 million) of commitments to Vantage Towers A.G. for 
tower leases which are due to commence over the period until March 2026 and which will be payable during the eight year lease term following the 
commencement of respective individual leases.  
Notes: 
1 The cash outflows for the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as 
discontinued operations, decreasing the previously disclosed amounts by €1,412 million (2022: €1,320 million). See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more 
information.

Interest expense on lease liabilities for the year is disclosed in note 5 ‘Investment income and financing costs’. 
The Group has no material liabilities under residual value guarantees and makes no material variable payments not included in the lease liability. 
The Group does not apply either the short term or low value expedient options in IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.      
The Group’s leasing activities as a lessor 
The Group has a wide range of lessor activities with consumer and enterprise customers, other telecommunication companies and other 
companies. With consumer and enterprise customers, the Group generates lease income from the provision of handsets, routers and other 
communications equipment. The Group provides wholesale access to the Group’s fibre and cable networks, leases out space on the Group’s owned 
mobile base stations to other telecommunication companies and subleases certain retained mobile base station sites to telecommunication tower 
companies. In addition, the Group subleases retail stores to franchise partners in certain markets and leases out surplus assets (e.g. vacant offices 
and retail stores) to other companies. 
Lessor transactions are classified as operating or finance leases based on whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards 
incidental to ownership of the asset. Leases are individually assessed, but generally, the Group’s lessor transactions in the year are classified as: 
- 
Operating leases where the Group provides wholesale access to its fibre and cable networks, provides routers or similar equipment to fixed 
customers or is lessor of space on owned mobile base stations; and 
- 
Finance leases where the Group is sub-lessor of handsets or similar items in back-to-back arrangements or where surplus assets or certain 
retained mobile base stations sites are sublet out for all or substantially all of the remaining head lease term.

21. Borrowings 
The Group’s sources of borrowing for funding and liquidity purposes come from a range of committed bank facilities 
and through short-term and long-term issuances in the capital markets including bond and commercial paper issues 
and bank loans. Liabilities arising from the Group’s lease arrangements are also reported in borrowings; see note 20 
‘Leases’. We manage the basis on which we incur interest on debt between fixed interest rates and floating interest rates 
depending on market conditions using interest rate derivatives. The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts to 
mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements on certain monetary items. 
Accounting policies 
Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception), and are subsequently measured at 
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. Where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge relationship, fair 
value adjustments are recognised in accordance with our policy (see note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’). Any difference between the 
proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.

1 Includes €862 million (2023: €1,140 million) and €158 million (2023: €196 million) of licence and spectrum fees payable in non-current and current borrowings respectively. 
The fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities held at amortised cost approximate to fair value with the exception of long-term bonds with a 
carrying value of €39,451 million (2023: €39,512 million) which have a fair value of €35,885 million (2023: €35,044 million). Fair value is based on 
level 1 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices. 
The Group’s current borrowings also include €1,720 million (2023: €1,485 million) of bank borrowings that are secured against the Group’s 
shareholdings in Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea (see note 12 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ for further details of these assets) and 
will be repaid through the realisation of proceeds from those assets. This arrangement contains an embedded derivative option which has been 
separately fair valued and is presented within derivative assets in current assets (see note 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’). 
The Group’s borrowings, which include certain bonds that have been designated in hedge relationships, are carried at €1,229 million higher (2023: 
€1,282 million higher) than their euro equivalent redemption value. In addition, where bonds are issued in currencies other than euros, the Group 
has entered into foreign currency swaps to fix the euro cash outflows on redemption. The impact of these swaps is not reflected in borrowings and 
would decrease the euro equivalent redemption value of the bonds by €1,559 million (2023: €1,440 million).

Commercial paper programmes  
The Group currently have US and euro commercial paper programmes of US$15 billion (€13.9 billion) and €10 billion respectively which are 
available to be used to meet short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2024 both programmes remained undrawn.  
The commercial paper facilities were supported by US$4.0 billion (€3.7 billion) and €4.1 billion of syndicated committed bank facilities. No amounts 
had been drawn under these facilities. 
Bonds 
We have two €30 billion euro medium-term note programmes and a US shelf programme which are used to meet medium to long-term funding 
requirements. At 31 March 2024 the total amounts in issue under these programmes split by currency were US$19.7 billion, €15.0 billion, £4.1 
billion, AUS$0.5 billion, HKD$2.1 billion, NOK2.2 billion, CHF0.7 billion and JPY10.0 billion.  
At 31 March 2024 the Group had bonds outstanding with a nominal value equivalent to €39.5 billion. During the year ended 31 March 2024, 
bonds with a nominal value of €0.8 billion and £0.5 billion (€0.6 billion)  were issued utilising the euro medium-term note programme. 
During the year bonds with nominal value €1.6 billion and US$0.3 billion (€0.3 billion) were re-purchased and bonds with a nominal value 
€1.8 billion and US$ 1.3 billion (€1.2 billion) matured. 
Bonds mature between 2024 and 2063 (2023: 2023 and 2063) and have interest rates between 0.375% and 8% (2023: 0.375% and 7.875%). 
Mandatory convertible bonds 
In March 2023 the Group concluded the last remaining share buybacks related to its mandatory convertible bonds (‘MCBs’) issuances, for which the 
last outstanding tranche had matured during 2022. As at 31 March 2024, no further MCBs or related instruments remain outstanding. 
Treasury shares 
The Group held a maximum of 1,825,624,610 (2023: 1,825,691,429) of its own shares during the year which represented 6.3% (2023: 6.3%) of 
issued share capital at that time.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
22. Capital and financial risk management 
This note details the treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as 
the exposure and sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange risk, and the policies in place 
to monitor and manage these risks.  
Accounting policies 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Group’s consolidated statement of financial 
position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a residual interest in the 
assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies 
adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative 
financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written 
principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial 
instruments for speculative purposes. 
The Group designates certain derivatives as: 
− hedges of the change in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value hedges’); 
− hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (‘cash flow hedges’); or 
− hedges of net investments in foreign operations. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each 
reporting date. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the income 
statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship or a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations when the effective 
portion of changes in value are deferred to other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge 
relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item 
and hedging instrument. For fair value hedges, the carrying value of the hedged item is also adjusted for changes in fair value for the hedged risk, 
with gains and losses recognised in the income statement. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and 
is recognised in the income statement when the hedged transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. 
For cash flow hedges, when the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in 
the income statement. 
For net investment hedges, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the income statement when the foreign 
operation is disposed of.

The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally using a mixture of long-term and short-term capital market issues and borrowing facilities to meet 
anticipated funding requirements. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity 
to certain subsidiaries.  
Dividends from joint ventures and associates and to non-controlling shareholders 
Dividend policies within shareholder agreements for certain of the Group’s associates and joint ventures give the Group certain rights to receive 
dividends but are generally paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors or shareholders. We do not have existing obligations to pay dividends to 
non-controlling interest partners of our subsidiaries. The amount of dividends received and paid in the year are disclosed in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows. 
Sale of trade receivables  
During the year, the Group sold certain trade receivables to a number of financial institutions. Whilst there are no repurchase obligations in respect 
of these receivables, the Group provided credit guarantees which would only become payable if default rates were significantly higher than 
historical rates. The credit guarantee is not considered substantive and substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to 
the purchaser at the date of sale, therefore the receivables were derecognised. The maximum payable under the guarantees at 31 March 2024 was 
€1,929 million (2023: €1,927 million). No provision has been made in respect of these guarantees as the likelihood of a cash outflow has been 
assessed as remote. 
Supplier financing arrangements 
The Group offers suppliers the opportunity to use supply chain financing (‘SCF’). SCF allows suppliers that decide to use it to receive funding earlier 
than the invoice due date. At 31 March 2024, the financial institutions that run the SCF programmes had purchased €2.2 billion (2023: €2.4 billion) 
of outstanding supplier invoices, principally from larger suppliers. The Group does not provide any financial guarantees to the financial institutions 
under this programme and continues to cash settle supplier payables in accordance with their contractual terms. As such, the programme does not 
change the Group’s net debt, trade payable balances or cash flows. 
The Group evaluates supplier arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues to hold the characteristics of a trade 
payable or should be classified as borrowings; these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed the shorter of customary payment terms 
in the industry or 180 days. At 31 March 2024, none of the payables subject to supplier financing arrangements met the criteria to be reclassified as 
borrowings. 
Financial risk management 
The Group’s treasury function centrally manages the Group’s funding requirement, net foreign exchange exposure, interest rate management 
exposures and counterparty risk arising from investments and derivatives. Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and 
guidelines authorised and reviewed by the Board, most recently in March 2024. A treasury risk committee comprising of the Group’s Chief Financial 
Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Group Corporate Finance Director, Group Treasury Director and Group Director of Financial 
Controlling and Operations meets three times a year to review treasury activities and its members receive management information relating to 
treasury activities on a quarterly basis. The Group’s Internal Auditor reviews the internal control environment regularly.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)  
No bonds issued by the Group or the Revolving Credit Facilities are subject to financial covenant ratios. Approximately €32 billion (2023: €35 billion) 
of issued bonds have a change of control clause. The Group uses derivative instruments for currency and interest rate risk management purposes that 
are transacted by specialist treasury personnel. The Group mitigates banking sector credit risk by the use of collateral support agreements. 
The Group’s financial risk management policies seek to reduce the Group’s exposure to any future disruption to financial markets, including any 
future impacts from global economic and political uncertainty and other macro economic events. 
The Group has combined cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments of €9.4 billion, providing significant headroom over short-term 
liquidity requirements. Additionally the Group maintains undrawn revolving credit facilities of €7.8 billion euro equivalent. As at 31 March 2024 and 
after hedging, substantially all the Group’s borrowings are held on a fixed interest basis, mitigating exposure to interest rate risk. The Group has no 
significant currency exposures other than positions in economic hedging relationships. The Group’s credit risk under financing activities is spread 
across a portfolio of highly rated institutions to reduce counterparty exposures and derivative balances are substantially all collateralised. The 
Group’s operating activities result in customer credit risk, for which provisions for expected credit losses are recognised.  
Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial asset leading to a financial loss for the Group. The Group is 
exposed to credit risk from its operating activities and from its financing activities, the Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 
March to be:

associates and joint arrangements'). Financial guarantees also includes INR42.5 billion (2023: INR42.5 billion) in relation to the secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in 
Indus Towers (see note 29 'Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings').  
Expected credit loss 
The Group has financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income that are subject to the 
expected credit loss model requirements of IFRS 9. Cash and bank deposits and certain other investments are both classified and measured at 
amortised cost and subject to impairment requirements. However, the identified expected credit loss is considered to be immaterial.  
Information about expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets can be found under ‘Operating activities’ on page 195. 
Financing activities 
The Group invests in government securities on the basis they generate a fixed rate of return and are amongst the most creditworthy of investments 
available. 
Investments are made in accordance with established internal treasury policies which dictate the scaled maximum exposure permissible in relation 
to an investment’s long-term credit rating. The Group invests in AAA unsecured money market mutual funds, where the investment is limited to 
10% of each fund; A to AAA government securities, both directly and through money market mutual funds; and has two managed investment funds 
that hold securities with an average credit quality of AA. 
In respect of financial instruments used by the Group’s treasury function, the aggregate credit risk the Group may have with one counterparty is 
limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s. Furthermore, 
collateral support agreements reduce the Group’s exposure to counterparties who must post collateral when there is value due to the Group under 
outstanding derivative contracts that exceeds a contractually agreed threshold amount. When value is due to the counterparty the Group is 
required to post collateral on identical terms. Such cash collateral is adjusted daily as necessary.

In addition, as discussed in note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’, the Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of the 
trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme in respect of the funding deficit in the scheme and pledged security in relation to the Indus 
Towers merger. The Group has also pledged cash as collateral against derivative financial instruments as disclosed in note 13 ‘Other investments’. 
Operating activities 
Customer credit risk is managed by the Group’s business units which each have policies, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk 
management. Outstanding trade receivables and contract assets are regularly reviewed to monitor any changes in credit risk with concentrations of 
credit risk considered to be limited given that the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. The Group applies the simplified approach and 
records lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract assets. Expected credit losses are measured using historical cash 
collection data for periods of at least 24 months wherever possible and grouped into various customer segments based on product or customer 
type. The historical loss rates are adjusted where macroeconomic factors, for example changes in interest rates or unemployment rates, or other 
commercial factors are expected to have a significant impact when determining future expected credit loss rates. For trade receivables the expected 
credit loss provision is calculated using a provision matrix, in which the provision increases as balances age, and for receivables paid in instalments 
and contract assets a weighted loss rate is calculated to reflect the period over which the amounts become due for payment by the customer. Trade 
receivables and contract assets are written off when each business unit determines there to be no reasonable expectation of recovery and 
enforcement activity has ceased.

Notes: 
1 The results for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been re-presented to reflect that the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now reported as discontinued operations. See note 
7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for sale’ for more information. 
2 Primarily utilisation of the provision by way of write-off. 
Expected credit losses are presented as net credit losses on financial assets within operating profit and subsequent recoveries of amounts 
previously written off are credited against the same line item. 
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days and largely comprise amounts receivable from consumers and business 
customers.  The table below presents information on trade receivables past due¹ and their associated expected credit losses:

Liquidity risk 
Liquidity is reviewed daily on at least a 12 month rolling basis and stress tested on the assumption that any commercial paper outstanding matures 
and is not reissued. The Group maintains substantial cash and cash equivalents which at 31 March 2024 amounted to cash €6.2 billion (2023: €11.7 
billion) and undrawn committed facilities of €8.0 billion (2023: €8.0 billion), principally US dollar and euro revolving credit facilities of US$4.0 billion 
(€3.7 billion) and €4.1 billion and which mature in 2028 and 2029 respectively. The Group manages liquidity risk on non-current borrowings by 
maintaining a varied maturity profile with a cap on the level of debt maturity in any one calendar year, therefore minimising refinancing risk. Non-
current borrowings mature between 1 and 39 years. 
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows including interest in relation to the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities on an  
undiscounted basis which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows:

Notes: 
1 Maturities reflect contractual cash flows applicable except in the event of a change of control or event of default, upon which lenders have the right, but not the obligation, to request 
payment  within 30 days. This also applies to undrawn committed facilities. There is no debt that is subject to a material adverse change clause. Where there is a choice of contractual cash 
flow dates, principally on ‘hybrid bonds’, the expected settlement date is used. 
2    Includes spectrum licence payables with maturity profile €153 million (2023: €196 million) within one year, €187 million (2023: €170 million) in one to two years, €187 million (2023: €199 
million) in two to three years, €187 million (2023: €199 million) in three to four years, €187 million (2023: €199 million) in four to five years and €276 million (2023: €587 million) in more 
than five years. Also includes €2,628 million (2023: €4,886 million) in relation to cash received under collateral support agreements shown within 1 year. 
3 Includes financial liabilities under put option arrangements and non-derivative financial liabilities presented within trade and other payables.

Market risk 
Interest rate management 
Under the Group’s interest rate management policy, interest rates on long-term monetary assets and liabilities are principally maintained on a fixed 
rate basis. 
At 31 March 2024 and after hedging, substantially all of our outstanding liabilities are held on a fixed interest rate basis in accordance with treasury 
policy.  
For each one hundred basis point rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group had borrowings at 31 March 2024 there would be 
an increase in profit before tax by €13 million (2023: €27 million) including mark to market revaluations of interest rate and other derivatives and 
the potential interest on cash and short-term investments. There would be no material impact on equity. 
At 31 March 2024, the Group had limited exposure through interest rate derivatives and floating rate bonds referencing LIBOR and other interbank 
offered rates (IBORs).    
Foreign exchange management 
As Vodafone’s primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange its share price is quoted in sterling. Since the sterling share price represents the 
value of its future multi-currency cash flows, principally in euro, South African rand and sterling, the Group maintains the currency of debt and 
interest charges in proportion to its expected future principal cash flows and has a policy to hedge external foreign exchange risks on transactions 
denominated in other currencies above a certain de minimis level.  
At 31 March 2024 6% of net debt was denominated in currencies other than euro (4% South African rand and 2% other). This allows South African 
rand to be serviced in proportion to expected future cash flows and therefore provides a partial economic hedge against income statement 
translation exposure.  
Under the Group’s foreign exchange management policy, foreign exchange transaction exposure in Group companies is generally maintained at the 
lower of €5 million per currency per month or €15 million per currency over a six month period.  
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances treated as 
investments in foreign operations. However, there is no net impact on equity for exchange rate movements on net investment hedging instruments 
as there would be an offset in the currency translation of the foreign operation. At 31 March 2024 the Group held financial liabilities in a net 
investment hedge against the Group’s South African rand operations. Sensitivity to foreign exchange movements on the hedging liabilities, 
analysed against a strengthening of the South African rand by 10% (2023: 12%) would result in a decrease in equity of €154 million (2023: 
€267million) which would be fully offset by foreign exchange movements on the hedged net assets. In addition, cash flow hedges of principally US 
dollar borrowings would result in an increase in equity of €73 million (2023: €204 million) against a strengthening of US dollar by 3% (2023: 5%).  
The Group income statement is exposed to foreign exchange risk from both the generation of profits and losses in currencies other than euro and 
from the translation of balance sheet items not held in functional currency. 
 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange risk. The percentage movement applied to the currency is based on the 
average movements in the previous three annual reporting periods.

Equity risk 
As noted on page 201, the Group has an embedded derivative option with valuation inputs that include the quoted share prices for Indus Towers 
and Vodafone Idea. The Group’s sensitivity to a 40% increase / decrease in the combined share price input to the option valuation model would 
result in a decrease / increase in profit before tax of €19 million / €137 million (2023: €116m / €445 million). The percentage sensitivity applied is 
based on the 12month volatility of the combined share prices.  
There is no material equity risk relating to the Group’s equity investments which are detailed in note 13 ‘Other investments’.

22. Capital and financial risk management (continued)  
Risk management strategy of hedge relationships  
The risk strategies of the designated cash flow, fair value, and net investment hedges reflect the above market risk strategies.  
The objective of the cash flow hedges is principally to convert foreign currency denominated fixed rate borrowings in US dollar, pound sterling, 
Australian dollar, Swiss franc, Hong Kong dollar, Japanese yen, Norwegian krona and US dollar floating rate borrowings into euro fixed rate 
borrowings and hedge the foreign exchange spot rate and interest rate risk. There are also cash flow hedges of certain subsidiary expenditure not 
denominated in functional currency of the entity, to hedge foreign exchange spot risk. Derivative financial instruments designated in cash flow 
hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps and forwards. The swap maturity dates and liquidity profiles of the 
nominal cash flows match those of the underlying borrowings and exposures. 
The objective of the net investment hedges is to hedge foreign exchange risk in foreign operations. Derivative financial instruments designated in 
net investment hedges are cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps. The hedging instruments are rolled on an ongoing basis 
as determined by the nature of the business. 
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure 
that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. 
For hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings and investments, the Group uses a combination of cross-currency and foreign exchange 
swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk and enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the 
hedging instrument match with the terms of the hedged item. Therefore the Group expects a highly effective hedging relationship with the swap 
contracts and the value of the corresponding hedged items to change systematically in the opposite direction in response to movements in the 
underlying exchange rates and interest rates. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances 
affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses 
the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. 
Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to: 
a) The fair value of the hedging instrument on the hedge relationship designation date if the fair value is not nil; 
b) Changes in the contractual terms or timing of the payments on the hedged item; and 
c) A change in the credit risk of the Group or the counterparty with the hedging instrument. 
The hedge ratio for each designation will be established by comparing the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item 
to determine their relative weighting; for all of the Group’s existing hedge relationships the hedge ratio has been determined as 1:1. 
The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are calculated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate 
market rates and foreign currency rates prevailing at 31 March. The valuation basis is level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This classification comprises 
items where fair value is determined from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly. 
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within trade and other receivables and trade and other payables in the statement of financial 
position.

Notes: 
1     Fair value movement deferred into other comprehensive income includes €251 million loss (2023: €383 million loss) and €10 million gain (2023: €17 million gain) of foreign currency basis outside the 
cash flow and net investment hedge relationships respectively. 
2 For cash flow hedges, the movement in the hypothetical derivative (hedged item) mirrors that of the hedging instrument. Hedge ineffectiveness of the swaps designated in a cash flow hedge during the 
period was €67 million (2023: €nil). 
3     Includes euro and US dollar forward contracts against Turkish lira to hedge foreign currency forecast expenditures in local markets. Notional amounts of €166 million (2023: €259 million) and $130 million 
or €121 million equivalent (2023: $134 million or €124 million equivalent) with weighted average exchange rates of 29.68 (2023: 18.36) and 30.15 (2023: 20.07) respectively to Turkish lira. 
4    Hedge ineffectiveness of swaps designated in a net investment hedge during the period was €nil (2023: €nil). 
 
 
The carrying value of bonds includes an additional €710 million loss (2023: €776 million loss) in relation to fair value of other bonds 
previously designated in fair value hedge relationships.

Fair value and carrying value information 
The carrying value and valuation basis of the Group’s financial assets are set out in notes 13 ‘Other investments’, 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’ 
and 19 ‘Cash and cash equivalents’. For all financial assets held at amortised cost the carrying values approximate fair value except as disclosed in 
note 13 ‘Other investments’. 
The carrying value and valuation basis of the Group’s financial liabilities are set out in notes 15 ‘Trade and other payables’ and 21 ‘Borrowings’. The 
carrying values approximate fair value for the Group’s trade payables and other payables categories. For other financial liabilities a comparison of fair 
value and carrying value is disclosed in note 21 ‘Borrowings’. 
Level 3 financial instruments 
The Group’s borrowings include €1,720 million (2023: €1,485 million) of bank borrowings that are secured against the Group’s shareholdings in 
Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea (see note 12 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ for further details of these assets) and will be repaid 
through the realisation of proceeds from those assets. This arrangement contains an embedded derivative option which has been separately fair 
valued. The 31 March 2024 valuation of the embedded derivative asset of €22 million (2023: €198 million) is presented within derivative assets in 
current assets (see note 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’).  
A Black Scholes model for European put options has been used as a valuation model and primarily uses market inputs (quoted share prices and 
volatilities for Indus Towers and Vodafone Idea) along with a strike price equal to the amount payable under the loan. The valuation includes an 
unobservable adjustment to reflect the potential timeframe to settle the loan and has been modelled using a range of potential durations up to 30 
September 2025 (2023: September 2024). As a result of this unobservable adjustment, the option is classified as a level 3 instrument under the fair 
value hierarchy. An increase/(decrease) in durations applied of 6 months would increase/(decrease) the derivative asset by €31 million/(€7 million) 
(2023: €141million/(€115 million)).

Note: 
1 Excludes non-cash collateral of €370 million (2023: €nil) which is not recognised on balance sheet but which would become payable to the Group in the event of a counterparty default on 
the related derivative financial assets. 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to 
offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Derivative 
financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for offset could be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA (‘International Swaps and 
Derivatives Association’) agreements where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default from the other. 
Collateral may be offset and net settled against derivative financial instruments in the event of default by either party. The aforementioned 
collateral balances are recorded in notes 13 ‘Other investments’ or 21 ‘Borrowings’ respectively.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
25. Post employment benefits 
The Group operates a number of Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement plans for our employees. The 
Group’s largest defined benefit plan is in the UK. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources 
of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’.    
Accounting policies 
For defined benefit retirement plans, the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan liabilities is 
recognised as an asset or a liability on the consolidated statement of financial position. Defined benefit plan liabilities are assessed using the 
projected unit funding method and applying the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting period date. Assets are valued at market value. 
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for defined benefit plans or consolidated income 
statement for cash leaver plans as incurred. For this purpose, actuarial gains and losses comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial 
assumptions and experience adjustments arising from differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred. The 
return on plan assets, in excess of interest income, and costs incurred for the management of plan assets are also taken to other comprehensive 
income. 
Other movements in the net surplus or deficit are recognised in the consolidated income statement, including the current service cost, any past 
service cost and the effect of any settlements. The interest cost less the expected interest income on assets is also charged to the consolidated 
income statement. The amount charged to the consolidated income statement in respect of these plans is included within operating costs or in the 
Group’s share of the results of equity accounted operations, as appropriate. 
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the consolidated income statement as they fall due. 
Background 
At 31 March 2024 the Group operated a number of retirement plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, with varying rights and 
obligations depending on the conditions and practices in the countries concerned. The Group’s philosophy is to provide access to defined 
contribution retirement plans where feasible and to manage legacy defined benefit retirement arrangements. Defined benefit plans provide 
benefits based on the employees’ length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria. Defined contribution plans offer 
employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement. 
The Group operates defined benefit plans in Germany, India, Ireland, Italy1, the UK, the United States and defined benefit indemnity plans in Greece 
and Turkey. Defined contribution plans are currently provided in Egypt, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy1, Portugal, South Africa, Spain1 and the 
UK.

Note: 
1 The defined contribution plan results for the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 have been re-presented to reflect that the results of Vodafone Spain and Vodafone Italy are now 
reported as discontinued operations, decreasing both the previously disclosed defined contribution plans’ expense and the total amount charged to the income statement by €32 million 
and €30 million respectively. The results of the defined benefit plans have not been re-presented as such impacts are immaterial. See note 7 ‘Discontinued operations and assets held for 
sale’ for more information. 
Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s retirement policy is to provide competitive pension provision, in each operating country, in line with the market median for that 
location. The Group’s preferred retirement provision is focused on Defined Contribution arrangements and/or State provision for future service. 
The Group’s main defined benefit funding liability is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’). Since June 2014 the Vodafone 
UK plan has consisted of two segregated sections: the Vodafone Section and the Cable & Wireless Section (‘CWW Section’). Both sections are closed 
to new entrants and to future accrual. The Group also operates smaller funded and unfunded plans in the UK, funded and unfunded plans in 
Germany and a funded plan in Ireland. Defined benefit pension provision exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity 
of participants, lower than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value 
of assets of the plans.

The main defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards which are legally separate from the Group and consist of representatives who are 
employees, former employees or are independent from the Group. The trustee boards of the pension plans are required by legislation to act in the 
best interest of the participants, set the investment strategy and contribution rates and are subject to statutory funding regimes. 
The Vodafone UK plan is registered as an occupational pension plan with HM Revenue and Customs (‘HMRC’) and is subject to UK legislation and 
operates within the framework outlined by the Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension plans are funded prudently and that 
valuations are undertaken at least every three years. Separate valuations are required for the Vodafone Section and CWW Section. 
The trustees obtain regular actuarial valuations to check whether the statutory funding objective is met and whether a recovery plan is required to 
restore funding to the level of the agreed technical provisions. The 31 March 2022 triennial actuarial valuation for the Vodafone Section and CWW 
Section of the Vodafone UK plan showed a net surplus of £248 million (€290 million) on the funding basis, comprising of a £97 million (€113 
million) surplus for the Vodafone Section and a £151 million (€177 million) surplus for the CWW Section. No further contributions are due in respect 
of the Vodafone UK plan at this time.  The next actuarial valuation has an effective date of 31 March 2025.  
These plan-specific actuarial valuations differ to the IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ accounting basis, which is used to measure pension assets and 
liabilities presented in the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position. 
Funding plans are individually agreed for each of the Group’s other defined benefit plans with the respective trustees or governing board, taking into 
account local regulatory requirements. It is expected that ordinary contributions of €29 million will be paid into the Group’s defined benefit plans 
during the year ending 31 March 2025. The Group has also provided certain guarantees in respect of the Vodafone UK plan; further details are 
provided in note 29 ‘Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
The investment strategy for the UK plans is controlled by the trustees in consultation with the Group and the plans have no direct investments in 
the Group’s equity securities or in property or other assets currently used by the Group. The allocation of assets between different classes of 
investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the trustee investment policy. The trustees aim to achieve the plan’s investment objectives 
through investing partly in a diversified mix of growth assets which, over the long term, are expected to grow in value by more than the low-risk 
assets. The low-risk assets include cash and gilts, inflation and interest rate hedging and in-substance insured pensioner annuity policies in both the 
Vodafone Section and CWW Sections of the Vodafone UK plan and an insured pensioner annuity policy in the Vodafone Ireland Pension Plan. A 
number of investment managers are appointed to promote diversification by assets, organisation and investment style and current market 
conditions and trends are regularly assessed, which may lead to adjustments in the asset allocation. 
The key risks in relation to the Vodafone UK plan are set out below, alongside a summary of the steps taken to mitigate each risk. 
Risk description 
Mitigation 
Investment strategy risk 
Underperformance of the investment strategy relative to the 
changes in the Vodafone UK Plan's liabilities, which are sensitive to 
interest rates and inflation, potentially leading to shortfalls in 
meeting pension obligations.  
The plan adopts a liability driven investment framework, by investing 
in assets that aim to match the characteristics of the Vodafone UK 
Plan's liabilities. This can help to hedge the risk of future changes in 
interest rate and inflation and also reduce balance sheet volatility.  
Longevity risk 
Pensions paid by the Vodafone UK Plan are guaranteed for life, and,  
therefore, if members are expected to live longer, the liabilities 
increase. 
The Vodafone UK Plan's funding targets include a margin for 
prudence to reflect uncertainty in future life expectancy. Both 
sections of the Vodafone UK Plan have pensioner annuity policies 
which help reduce exposure to changes in longevity. Longevity risk is 
also monitored by the trustees on a regular basis through its risk 
management framework.  
Regulatory risk 
Changes in pension regulations and accounting standards can 
impact the Group's pension obligations and reporting requirements.

25. Post employment benefits (continued)  
Mortality assumptions used are based on recommendations from the individual local actuaries which include adjustments for the experience of the 
Group where appropriate. The Group’s largest plan is the Vodafone UK plan. Life expectancies assumed for the UK plans are 22.6/24.3 years (2023: 
22.8/24.7 years) for a male/female pensioner currently aged 65 years and 23.6/25.4 years (2023: 23.7/25.5 years) from age 65 for a male/female 
non-pensioner member currently aged 40.  
Charges made to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income (‘SOCI’) on the basis of the 
assumptions stated above are shown in the table below.

further net past service credits were recognised for the Vodafone UK plan relating to the offer of a pension increase exchange to all members at retirement and benefit clarifications. 
Duration of the benefit obligations 
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2024 is 15 years (2023: 16 years).

Note: 
1 Derivatives include collateral held in the form of cash. Assets are valued using ‘level 2’ inputs under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ principles and classified as unquoted accordingly. 
The fair value of plan assets, which have been measured in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, are analysed by asset category above 
and are subdivided by assets that have a quoted market price in an active market and those that do not, such as investment funds. Where available, 
the fair values are quoted prices (e.g. listed equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments without quoted prices in an active 
market (e.g. private equity) are included at values provided by the fund manager in accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are 
valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves. The Vodafone UK plan annuity policies fully match the pension obligations of those 
pensioners insured and therefore are set equal to the present value of the related obligations. Investment funds of €580 million at 31 March 2024 
(2023: €782 million) include investments in diversified alternative beta funds held in the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone UK plan. 
The actual return on plan assets over the year to 31 March 2024 was a gain of €121 million (2023: €2,290 million loss).

Sensitivity analysis 
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit retirement obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below 
shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease in the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2024.

Note: 
1 The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another. In 
presenting this sensitivity analysis, the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the same basis as prior years using the projected unit credit 
method at the end of the year, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The rate of inflation 
assumption sensitivity factors in the impact of changes to all assumptions relating to inflation including the rate of increase in salaries, pension increases and deferred revaluations. 
 
26. Share-based payments 
The Group has a number of share plans used to award shares to Executive Directors and employees as part of their 
remuneration package. A charge is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record 
the cost of these, based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. 
Accounting policies 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based awards are measured at fair value (excluding 
the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-
based award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and 
adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. A corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital is also recognised. 
Some share awards have an attached market condition, based on total shareholder return (‘TSR’), which is taken into account when calculating 
the fair value of the share awards. The valuation for the TSR is based on Vodafone’s ranking within the same group of companies, where possible, 
over the past five years. 
The fair value of awards of non-vested shares is a calculation of the closing price of the Company’s shares on the day prior to the grant date, adjusted 
for the present value of the delay in receiving dividends where appropriate. 
The maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be issued in respect of share options or share plans will not (without shareholder 
approval) exceed: 
− 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of 
ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans; and 
− 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to the date of grant, when aggregated with the total number of 
ordinary shares which have been allocated in the preceding ten year period under all plans, other than any plans which are operated  
on an all-employee basis. 
Share options 
Vodafone Sharesave Plan 
Under the Vodafone Sharesave Plan UK staff may acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to £375 over a three and/or five 
year period. The savings may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the invitation period at a discount 
of up to 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Company’s shares. 
Share plans 
Vodafone Group executive plans 
Under the Vodafone Global Incentive Plan awards of shares are granted to Directors and certain employees. The release of these shares is 
conditional upon continued employment and for some awards achievement of certain performance targets measured over a three year period.

27. Acquisitions and disposals 
The note below provides details of acquisition and disposal transactions for the current year as well as those completed in the 
prior year. For further details see ‘Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty’ in note 1 ‘Basis of 
preparation’ to the consolidated financial statements. 
Accounting policies  
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at 
the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. Acquisition-related costs are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement as incurred. The acquiree’s identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition 
date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the 
amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the 
net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the 
acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders’ proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. 
Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders 
In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.  
Disposals 
The difference between the carrying value of the net assets disposed of and the fair value of consideration received is recorded as a gain or loss on 
disposal. Foreign exchange translation gains or losses relating to subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates that the Group has disposed of, and that 
have previously been recorded in other comprehensive income or expense, are also recognised as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
Other transactions with non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries 
The aggregate cash consideration in respect of other transactions with non-controlling shareholders in subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, is as follows:

the deployment of fibre-to-the-home in Germany.  During the year ended 31 March 2024, the Group provided €32 million of capital contributions to 
OXG. The remaining funding commitment of €918 million is expected to be contributed between 2024 and 2029. The amount and timing of the 
funding depends on the speed and size of the fibre deployment. The contribution can be in the form of free capital reserves, shareholder loan, loan 
notes or similar instruments as agreed by the shareholders. 
 
29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings 
Contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payment is considered more than remote, but 
is not considered probable or cannot be measured reliably.

Notes: 
1    Performance bonds require the Group to make payments to third parties in the event that the Group does not perform what is expected of it under the terms of any related contracts or commercial 
arrangements.  
UK pension schemes 
The Group’s main defined benefit plan is the Vodafone UK Group Pension Scheme (‘Vodafone UK plan’) which has two segregated sections, the 
Vodafone Section and the CWW Section, as detailed in note 25 ‘Post employment benefits’. 
The Group has covenanted to provide security in favour of both the Vodafone Section and CWW Section when they are in a deficit position. The deficit is 
measured on a prescribed basis agreed between the Group and Trustee, which differs from the IAS 19 accounting basis or the funding basis per the 
triennial actuarial valuation reported in note 25 ‘Post employment benefits’. The Group provides surety bonds as the security. 
The level of the security has varied since inception in line with the movement in the Vodafone UK plan deficit. As at 31 March 2024 the Vodafone UK 
plan retains security over €117 million (notional value) for the Vodafone Section and no security is currently required for the CWW Section. The security 
may be substituted either on a voluntary or mandatory basis. The Company has also provided two guarantees to the Vodafone Section of the Vodafone 
UK plan for a combined value up to €1.46 billion to provide security over the deficit under certain defined circumstances, including insolvency of the 
employers. The Company has also agreed a similar guarantee of up to €1.46 billion for the CWW Section. 
An additional smaller UK defined benefit plan, the THUS Plc Group Scheme, has a guarantee from the Company for up to €117 million.

Vodafone Idea 
As part of the agreement to merge Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in 2017, the parties agreed a mechanism for payments between the Group and 
Vodafone Idea Limited (‘VIL’) pursuant to the difference between the crystallisation of certain identified contingent liabilities in relation to legal, 
regulatory, tax and other matters, and refunds relating to Vodafone India and Idea Cellular. Cash payments or cash receipts relating to these matters 
must have been made or received by VIL before any amount becomes due from or owed to the Group. Any future payments by the Group to VIL as a 
result of this agreement would only be made after satisfaction of this and other contractual conditions.   The Group’s maximum potential exposure 
under this mechanism is capped at INR 64 billion (€713 million).  
The final liability calculation date under the CLAM is 30 June 2025 and no further cash payments are considered probable from the Group as at 31 March 
2024.   
The carrying value of the Group’s investment in VIL is €nil and the Group is recording no further share of losses in respect of VIL. The Group’s potential 
exposure to liabilities within VIL is capped by the mechanism described above; consequently, contingent liabilities arising from litigation in India 
concerning the operations of Vodafone India are not reported. 
Indus Towers 
Under the terms of the Indus and Bharti Infratel merger in November 2020, a security package was agreed for the benefit of the newly created merged 
entity, Indus Towers, which could be invoked in the event that VIL was unable to make MSA payments. The remaining element of the security package is 
a secondary pledge over shares owned by Vodafone Group in Indus Towers, ranking behind Vodafone’s existing lenders for the outstanding bank 
borrowings of €1.7 billion as at 31 March 2024 secured against Indian assets (‘the bank borrowings’), with a maximum liability cap of INR 42.5 billion 
(€472 million).  In the event of non-payment of relevant MSA obligations by VIL, Indus Towers would have recourse to any secondary pledged shares, 
after repayment of the bank borrowings in full, up to the value of the liability cap.  
Legal Proceedings 
The Group is currently involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, government authorities that are 
incidental to its operations.  
Legal proceedings where the Group considers that the likelihood of material future outflows of cash or other resources is more than remote are 
disclosed below. Where the Group assesses that it is probable that the outcome of legal proceedings will result in a financial outflow, and a reliable 
estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation, a provision is recognised for these amounts.   
In all cases, determining the probability of successfully defending a claim against the Group involves the application of judgement as the outcome 
is inherently uncertain. The determination of the value of any future outflows of cash or other resources, and the timing of such outflows, involves 
the use of estimates. The costs incurred in complex legal proceedings, regardless of outcome, can be significant.  
The Group is not involved in any material proceedings in which any of the Group’s Directors, members of senior management or affiliates are either a 
party adverse to the Group or have a material interest adverse to the Group. 
Tax cases  
VISPL tax claims 
Vodafone India Services Private Limited (‘VISPL’) is involved in a number of tax cases. The total value of the claims is approximately €468 million plus 
interest, and penalties of up to 300% of the principal. 
Of the individual tax claims, the most significant is for approximately €238 million (plus interest of €672 million), which VISPL has been assessed as 
owing in respect of: (i) the sale of an international call centre by VISPL to Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited group (‘HTIL’); and 
(ii) the acquisition of and/or the alleged transfer of options held by VISPL in Vodafone India Limited. Item (i) is subject to an indemnity by HTIL. Item 
(ii), which forms the largest part of the potential claim, is not subject to any indemnity. A stay of the tax demand was obtained following a deposit of 
INR 2,000 million (€22 million) being paid, and a corporate guarantee being provided by Vodafone International Holdings BV (‘VIHBV’) for the 
balance of tax assessed. On 8 October 2015, the Bombay High Court ruled in favour of Vodafone in relation to the options and the call centre sale. 
The Indian Tax Authority has appealed to the Supreme Court of India. The appeal hearing has been adjourned indefinitely. A claim in respect of the 
transfer pricing margin charged for the international call centre of HTIL prior to the 2007 transaction with Vodafone for HTIL assets in India has now 
been settled. 
While there is some uncertainty as to the outcome of the remaining tax cases involving VISPL, the Group believes it has valid defences and does not 
consider it probable that a financial outflow will be required to settle these cases. 
Netherlands tax case 
Vodafone Europe BV (‘VEBV’) received assessments totalling €267 million of tax and interest from the Dutch tax authorities, who challenged the 
application of the arm’s length principle in relation to various intra-group financing transactions. The Group entered into a guarantee for the full 
value of the assessments issued. VEBV appealed against these assessments to the District Court of the Hague where a hearing was held in March 
2023. The District Court issued its judgement in July 2023, upholding VEBV’s appeal in relation to the majority of issues and requiring the Dutch tax 
authorities to significantly reduce its assessments. VEBV and the Dutch tax authorities have since appealed the judgement. The appeal hearing date 
is not yet known but is expected to be before the end of 2024. 
The Group continues to believe it has robust defences but has recorded a provision of €24 million for tax and interest, reflecting the Group’s current 
view of the probable financial outflow required to fully resolve the issue and has reduced the guarantee to the same value.

29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)  
Other cases in the Group 
Germany: Kabel Deutschland takeover - class actions  
The German courts have been determining the adequacy of the mandatory cash offer made to minority shareholders in Vodafone’s takeover of 
Kabel Deutschland in 2013. Hearings took place in May 2019 and a decision was delivered in November 2019 in Vodafone’s favour, rejecting all 
claims by minority shareholders. A number of shareholders appealed which was rejected by the court in December 2021. Several minority 
shareholders filed a further appeal before the Federal Court of Justice which was dismissed in April 2024.  
Germany: price increase class action 
In November 2023, the Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband (Federation of German Consumer Organisations) initiated a class action against 
Vodafone Germany in the Hamm Higher Regional Court. Vodafone Germany implemented price increases of €5 per month for fixed lines services in 
2023 in response to higher costs. The claim alleges that terms regarding price increases in the consumer contracts entered into by Vodafone 
Germany’s customers up until August 2023 are invalid under German civil law and seeks reimbursement of the additional charges plus interest. 
Customers must enter their details onto the register of collective actions on the Federal Office of Justice website in order to participate in the claim. 
The register opened on 23 April 2024.  
Whilst the Group intends to defend the claim, it is not able to determine the likelihood or estimate the amount of any possible financial loss at this 
early stage of the proceedings.  
Germany: claims regarding transfer of data to credit agencies 
Individual consumers are bringing claims against Vodafone Germany and/or the other national network operators alleging that information was 
passed to credit agencies up to February 2024 about contracts for mobile services without consumer consent. The claims seek damages of up to 
€5,000 per contract for GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) infringement. As at 31 March 2024, Vodafone Germany had been notified of 316 
claims filed in various regional courts. The other national network operators are facing similar claims. 
The Group’s position is that the transfer of data about the existence of a consumer contract (and not about payments in relation to the contract) to 
credit agencies is standard practice and justified for the purposes of fraud prevention. However, given the increasing volume of claims, Vodafone 
Germany has stopped this activity.  
Although the outcome of these claims is uncertain and consequently it is not possible to estimate a potential financial loss, if any, at this stage, the 
Group believes it has valid defences and that no present obligation exists based on all available evidence.  
Germany: investigation by federal data protection authority 
In 2021, the BfDI (Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information) started an investigation into potential breaches of the 
GDPR in relation to the systems used by Vodafone Germany’s sales partners to manage customer data. 
Vodafone Germany is working cooperatively with the authority to discuss the circumstances giving rise to these issues and is currently conducting 
settlement talks with the aim of reaching a constructive resolution of the proceedings. Under the GDPR the authority has the power to impose fines 
of up to 2% of the Group’s annual revenue from the preceding financial year. 
A provision immaterial to the financial statements has been recorded. 
Italy: Iliad v Vodafone Italy 
In July 2019, Iliad filed a claim for €500 million against Vodafone Italy in the Civil Court of Milan. The claim alleges anti-competitive behaviour in 
relation to customer portability and certain advertising campaigns by Vodafone Italy. The main hearing on the merits of the claim took place on 8 
June 2021. On 17 April 2023, the Civil Court issued a judgement in Vodafone Italy's favour and rejected Iliad's claim for damages in full. Iliad filed an 
appeal before the Court of Appeal of Milan in June 2023. The appeal process is ongoing. 
The Group is currently unable to estimate any possible loss in this claim in the event of an adverse judgement on appeal but, while the outcome is 
uncertain, the Group believes it has valid defences and that it is probable that no present obligation exists.

Greece: Papistas Holdings SA, Mobile Trade Stores (formerly Papistas SA) and Athanasios and Loukia Papistas v Vodafone Greece  
In October 2019, Mr. and Mrs. Papistas, and companies owned or controlled by them, filed several claims against Vodafone Greece with a total value 
of approximately €330 million for purported damage caused by the alleged abuse of dominance and wrongful termination of a franchise 
arrangement with a Papistas company. Lawsuits which the Papistas claimants had previously brought against Vodafone Greece, including one also 
citing Vodafone Group Plc and certain Directors and officers of Vodafone as defendants, were either withdrawn or left dormant. Vodafone Greece 
filed a counter claim and all claims were heard in February 2020. All of the Papistas claims were rejected by the Athens Court of First Instance 
because the stamp duty payments required to have the merits of the case considered had not been made.  Vodafone Greece’s counter claim was 
also rejected. The Papistas claimants and Vodafone Greece each filed appeals. The appeal hearings took place on 23 February and 11 May 2023. 
Judgement has been received and the Court dismissed both of the appeals because the stamp duty payments had again not been made, except for 
one aspect of the proceedings which will be dealt with at a further hearing in February 2025. Whether the Papistas claimants will appeal the 
judgement is unknown as at the date of this report.  
Vodafone is continuing vigorously to defend the claims and based on the progress of the litigation so far the Group believes that it is highly unlikely 
that there will be an adverse ruling for the Group. On this basis, the Group does not expect the outcome of these claims to have a material financial 
impact.   
UK: Phones 4U in Administration v Vodafone Limited, Vodafone Group Plc and Others 
In December 2018, the administrators of former UK indirect seller, Phones 4U, sued the three main UK mobile network operators (‘MNOs’), 
including Vodafone, and their parent companies in the English High Court. The administrators alleged collusion between the MNOs to withdraw 
their business from Phones 4U thereby causing its collapse. The judge ordered that there should be a split trial between liability and damages. The 
first trial on liability took place from May to July 2022. On 10 November 2023, the High Court issued a judgement in Vodafone’s favour and rejected 
Phones 4U’s allegations that the defendants were in breach of competition law, consistent with Vodafone’s previously stated position that a present 
obligation does not exist. Phones 4U has been granted permission to appeal the judgement from the Court of Appeal. The appeal hearing will take 
place in May 2025. 
The Group intends to vigorously defend the appeal and is not able to estimate any possible loss in the event of an adverse judgement on appeal. 
South Africa: Kenneth Makate v Vodacom (Pty) Limited  
Mr Kenneth Makate, a former employee of Vodacom Pty Limited (‘Vodacom South Africa’), started legal proceedings in 2008 claiming 
compensation for a business idea that led to the development of a service known as ‘Please Call Me’ (‘PCM’). In July 2014, the Gauteng High Court 
(‘the High Court’) ruled that Mr Makate had proven the existence of a contract, but that Vodacom South Africa was not bound by that contract 
because the responsible director did not have authority to enter into such an agreement on Vodacom South Africa’s behalf. The High Court and 
Supreme Court of Appeal (‘the SCA’) turned down Mr Makate’s application for leave to appeal in December 2014 and March 2015, respectively. 
In April 2016, the Constitutional Court of South Africa (‘the Constitutional Court’) granted leave to appeal and upheld Mr Makate’s appeal. It found 
that Vodacom South Africa is bound by an agreement and ordered the parties to negotiate, in good faith, and agree a reasonable compensation 
amount payable to Mr Makate or, in the event of a deadlock, for the matter to be referred to Vodacom Group’s Chief Executive Officer (‘the CEO’) for 
determination. Mr Makate’s application for the aforementioned order to be varied from the determination of an amount to a compensation model 
based on a share of revenue, was dismissed by the Constitutional Court. In accordance with the Constitutional Court order, and after negotiations 
failed, the CEO issued his determination on 9 January 2019. However, the CEO’s award of R47 million (€2 million) was rejected by Mr Makate, who 
subsequently brought an application in the High Court for judicial review against the CEO’s determination and award.   
The High Court, in a judgement delivered on 8 February 2022, set aside the CEO’s determination and ordered him to reassess the amount 
employing a set of criteria which would have resulted in the payment of a higher compensation amount, for the benefit of Mr Makate, than that 
determined by the CEO. Vodacom South Africa appealed against the judgement and the order of the High Court to the SCA. The SCA heard the 
appeal on 9 May 2023 and its judgement was handed down on 6 February 2024. A majority of three judges, with a minority of two judges dissenting, 
dismissed the appeal and ruled that Mr Makate is entitled to be paid 5% - 7.5% of the total revenue of the PCM product from March 2001 to the date 
of the judgement, plus interest.  
On 27 February 2024, Vodacom South Africa applied for leave to appeal the judgement and order of the SCA to the Constitutional Court, resulting in 
the suspension of the operation of the judgement and order of the SCA. Mr Makate is opposing Vodacom South Africa’s application for leave to 
appeal. Vodacom South Africa is challenging the SCA’s judgement and order on various grounds including, but not limited to the SCA ignoring the 
evidence placed before it on the computation of the quantum of compensation payable to Mr Makate, and the SCA issuing orders that are legally 
unenforceable. 
The CEO’s determination in 2019 amounted to R47 million (€2 million). The minority judgement of the SCA raised Mr Makate’s compensation to 
approximately R186 million (€9 million), while the SCA majority judgement would entitle Mr Makate to a minimum compensation amount of R29 
billion (€1.4 billion). Consequently, the range of the possible compensation outcomes in this matter is very wide. 
The amount ultimately payable to Mr Makate is uncertain and will depend on the determination of the Constitutional Court to grant Vodacom 
South Africa’s application for leave to appeal and, if granted, on the success of Vodacom South Africa’s appeal against the judgement and order of 
the SCA, on the merits of the case. The Group is continuing to challenge the level of compensation payable to Mr Makate and a provision immaterial 
to the financial statements has been recorded.

29. Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings (continued)  
UK: Mr Justin Gutmann v Vodafone Limited and Vodafone Group Plc  
In November 2023, Mr Gutmann issued claims in the Competition Appeal Tribunal seeking permission, as a proposed class representative, to bring 
collective proceedings against the four UK MNOs and their respective parent companies. Vodafone Group Plc and Vodafone Limited are named 
defendants to one of the claims with an alleged value of £1.4 billion (approximately €1.6 billion), including interest. It is alleged that Vodafone and 
the other MNOs used their alleged market dominance to overcharge customers after the expiry of the minimum terms of certain mobile contracts 
(referred to as a ‘loyalty penalty’).  
Taking into account all available evidence at this stage, the Group’s assessment is that the allegations are without merit and it intends to defend the 
claim. The Group is currently unable to estimate any possible loss in regards to this issue but, while the outcome is uncertain, the Group believes it is 
probable that no present obligation exists. 
 
30. Related party transactions 
The Group has a number of related parties including joint arrangements and associates, pension schemes and Directors and 
Executive Committee members (see note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint arrangements’, note 25 ‘Post employment 
benefits’ and note 23 ‘Directors and key management compensation’). 
Transactions with joint arrangements and associates 
Related party transactions with the Group’s joint arrangements and associates primarily comprise fees for the use of products and services including 
network airtime and access charges, fees for the provision of network infrastructure and cash pooling arrangements. No related party transactions have 
been entered into during the year which might reasonably affect any decisions made by the users of these consolidated financial statements except as

Transactions with Directors other than compensation 
During the three years ended 31 March 2024 and as of 14 May 2024, no Director nor any other executive officer, nor any associate of any Director or any 
other executive officer, was indebted to the Group. During the three years ended 31 March 2024 and as of 14 May 2024, the Group has not been a party 
to any other material transaction, or proposed transactions, in which any member of the key management personnel (including Directors, any other 
executive officer, senior manager, any spouse or relative of any of the foregoing or any relative of such spouse) had or was to have a direct or indirect 
material interest.

A full list of all of our subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings is detailed below.
A full list of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated undertakings (as defined in the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008) as at 31 March 2024 is detailed below. No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation. 
Unless otherwise stated the Company’s subsidiaries all have share capital consisting solely of ordinary shares and are indirectly held. The 
percentage held by Group companies reflect both the proportion of nominal capital and voting rights unless otherwise stated. Summarised financial 
information is provided in respect of the Group’s most significant joint arrangements and associates in note 12 ‘Investments in associates and joint
arrangements’.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an entity directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has existing rights that give it the 
current ability to direct the activities that affect the Company’s returns and exposure or rights to variable returns from the entity. The results of 
subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up 
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their 
accounting policies into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. 
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling 
shareholder’s share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Notes:  
1     These reserves are not distributable.  
2     Own shares relate to treasury shares which are purchased out of distributable profits and therefore reduce reserves available for distribution.  
3     The Company has determined what amounts within this reserve are distributable and non-distributable in accordance with the guidance provided by ICAEW TECH 02/17BL and the requirements of 
UK law. In accordance with UK Companies Act 2006 s831(2), a public company may make a distribution only if, after giving effect to such distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the 
aggregate of its’ called up share capital and non-distributable reserves. 
4     Represents the irrevocable and non-discretionary share buyback programmes which completed on 15 March 2023.  
5     Includes the impact of the Company’s cash flow hedges with €2,051 million net loss deferred to other comprehensive income during the year (2023: €2,356 million net gain), €247 million net gain 
(2023: €895 million net gain) recycled to the income statement, and a tax credit of €575 million (2023: tax charge of €365 million). These hedges primarily relate to foreign exchange exposure on 
fixed borrowings, with any foreign exchange on nominal balances directly impacting income statement in each period but interest cash flows unwinding to the income statement over the life of the 
hedges (up to 2063). See note 22 ‘Capital and financial risk management’ to the consolidated financial statements for further details.

Notes to the Company financial statements 
 
 
1. Basis of preparation 
The separate financial statements of the Company are drawn up in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 
‘Reduced disclosure framework’, (‘FRS 101’). The Company will continue to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 on an 
ongoing basis until such time as it notifies shareholders of any change to its chosen accounting framework.  
The Company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and 
financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.  
The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied: 
− Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, ‘Shared-based payment’ (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options, 
and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined); 
− IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’; 
− Paragraph 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’ (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets 
and liabilities); 
− Paragraph 38 of IAS 1  ‘Presentation of financial statements’ comparative information requirements in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1; 
− The following paragraphs of IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’: 
− 10(d) (statement of cash flows); 
− 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS); 
− 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements); 
− 38B-D (additional comparative information); 
− 40A-D (requirements for a third statement of financial position); 
− 111 (cash flow statement information); and 
− 134-136 (capital management disclosures). 
− IAS 7 ‘Statement of cash flows’; 
− Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 ‘Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors’ (requirement for the disclosure of information 
when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);  
− The requirements in IAS 24 ‘Related party disclosures’ to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a 
group; 
− The requirements in IAS 36 ‘Impairment of asset’ to disclose valuation technique and assumptions used in determining recoverable amount. 
As permitted by section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented in this Annual Report. 
These separate financial statements are not intended to give a true and fair view of the profit or loss or cash flows of the Company. The Company 
has not published its individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its 
own cash flows.  
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The preparation of Company financial statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is 
revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
Management regularly reviews the accounting judgements and critical estimates that could potentially significantly impact the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements and give rise to material adjustments in the Company’s financial statements.  
A source of estimation uncertainty for the Company relates to the review for impairment of investment carrying values and the estimates used 
when determining the recoverable value of the investment. However, there is not considered to be a significant risk of material adjustment from 
revisions to these assumptions within the next financial year (see note 2 ‘Fixed assets’).

Notes to the Company financial statements (continued) 
 
1. Basis of preparation (continued)  
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the financial statements as a whole  
Foreign currencies  
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional rate of currency prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the Company’s functional currency at the rates prevailing on the reporting 
period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial 
transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences arising 
on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the period. Exchange 
differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the period. 
Borrowing costs 
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting period date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences that exist at the reporting period date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a 
right to pay less tax in the future. The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are 
expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting period date. Temporary differences 
arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in 
the Company financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Company statement of financial position when the 
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual 
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The 
accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Company’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates which it manages using derivative 
financial instruments. 
The use of derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles 
on the use of derivative financial instruments consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivative financial 
instruments are included within the income statement unless designated in an effective cash flow hedge relationship when changes in value are 
deferred to other comprehensive income or equity respectively. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes. 
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date. The Company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities (‘fair value 
hedges’) or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign currency or interest rate risks of firm commitments (‘cash flow 
hedges’). Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. 
Fair value hedges 
The Company’s policy is to use derivative financial instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating 
rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk arising, principally, from capital market borrowings. The Company designates these as fair value hedges 
of interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the 
changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective. Gains and losses relating to any ineffective 
portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.

Cash flow hedges 
Cash flow hedging is used by the Company to hedge certain exposures to variability in future cash flows. The portion of gains or losses relating to 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income; 
gains or losses relating to any ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement. However, when the hedged transaction 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-
financial liability. When the hedged item is recognised in the income statement, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in equity for the hedging instrument are reclassified to the income statement. When hedge accounting is discontinued, any gain 
or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the hedged 
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated 
in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
New accounting pronouncements 
To the extent applicable the Company will adopt new accounting policies as set out in note 1 ‘Basis of preparation’ in the consolidated financial statements. 
2. Fixed assets 
Accounting policies 
Shares in Group undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and capital related to share-based payments. Contributions in 
respect of share-based payments are recognised in line with the policy set out in note 7 ‘Share-based payments’. 
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment 
may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying 
amount of the cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior years and an impairment loss reversal is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. 
The Company applies the same methodology and assumptions used by the Group for goodwill impairment testing purposes, as set out in note 4 
‘Impairment losses’ to the consolidated financial statements. For the purposes of the Company’s own impairment assessment, the Group’s 
operations are considered to be a single cash generating unit (‘CGU’) held within the Company’s principal subsidiary, Vodafone European 
Investments. The pooling of the Company’s interests within a single CGU significantly reduces the risk that movements in individual assumptions 
used during the goodwill impairment testing will impact the result of the investment impairment assessment. Whilst the underlying assumptions 
used are a source of estimation uncertainty, they do not give rise to a significant risk of adjustment within the next financial year.

3. Debtors 
Accounting policies 
Amounts owed by subsidiaries are classified and recorded at amortised cost and reduced by allowances for expected credit losses. Estimated future 
credit losses are first recorded on initial recognition of a receivable and are based on estimated probability of default. Individual balances are written 
off when management deems them not to be collectible. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss.

amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a designated fair value hedge 
relationship. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the amount due on settlement or redemption of borrowings is 
recognised over the term of the borrowing.

€1,434 million (2023: €1,855 million). During the year, 87,129,475 (2023: 85,844,124) treasury shares were reissued under Group share schemes and no (2023: 1,463,959,031) shares were 
repurchased under the 2022 scheme which completed on 15 March 2023.   
On 15 March 2024, the Group announced that the Board has approved the capital return through share buybacks of up to €2 billion of proceeds 
from the sale of Vodafone Spain. This is expected to commence following the completion of the sale of Vodafone Spain. 
7. Share-based payments 
Accounting policies 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company’s equity 
instruments. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these share-based payment plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the 
Company’s subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these 
share-based payments. 
The Company currently uses a number of equity-settled share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors and employees of its subsidiaries. 
At 31 March 2024 the Company had 70 million ordinary share options outstanding (2023: 62 million). 
The Company has made capital contributions to its subsidiaries in relation to share-based payments. At 31 March 2024, the cumulative capital 
contribution net of payments received from subsidiaries was €304 million (2023: €261 million). During the year ended 31 March 2024, the total 
capital contribution arising from share-based payments was €115 million (2023: €135 million), with payments of €72 million (2023: €113 million) 
received from subsidiaries.  
Full details of share-based payments, share option schemes and share plans are disclosed in note 26 ‘Share-based payments’ to the consolidated 
financial statements. 
8. Reserves 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s capital management including the approval of dividends. This includes an assessment of both the level of 
reserves legally available for distribution and consideration as to whether the Company would be solvent and retain sufficient liquidity following any 
proposed distribution. 
As Vodafone Group Plc is a Group holding company with no direct operations, its ability to make shareholder distributions is dependent on its ability 
to receive funds for such purposes from its subsidiaries in a manner which creates profits available for distribution for the Company. The major 
factors that impact the ability of the Company to access profits held in subsidiary companies at an appropriate level to fulfil its needs for 
distributable reserves on an ongoing basis include: 
− the absolute size of the profit pools either currently available for distribution or capable of realisation into distributable reserves in the relevant 
entities;

Performance metrics 
Non-GAAP measure 
 Purpose 
Definition 
Adjusted EBITDAaL 
 Adjusted EBITDAaL is used in conjunction with 
financial measures such as operating profit to assess 
our operating performance and profitability.  
Adjusted EBITDAaL is operating profit after 
depreciation on lease-related right of use assets and 
interest on lease liabilities but excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and gains/losses on disposal of owned 
assets and excluding share of results of equity 
accounted associates and joint ventures, impairment 
losses/reversals, restructuring costs arising from 
discrete restructuring plans, other income and 
expense and significant items that are not considered 
by management to be reflective of the underlying 
performance of the Group. 
 It is a key external metric used by the investor 
community to assess performance of our operations.  
 
It is our segment performance measure in accordance 
with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments).  
Adjusted EBITDAaL margin is Adjusted EBITDAaL divided by Revenue.  
Organic growth 
Organic growth presents performance on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, mergers and acquisitions, the 
hyperinflation adjustment in Turkey and other adjustments to improve the comparability of results between periods.     
Organic growth is calculated for revenue and profitability metrics, as follows:  
− Adjusted EBITDAaL; 
− Revenue; 
− Group service revenue excluding Turkey; 
− Group Adjusted EBITDAaL excluding Turkey; 
− Service revenue; 
− Mobile service revenue; 
− Fixed service revenue;  
− Vodafone Business service revenue (Group and Operating segments); and 
− Financial services revenue in South Africa. 
Whilst organic growth is not intended to be a substitute for reported growth, nor is it superior to reported growth, we believe that the measure 
provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons:    
− It provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of certain factors unrelated to its operating 
performance; 
− It is used for internal performance analysis; and 
− It facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies (although the term ‘organic’ is not a defined term under GAAP and may not, 
therefore, be comparable with similarly-titled measures reported by other companies). 
We have not provided a comparative in respect of organic growth rates as the current rates describe the change between the beginning and end of 
the current period, with such changes being explained by the commentary in this document. If comparatives were provided, significant sections of 
the commentary for prior periods would also need to be included, reducing the usefulness and transparency of this document.

Non-GAAP measure 
 Purpose 
Definition 
Adjusted profit attributable 
to owners of the parent 
 
This metric is used in the calculation of Adjusted basic 
earnings per share. 
Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent 
excludes restructuring costs arising from discrete 
restructuring plans, amortisation of customer bases 
and brand intangible assets, impairment 
losses/reversals, other income and expense and mark-
to-market and foreign exchange movements, together 
with related tax effects.  
Adjusted basic earnings per 
share 
 
This performance measure is used in discussions with 
the investor community. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share is Adjusted profit 
attributable to owners of the parent divided by the 
weighted average number of shares outstanding. This 
is the same denominator used when calculating basic 
earnings per share. 
Adjusted EBITDAaL and Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent 
The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDAaL and Adjusted profit attributable to owners of the parent to their closest equivalent GAAP measures,

Return on Capital Employed 
Non-GAAP measure 
 Purpose 
 Definition 
Return on Capital 
Employed ('ROCE') 
 ROCE is a metric used by the investor community and 
reflects how efficiently we are generating profit with 
the capital we deploy.   
 We calculate ROCE by dividing Operating profit by the 
average of capital employed as reported in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. Capital 
employed includes borrowings, cash and cash 
equivalents, derivative financial instruments included 
in trade and other receivables/payables, short term 
investments, collateral assets, financial liabilities under 
put option arrangements and equity.  
Pre-tax ROCE (controlled) 
Post-tax ROCE (controlled 
and associates/joint 
ventures) 
 As above. 
 We calculate pre-tax ROCE (controlled) by using 
Operating profit excluding interest on lease liabilities, 
restructuring costs arising from discrete restructuring 
plans, impairment losses/reversals, other income and 
expense, the impact of hyper-inflationary adjustments 
in Turkey and the share of results of equity accounted 
associates and joint ventures. On a post-tax basis, the 
measure includes our Adjusted share of results from 
associates and joint ventures and a notional tax charge. 
Capital is equivalent to net operating assets and is 
calculated as the average of opening and closing 
balances of: property, plant and equipment (including 
leased assets and lease liabilities), intangible assets 
(including goodwill), operating working capital 
(including held for sale assets and excluding derivative 
balances) and provisions, excluding the impact of 
hyper-inflationary adjustments in Turkey. Other assets 
that do not directly contribute to returns are excluded 
from this measure and include other investments, 
current and deferred tax balances and post 
employment benefits. On a post-tax basis, ROCE also 
includes our investments in associates and joint 
ventures.

AGM
Our fourtieth AGM will be held at The Pavilion, Vodafone House, 
Newbury RG14 2FN on Tuesday, 30 July 2024 at 10.00 am.
Shareholder communications
We are taking steps to reduce our impact on our planet. The use of 
electronic communications, rather than printed paper documents, 
means information about the Company can be accessed through 
emails or the Company’s website, thus supporting our efforts to 
reduce our impact on the environment.
A growing number of our shareholders have opted to receive 
communications from us electronically. Shareholders who have done 
so will be sent an email alert containing a link to the relevant 
documents.
We encourage all our shareholders to sign up for this service. You can 
register for this service at shareview.co.uk or by contacting Equiniti on 
the telephone number provided on the left of this page.
See vodafone.com/investor  
for further information about this service
ShareGift
We support ShareGift, the charity share donation scheme (registered 
charity number 1052686). Through ShareGift, shareholders who 
have only a very small number of shares, which might be considered 
uneconomic to sell, are able to donate them to charity. Donated 
shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift, with the proceeds being 
passed on to a wide range of UK charities.

Warning to shareholders (‘boiler room’ scams)
Over recent years, we have become aware of investors who have 
received unsolicited calls or correspondence, in some cases 
purporting to have been issued by us, concerning investment matters. 
These callers typically make claims of highly profitable investment 
opportunities that turn out to be worthless or simply do not exist. 
These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies and 
individuals and are commonly known as ‘boiler room’ scams. Investors 
are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice or offers to buy 
shares. If it sounds too good to be true, it often is.

Dividends
Read more on the dividend amount per share on pages 31 and 168.
Euro dividends
Dividends are declared in euros to align with the functional currency 
of the Company, and paid in euros and pounds sterling according to 
where the shareholder is resident. Cash dividends to ADS holders are 
paid by the ADS depositary bank in US dollars. The foreign exchange 
rates at which dividends declared in euros are converted into pounds 
sterling and US dollars are calculated based on the average exchange 
rate of the five business days during the week prior to the payment of 
the dividend.
Payment of dividends by direct credit
We pay cash dividends directly to shareholders’ bank or building 
society accounts. This ensures secure delivery and means dividend 
payments are credited to shareholders’ designated accounts on the 
same day payment is made. For ordinary shareholders, a dividend 
confirmation covering both the interim and final dividends paid during 
the financial year is sent to shareholders at the time of the interim 
dividend in February. 
Dividend reinvestment plan
We offer a dividend reinvestment plan which allows holders of 
ordinary shares who choose to participate to use their cash dividends 
to acquire additional shares in the Company. These are purchased on 
their behalf by the plan administrator, Equiniti, through a low-cost 
dealing arrangement. For ADS holders, J.P. Morgan, through its 
transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, maintains the Global Invest 
Direct Program, which is a direct purchase and sale plan for depositary 
receipts with a dividend reinvestment facility.

The Company is not aware of any other changes in the interests 
disclosed under DTR 5 between 31 March 2024 and 13 May 2024.
As far as the Company is aware, between 1 April 2021 and 13 May 
2024, no shareholder held 3% or more of the voting rights 
attributable to the ordinary shares of the Company other than 
(i) J.P. Morgan, as custodian of our ADR program and (ii) e&,

The rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company held by 
these shareholders are identical in all respects to the rights attaching 
to all the ordinary shares of the Company. As at 13 May 2024, the 
Directors are not aware of any other interest of 3% or more in the 
ordinary share capital of the Company. The Company is not directly or 
indirectly owned or controlled by any foreign government or any 
other legal entity. There are no arrangements known to the Company 
that could result in a change of control of the Company.
Other information
Articles of Association and applicable English law
The following description summarises certain provisions of the 
Company’s Articles of Association and applicable English law. This 
summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act 
2006 and the Company’s Articles of Association. The Company is a 
public limited company under the laws of England and Wales. The 
Company is registered in England and Wales under the name 
Vodafone Group Public Limited Company with the registration 
number 1833679.
Full details of where copies of the Articles of Association can be 
obtained are detailed on page 252 under ‘Documents on display’.
All of the Company’s ordinary shares are fully paid. Accordingly, no 
further contribution of capital may be required by the Company from 
the holders of such shares.
English law specifies that any alteration to the Articles of Association 
must be approved by a special resolution of the Company’s 
shareholders.
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association do not specifically restrict the 
objects of the Company.
Directors
The Directors are empowered under the Articles of Association to 
exercise all the powers of the Company subject to any restrictions in 
the Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 (as defined in the 
Articles of Association) and any special resolution.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association, a Director cannot vote 
in respect of any proposal in which the Director, or any person 
connected with the Director, has a material interest other than by 
virtue of the Director’s interest in the Company’s shares or other 
securities. However, this restriction on voting does not apply in certain 
circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association.
The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the 
aggregate amount of all liabilities and obligations of the Group 
outstanding at any time shall not exceed an amount equal to 1.5 
times the aggregate of the Group’s share capital and reserves 
calculated in the manner prescribed in the Articles of Association, 
unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the Company’s 
shareholders.
Purchase of own shares
The Company can make market purchases of its own shares or agree 
to do so in the future provided it is duly authorised by its members in 
a general meeting and subject to and in accordance with section 701 
of the Companies Act 2006. Such authority was given at the 2023 
AGM.

Dividend rights
Holders of 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are entitled to be paid 
in respect of each financial year, or other accounting period of the 
Company, a fixed cumulative preferential dividend of 7% p.a. on the 
nominal value of the fixed rate shares. A fixed cumulative preferential 
dividend may only be paid out of available distributable profits that 
the Directors have resolved should be distributed.
The fixed rate shares do not have any other right to share in the 
Company’s profits.
Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, 
declare dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the 
amount recommended by the Directors. The Board of Directors may 
also pay interim dividends. No dividend may be paid other than out of 
profits available for distribution.
Dividends on ordinary shares can be paid to shareholders in 
whichever currency the Directors decide, using an appropriate 
exchange rate for any currency conversions that are required.
If a dividend has not been claimed for one year after the date of the 
resolution passed at a general meeting declaring that dividend or the 
resolution of the Directors providing for payment of that dividend, the 
Directors may invest the dividend or use it in some other way for the 
benefit of the Company until the dividend is claimed. If the dividend 
remains unclaimed for 12 years after the relevant resolution either 
declaring that dividend or providing for payment of that dividend, 
it will be forfeited and belong to the Company.
Voting rights
At a general meeting of the Company, when voting on substantive 
resolutions (i.e. any resolution that is not a procedural resolution) 
each shareholder who is entitled to vote and is present in person or 
by proxy has one vote for every share held (a poll vote). Procedural 
resolutions (such as a resolution to adjourn a general meeting or a 
resolution on the choice of Chair of a general meeting) shall be 
decided on a show of hands, where each shareholder who is present 
at the meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held, 
unless a poll is demanded.
Shareholders entitled to vote at general meetings may appoint 
proxies who are entitled to vote, attend and speak at general 
meetings. Two shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute 
a quorum for purposes of a general meeting of the Company.
Under English law, shareholders of a public company such as the 
Company are not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent. 
Record holders of the Company’s ADSs are entitled to attend, speak 
and vote on a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of the 
Company’s shareholders by the depositary’s appointment of them 
as corporate representatives or proxies with respect to the underlying 
ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Alternatively, holders of 
ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the 
depositary or its nominee who will vote the ordinary shares 
underlying their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.
Holders of the Company’s ADSs are entitled to receive notices of 
shareholders’ meetings under the terms of the deposit agreement 
relating to the ADSs.
Employees who hold vested shares in an EquatePlus account are able 
to vote by submitting instructions online through the EquatePlus 
platform. Note there are two vested share accounts with 
Computershare (SPA, in respect of shares arising from a SAYE 
exercise, and MyShareBank, in respect of vested shares from the 
Global Incentive Plan).
Holders of the Company’s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares are only 
entitled to vote on any resolution to vary or abrogate the rights 
attached to the fixed rate shares. Holders have one vote for every fully 
paid 7% cumulative fixed rate share.
Liquidation rights
In the event of the liquidation of the Company, after payment of all 
liabilities and deductions in accordance with English law, the holders 
of the Company’s 7% cumulative fixed rate shares would be entitled 
to a sum equal to the capital paid up on such shares, together with 
certain dividend payments, in priority to holders of the Company’s 
ordinary shares. The holders of the fixed rate shares do not have any 
other right to share in the Company’s surplus assets.
Pre-emptive rights and new issues of shares
Under section 549 of the Companies Act 2006 Directors are, with 
certain exceptions, unable to allot the Company’s ordinary shares or 
securities convertible into the Company’s ordinary shares without the 
authority of the shareholders in a general meeting. In addition, section 
561 of the Companies Act 2006 imposes further restrictions on the 
issue of equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act 2006 
which includes the Company’s ordinary shares and securities 
convertible into ordinary shares) that are, or are to be, paid up wholly 
in cash and not first offered to existing shareholders. The Company’s 
Articles of Association allow shareholders to authorise Directors for a 
period specified in the relevant resolution to allot (i) relevant 
securities generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders and (ii) 
equity securities for cash other than in connection with a pre-emptive 
offer up to an amount specified by the shareholders and free of the 
pre-emption restriction in section 561. At the 2023 AGM the amount 
of relevant securities fixed by shareholders under (i) above and the 
amount of equity securities specified by shareholders under (ii) above 
were in line with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles.
See investors.vodafone.com/agm2024 for further details of such  
proposals provided in the 2024 Notice of AGM. 
Disclosure of interests in the Company’s shares
There are no provisions in the Articles of Association whereby persons 
acquiring, holding or disposing of a certain percentage of the 
Company’s shares are required to make disclosure of their ownership 
percentage, although such requirements exist under the DTRs.
General meetings and notices
Subject to the Articles of Association, AGMs are held at such times 
and places as determined by the Directors of the Company. The 
Directors may also, when they see fit, convene other general 
meetings of the Company. General meetings may also be convened 
on requisition as provided by the Companies Act 2006.
An AGM is required to be called on no less than 21 days’ notice in 
writing. Subject to obtaining shareholder approval on an annual basis,

Shareholder information (continued)
Unaudited information
the Company may call other general meetings on 14 days’ notice. 
The Directors may determine that persons entitled to receive notices 
of meetings are those persons entered on the register at the close of 
business on a day determined by the Directors, but no later than 21 
days before the date the relevant notice is sent. The notice may also 
specify the record date, the time of which shall be determined in 
accordance with the Articles of Association and the Companies Act 
2006.
Under section 336 of the Companies Act 2006, the AGM must be held 
each calendar year and within six months of the Company’s year end.
Variation of rights
If at any time the Company’s share capital is divided into different 
classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, 
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, either with the 
consent in writing of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of 
the shares of that class or at a separate meeting of the holders of the 
shares of that class.
At every such separate meeting all of the provisions of the Articles of 
Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, 
except that (i) the quorum is to be the number of persons (which 
must be at least two) who hold or represent by proxy no less than one 
third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class, or if such 
quorum is not present at an adjourned meeting, one person who 
holds shares of the class regardless of the number of shares he holds; 
(ii) any person present in person or by proxy may demand a poll; and 
(iii) each shareholder will have one vote per share held in that 
particular class in the event a poll is taken. Class rights are deemed 
not to have been varied by the creation or issue of new shares ranking 
equally, with, or subsequent to that class of shares in sharing in profits 
or assets of the Company or by a redemption or repurchase of the 
shares by the Company.
Limitations on transfer, voting and shareholding
As far as the Company is aware there are no limitations imposed on 
the transfer, holding or voting of the Company’s ordinary shares other 
than those limitations that would generally apply to all of the 
shareholders, which apply by law (e.g. due to insider dealing rules) or 
those that apply as a result of failure to comply with a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.
No shareholder has any securities carrying special rights with regard 
to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between holders of securities that may result in 
restrictions on the transfer of securities.
Documents on display
The Company is subject to the information requirements of the US 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ‘Exchange Act’) applicable to 
foreign private issuers. In accordance with these requirements, the 
Company files its Annual Report on Form 20-F and other related 
documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
‘SEC’). These documents may be inspected at the SEC’s public 
reference rooms located at 100 F Street, NE Washington, DC 20549.

Exchange controls
There are no UK Government laws, decrees or regulations that restrict 
or affect the export or import of capital including, but not limited to, 
foreign exchange controls on remittance of dividends on the ordinary 
shares or on the conduct of the Group’s operations.
Taxation
As tax is a complex area, investors should consult their own tax 
adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, the UK and other tax 
consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in their 
particular circumstances.
This section describes, primarily for a US holder (as defined below), 
in general terms, the principal US federal income tax and UK tax 
consequences of owning or disposing of shares or ADSs in the 
Company held as capital assets (for US and UK tax purposes). This 
section does not, however, cover the tax consequences for members 
of certain classes of holders subject to special rules including, for 
example: US expatriates and former long-term residents of the United 
States; officers and employees of the Company; holders who, directly, 
indirectly or by attribution hold 5% or more of the Company’s stock 
(by vote or value); financial institutions; insurance companies; 
individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts; 
tax-exempt organisations; dealers in securities or currencies; investors 
that will hold shares or ADSs as part of straddles, hedging transactions 
or conversion transactions for US federal income tax purposes; 
investors holding shares or ADSs in connection with a trade or 
business conducted outside of the US; or US holders whose 
functional currency is not the US dollar.

Other information

A US holder is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs for US federal 
income tax purposes if they are:
 – an individual citizen or resident of the United States;
 – a US domestic corporation;
 – an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax 
regardless of its source; or
 – a trust, if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the 
trust’s administration and one or more US persons are authorised 
to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has 
validly elected to be treated as a domestic trust for US federal 
income tax purposes.
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal 
income tax purposes holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income 
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend 
on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership. 
Holders that are entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for 
US federal income tax purposes should consult their tax advisers 
concerning the US federal income tax consequences to them and 
their partners of the ownership and disposition of shares or ADSs by 
the partnership.
This section is based on the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations 
thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and on the tax laws 
of the UK, the Double Taxation Convention between the United States 
and the UK (the ‘treaty’) and current HM Revenue and Customs 
(‘HMRC’) practice, all as of the date hereof. These laws and such 
practice are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
This section is further based in part upon the representations of the 
depositary and assumes that each obligation in the deposit 
agreement and any related agreement will be performed in 
accordance with its terms.
For the purposes of the treaty and the US-UK double taxation 
convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the ‘Estate Tax 
Convention’), and for US federal income tax and UK tax purposes, this 
section is based on the assumption that a holder of ADRs evidencing 
ADSs will generally be treated as the owner of the shares in the 
Company represented by those ADRs. Investors should note that a 
ruling by the first-tier tax tribunal in the UK has cast doubt on this 
view, but HMRC has stated that it will continue to apply its long-
standing practice of regarding the holder of such ADRs as holding the 
beneficial interest in the underlying shares. Similarly, the US Treasury 
has expressed concern that US holders of depositary receipts (such as 
holders of ADRs representing our ADSs) may be claiming foreign tax 
credits in situations where an intermediary in the chain of ownership 
between such holders and the issuer of the security underlying the 
depositary receipts, or a party to whom depositary receipts or 
deposited shares are delivered by the depositary prior to the receipt 
by the depositary of the corresponding securities, has taken actions 
inconsistent with the ownership of the underlying security by 
the person claiming the credit, such as a disposition of such security. 
Such actions may also be inconsistent with the claiming of the 
reduced tax rates that may be applicable to certain dividends received 
by certain non-corporate holders, as described below. Accordingly, (i) 
the creditability of any UK taxes and (ii) the availability of the reduced 
tax rates for any dividends received by certain non-corporate US 
holders, each as described below, could be affected by actions taken 
by such parties or intermediaries. Generally exchanges of shares for 
ADRs and ADRs for shares will not be subject to US federal income tax 
or to UK tax other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax.
Taxation of dividends
UK taxation
Under current UK law, there is no requirement to withhold tax from 
the dividends that we pay. Shareholders who are within the scope of 
UK corporation tax will be subject to corporation tax on the dividends 
we pay unless the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain 
other conditions are met. It is expected that the dividends we pay 
would generally be exempt.
Individual shareholders in the Company who are resident in the UK 
will be subject to income tax on the dividends we pay. Dividends will 
be taxable in the UK at the dividend rates applicable where the 
income received is above the dividend allowance (£1,000 in this tax 
year, falling to £500 from 6 April 2024) which is taxed at a nil rate. 
Dividend income is treated as the highest part of an individual 
shareholder’s income and the dividend allowance will count towards 
the basic or higher rate limits (as applicable), which may affect the 
rate of tax due on any dividend income in excess of the allowance.
US federal income taxation
Subject to the passive foreign investment company (‘PFIC’) rules 
described below, a US holder is subject to US federal income taxation 
on the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or 
accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal 
income tax purposes). Distributions in excess of current and 
accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable 
return of capital to the extent of the US holder’s basis in the shares or 
ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.
However, the Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings 
and profits in accordance with US federal income tax accounting 
principles. US holders should, therefore, assume that any distribution 
by the Company with respect to shares will be reported as ordinary 
dividend income. Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder will be 
taxable to the holder at the reduced rate normally applicable to 
long-term capital gains provided that certain requirements are met.
Dividends must be included in income when the US holder, in the 
case of shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or 
constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the 
dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in 
respect of dividends received from other US corporations.
The amount of the dividend distribution to be included in income will 
be the US dollar value of the pound sterling or euro payments made 
determined at the spot pound sterling/US dollar rate or the spot 
euro/US dollar rate, as applicable, on the date the dividends are 
received by the US holder, in the case of shares, or the depositary, in 
the case of ADSs, regardless of whether the payment is in fact 
converted into US dollars at that time. If dividends received in pounds 
sterling or euros are converted into US dollars on the day they are 
received, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise 
any foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the dividend income.
Where UK tax is payable on any dividends received, a US holder may 
be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to a foreign tax credit in 
respect of such taxes.

Taxation of capital gains
UK taxation
A US holder that is not resident in the UK will generally not be liable 
for UK tax in respect of any capital gain realised on a disposal of our 
shares or ADSs.
However, a US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect 
of a gain on the disposal of our shares or ADSs if the US holder:
 – is a citizen of the United States and is resident in the UK;
 – is an individual who realises such a gain during a period of 
‘temporary non-residence’ (broadly, where the individual becomes 
resident in the UK, having ceased to be so resident for a period of 
five years or less, and was resident in the UK for at least four out of 
the seven tax years immediately preceding the year of departure 
from the UK);
 – is a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of being 
centrally managed and controlled in the UK; or
 – is a citizen or a resident of the United States, or a US domestic 
corporation, that has used, held or acquired the shares or ADSs in 
connection with a branch, agency or permanent establishment in 
the UK through which it carries on a trade, profession or vocation in 
the UK.
In such circumstances, relief from double taxation may be available 
under the treaty. Holders who may fall within one of the above 
categories should consult their professional advisers.
US federal income taxation
Subject to the PFIC rules described below, a US holder that sells or 
otherwise disposes of our shares or ADSs generally will recognise a 
capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the 
difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the amount realised 
and the holder’s adjusted tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the 
shares or ADSs. This capital gain or loss will be a long-term capital 
gain or loss if the US holder’s holding period in the shares or ADSs 
exceeds one year.
The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within 
the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of 
losses is subject to limitations.
Additional tax considerations
UK inheritance tax
An individual who is domiciled in the United States (for the purposes 
of the Estate Tax Convention) and is not a UK national will not be 
subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of our shares or ADSs on the 
individual’s death or on a transfer of the shares or ADSs during the 
individual’s lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or 
estate tax is paid, unless the shares or ADSs are part of the business 
property of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed 
base used for the performance of independent personal services. 
Where the shares or ADSs have been placed in trust by a settlor they 
may be subject to UK inheritance tax unless, when the trust was 
created, the settlor was domiciled in the United States and was not a 
UK national. Where the shares or ADSs are subject to both UK 
inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax 
Convention generally provides a credit against US federal tax liabilities 
for UK inheritance tax paid. The above description does not take into 
account any change in law or practice that may arise from proposed 
changes announced by the UK government on 6 March 2024 to the 
taxation of non-UK domiciled individuals, and specific professional 
advice should be sought on this matter if relevant.    
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
Stamp duty will, subject to certain exceptions, be payable on any 
instrument transferring our shares to the custodian of the depositary 
at the rate of 1.5% on the amount or value of the consideration if on 
sale or on the value of such shares if not on sale. Stamp duty reserve 
tax (‘SDRT’), at the rate of 1.5% of the amount or value of the 
consideration or the value of the shares, could also be payable in 
these circumstances but no SDRT will be payable if stamp duty equal 
to such SDRT liability is paid. However, such transfers will not attract 
stamp duty or SDRT where they satisfy the conditions of an 
exemption, including exemptions which can apply to certain capital 
raising or qualifying listing arrangements. Specific professional advice 
should be sought before paying a 1.5% SDRT or stamp duty charge in 
any circumstances. 
No stamp duty should, in practice, be required to be paid on any 
transfer of our ADSs provided that the ADSs and any separate 
instrument of transfer are executed and retained at all times outside 
the UK.
A transfer of our shares in registered form will attract ad valorem 
stamp duty, generally at the rate of 0.5% of the purchase price of the 
shares. There is no charge to ad valorem stamp duty on gifts.
SDRT is generally payable on an unconditional agreement to transfer 
our shares in registered form at 0.5% of the amount or value of the 
consideration for the transfer, but if, within six years of the date of the 
agreement, an instrument transferring the shares is executed and 
stamped, any SDRT that has been paid would be repayable or, if the 
SDRT has not been paid, the liability to pay the tax (but not 
necessarily interest and penalties) would be cancelled. However, an 
agreement to transfer our ADSs will not give rise to SDRT.
PFIC rules
We do not believe that our shares or ADSs will be stock of a PFIC 
for US federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year or 
the foreseeable future. This conclusion is a factual determination 
that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are a PFIC, 
US holders of shares would be required (i) to pay a special US addition 
to tax on certain distributions and (ii) any gain realised on the sale 
or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not 
be treated as a capital gain unless a US holder elects to be taxed 
annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or 
ADSs.
Otherwise a US holder would be treated as if he or she has realised 
such gain and certain ‘excess distributions’ rateably over the holding 
period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax 
rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated. An 
interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such 
preceding year beginning with the first such year in which our shares 
or ADSs were treated as stock in a PFIC would also apply. In addition, 
dividends received from us would not be eligible for the reduced rate 
of tax described above under ‘Taxation of dividends – US federal 
income taxation’.
Back-up withholding and information reporting
Payments of dividends and other proceeds to a US holder with 
respect to shares or ADSs, by a US paying agent or other US 
intermediary, will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service and to 
the US holder as may be required under applicable regulations. 
Back-up withholding may apply to these payments if the US holder 
fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or 
certification of exempt status or fails to comply with applicable 
certification requirements.
Certain US holders are not subject to back-up withholding. US holders 
should consult their tax advisers about these rules and any other 
reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or disposition 
of shares or ADSs, including requirements related to the holding of 
certain foreign financial assets.

Other information

The Company was incorporated under English law in 1984 as Racal 
Strategic Radio Limited (registered number 1833679). After various 
name changes, 20% of Racal Telecom Plc share capital was offered 
to the public in October 1988. The Company was fully demerged 
from Racal Electronics Plc and became an independent company 
in September 1991 at which time it changed its name to Vodafone 
Group Plc. Since then we have entered into various transactions 
which impacted the development of the Group. The most significant 
in the year ended 31 March 2024 are summarised below. 
 – On 29 March 2023, the Vodafone Group announced the initiation 
of procedures for a statutory merger and squeeze-out of minority 
shareholders in Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (’KDG’). This is 
procedure is now complete and Vodafone Group own 100% of 
KDG.
 – On 14 June 2023 Vodafone Group and CK Hutchison Group 
Telecom Holdings Limited (“CKHGT”), a wholly owned subsidiary of 
CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, entered into binding agreements in 
relation to a combination of their UK telecommunication 
businesses, respectively Vodafone UK and Three UK (the 
“Transaction”). Vodafone will own 51% of the combined business 
(“MergeCo”) and CKHGT 49%. Vodafone UK will be contributed 
with £4.3 billion and Three UK with £1.7 billion, subject to 
customary completion adjustments. MergeCo’s aggregate 
consolidated free cash flow will be distributed to the shareholders 
at least on an annual basis, subject to a target aggregate 
consolidated net financial debt of 2.5x MergeCo’s 12 month rolling 
Adjusted EBITDAaL.
 – On 18 July 2023 further to the announcement of a co-control 
partnership for Vantage Towers on 9 November 2022, Vodafone 
Group announced that, based on commitments secured by the 
consortium of long-term infrastructure investors led by Global 
Infrastructure Partners and KKR (together the “Consortium”), 
Vodafone will receive further proceeds of €500 million, taking total 
net proceeds to €5.4 billion and the Consortium’s ownership in Oak 
Holdings GmbH (“Oak Holdings”) to 40%. Vodafone agreed with the 
Consortium a further 6 month window to acquire additional shares 
in Oak Holdings at the same price, up to a maximum of 50% 
ownership, by the end of 2023. Vodafone’s 12 month option to 
pursue a sell-down to a 50% ownership stake in Oak Holdings 
outside of lock-up provisions and other restrictions will now 
commence on 1 January 2024.
 – On 31 October 2023 Vodafone Group announced that it entered 
into a binding agreement with Zegona Communications plc 
(“Zegona”) in relation to the sale of 100% of Vodafone Holdings 
Europe, S.L.U. (“Vodafone Spain”) (the “Transaction”). On 
completion, Vodafone’s consideration will comprise at least €4.1 
billion in cash and up to €0.9 billion in the form of Redeemable 
Preference Shares which redeem, for an amount comprising the 
subscription price and accrued preferential dividend, no later than 
6 years after closing. Vodafone and Zegona have entered into an 
agreement whereby Vodafone will provide certain services to 
Vodafone Spain for a total annual service charge of c.€110 million.
 – On 15 March 2024 Vodafone Group announced a binding 
agreement to sell 100% of its Italian operations (“Vodafone Italy”) 
to Swisscom AG (“Swisscom”) (the “Transaction”). As part of the 
Transaction, Vodafone and Swisscom have agreed that Vodafone 
will continue to provide certain services (the “Group Services”) to 
Swisscom for up to 5 years. The annual charge for the Group 
Services to be paid by Swisscom to Vodafone for the first year after 
completion is estimated at approximately €350 million, of which 
approximately €176 million reflect charges currently reported 
below Vodafone Italy’s segmental Adjusted EBITDAaL. 
Introduction
Our operating companies are generally subject to regulation 
governing their business activities. Such regulation typically takes the 
form of industry-specific law and regulation covering 
telecommunications services and general competition (anti-trust) law 
applicable to all activities. The following section describes the 
regulatory frameworks and the key regulatory developments at 
national and regional levels and in the European Union (‘EU’), in which 
we had significant interests during the period ended 31 March 2024. 
Many of the regulatory developments reported in the following 
section involve ongoing proceedings or consideration of potential 
proceedings that have not reached a conclusion. Accordingly, we are 
unable to attach a specific level of financial risk to our performance 
from such matters.
EU
In November 2023, the EU adopted a regulation laying down 
harmonised rules on fair access to and fair use of data (the ‘Data Act’). 
The Regulation applies to manufacturers of connected devices, data 
holders, recipients, and providers of data processing services (cloud 
service providers) who will be subject to new requirements to support 
switching and interoperability. 
The Digital Markets Act (‘DMA’) was published in the official EU 
Journal in November 2022 and implementation and enforcement are 
underway. Providers of online platforms who pass the quantitative 
thresholds to be designated as ’gatekeepers’ (annual turnover of €7.5 
billion within the EU or a worldwide market valuation of €75 billion, 
plus 45 million monthly active end-users and 10,000 business users) 
will be subject to ex-ante regulatory obligations under the DMA. As of 
February 2024, six companies have been designated as digital 
gatekeepers across 20 Core Platform Services (CPS). The Digital 
Markets Act became fully enforceable on 7th March 2024, with the six 
companies designated as Digital Gatekeepers taking steps to comply 
with the regulation and evidencing this in the form of a report to be 
audited by the European Commission (‘EC’). 
The European Commission has already launched investigations into 
three Gatekeepers for possible non-compliance with their obligations 
under the law: Apple, Google and Meta. The primary focus of these 
investigations is on conditions and charges for developers within the 
Apple and Google app stores, and in particular on the new Core 
Technology Fee that Apple has announced as part of its DMA 
compliance. The EC commits to conclude proceedings within 12 
months. Companies will receive preliminary findings from the 
Commission that they can respond to and the opportunity to submit 
commitments. When the final decision is out, Gatekeepers will have 
two months to appeal to the EU courts.
The Digital Services Act (‘DSA’) was also published in the official EU 
Journal in November 2022. Online platforms, who have new 
obligations under the DSA, will be required to report their numbers of 
active users to the EC, to inform the designation of Very Large Online 
Platforms (‘VLOPs’) who will be subject to additional risk assessment 
and platform design obligations. As of August 2023, several 
companies have been designated as VLOPs and are now subject to 
regular auditing and regulatory requirements on platform design, risk 
assessment and mitigation. Smaller online platforms and other 
intermediaries became subject to new and updated rules on content 
moderation and due diligence from 17 February 2024.
On 24 April 2023, the EU-Ukraine Association Committee in Trade 
Configuration adopted a decision to apply EU Roam-Like-at-Home, 
intra-EU communication provisions and EU fixed termination rates 
(FTR) and mobile termination rates (MTR) between the EU and 
Ukraine. The time frame for transposition by Ukraine is one year after 
entry into force of this decision. The EC will then assess the 
transposition and in a further step grant internal market treatment

Regulation (continued)
Unaudited information
before the provisions become applicable. On 6 October 2023, the 
EU-Moldova Association Committee in Trade Configuration adopted a 
decision to apply EU Roam-Like-at-Home, intra-EU communication 
provisions and EU fixed and mobile termination rates between the EU 
and Moldova. The time frame for transposition by Moldova is one year 
for intra-EU communications and two years for roaming and MTR/FTR 
after entry into force of this decision. The EC will then assess the 
transposition and in a further step grant internal market treatment 
before the provisions become applicable. 
On 15 January 2024, the EC published a Staff Working Document on 
the findings of the 2023 review of the rules on EU-Roaming fair use 
policies. The Roaming Regulation (EU) 2022/612 requires the EC to 
periodically review the rules on (i) the application of fair use policy 
and (ii) the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the 
abolition of retail roaming surcharges. In its 2023 review, the EC 
concluded that the current safeguards are working and remain 
unchanged.
On 15 September 2022, the EC adopted its draft Cyber Resilience Act 
(‘CRA’), introducing horizontal cybersecurity requirements for 
products with digital elements and associated services that are placed 
on the European single market. Products in scope will be subject to 
conformity assessment. Highly critical products will be subject to 
European cybersecurity certification schemes. The EC’s draft CRA has 
entered the co-legislative process which is likely to be completed in 
Q2/2024 and apply 18 months to three years thereafter. In December 
2023, negotiators finalised the text of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act 
(‘AI Act’), the world’s first comprehensive, horizontal regulation for AI 
systems. The final text confirms the risk-based approach, where AI 
systems surpassing a certain risk threshold are either prohibited 
outright, or subject to proportionate regulatory obligations. The final 
text also includes a compromise on General Purpose AI systems, 
whereby all providers of these foundational technologies are subject 
to some baseline regulatory requirements (transparency, record 
keeping and compliance with Copyright law) and systems that are 
deemed to be high impact (based on an evaluation of compute 
power) subject to additional risk mitigation rules. 
The Gigabit Infrastructure Act (‘GIA’) (which revises the 2014 
Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (‘BCRD’) is in its last stages before 
adoption. The GIA aims to reduce the cost of deploying gigabit 
electronic communication networks. While some of the proposed 
measures were watered down in the legislative process, welcomed 
proposals include the right to submit applications for all permits (or 
renewals) and rights of way in electronic format via a ‘Single 
Information Point’, permit fees not exceeding administrative costs, 
permit exemptions to civil engineering works, conditional tacit 
approval on permits and access to rooftops. The European Parliament 
proposed a ban on intra-EU communications retail surcharges which 
is unrelated to the GIA proposal, and this could have material impact 
on telecommunications operators. The legislators agreed to prolong 
the current caps until 1 January 2029. Abolition of surcharges from 
then onwards is conditional on (i) an EC review/impact assessment by 
2027 and (ii) an EC implementing act on fair use provisions by 2028. 
Otherwise, the caps will expire in 2032. The GIA determines that 
telecommunications operators may voluntarily apply ‘call-like-at-
home’ charging from 1 Jan 2025 subject to fair use policy. 
The EC & European Parliament adopted the GIA on 29 April 2024. This 
will replace the 2014 BCRD. The new law aims to simplify and 
accelerate the roll-out of high-speed networks, such as fibre and 5G, 
with a view to achieving Europe’s connectivity objectives and targets 
set out in the digital compass for this decade.
The new regulation also aims to lower the unnecessarily high costs of 
the deployment of high-capacity networks partially caused by 
permit-granting procedures. The latter will be simplified through a 
mandatory conciliation mechanism between public sector bodies and 
telecommunication operators. In addition, given that the present retail 
price cap for regulated intra-EU communications will expire on 14 May 
2024, the current caps of 19 eurocents per minute for calls and 6 
eurocents per SMS message are extended until 30 June 2032 to 
ensure protection, especially for vulnerable consumers. 
The text will be published in the EU’s Official Journal and enter 
into force before the end of May. The new law will apply 18 
months after its entry into force with some specific provisions 
applying at a later stage.
The EC adopted a recommendation on the promotion of Gigabit 
Connectivity which seeks to provide guidance to National Regulatory 
Authorities on the conditions of access to the telecommunications 
networks of operators with significant market power ‘SMP’. This 
instrument replaces the 2010 Next Generation Access 
Recommendation and the 2013 Non-discrimination and Costing 
Methodologies Recommendation. BEREC had adopted an opinion on 
the draft and had raised several issues, including the lack of alignment 
with the European Electronic Communications Code. It had specifically 
mentioned, for example, that there is a lack of sources or impact 
analysis clearly demonstrating that deregulating SMP Operators (e.g. 
removing remedies such as price regulation, allowing for an increase in 
copper access prices) speeds up very high capacity networks 
deployment/take-up. The EC took the BEREC Opinion into account, 
yet no substantial modifications were made. The EC also adopted, in 
February 2024, a digital connectivity package aimed at fostering 
innovation, security and resilience of digital infrastructures. The 
package includes two components; a white paper and a 
recommendation. The white paper entitled“How to master Europe’s 
digital infrastructure needs?” analyses the challenges that Europe 
faces regarding the rollout of future connectivity networks, and 
presents possible scenarios to attract investments, foster innovation, 
increase security, and achieve a true Digital Single Market. The 
recommndationr elates to the security and resilience of submarine 
cable infrastructures, focusing on improving submarine cable security 
and resilience, through better EU coordination of governance and 
funding. A public consultation on the White Paper scenarios is 
on-going until 30 June 2024. 
Country specific
Germany
Licences for frequency allocations at 800MHz, parts of 1800MHz, and 
2600MHz will expire at the end of 2025. Vodafone Germany currently 
holds allocations at 800MHz and 2600MHz. BNetzA is currently 
assessing its options on how to proceed on the reallocation of this 
spectrum. It may either re-auction the spectrum, or prolong the 
existing licences, or a combination of these. BNetzA is expected to 
make a final decision on next steps in Q2/2024.
In 2019, Vodafone acquired spectrum at 2.1GHz and 3.6GHz. The 
spectrum allocation includes coverage obligations which, depending 
on the specifics of the obligation, have to be fulfilled by end of either 
2022 or 2024. All mobile network operators have reported on time on 
the status of obligation fulfilment for the 2022 obligations, including 
given judicial or factual circumstances hindering fulfilment. BNetzA 
has assessed the reports, including Vodafone’s, and informed 
Vodafone about the results at the end of September 2023. Currently, 
BNetzA is conducting an official hearing with Vodafone on possible 
fines for a minor number of cases of non-fulfilment. BNetzA is 
expected to issue a final decision on potential fines after completion of 
the hearing in Q2/2024.

values. Ofcom expects the changes to be introduced later in 2024. 
Ofcom believes the move to absolute value amounts will aid

purchasing decisions. 
The UK industry continues to work towards the introduction of a new 
One-Touch Switching process. The introduction of the industry wide

Vodacom: South Africa (‘SA’)
The NRA (‘ICASA’) has concluded a Review of the Pro-competitive 
Conditions imposed on relevant licensees in terms of the Call 
Termination Regulations and published its Findings document on 28 
March 2022. ICASA gave notice on 26 May 2023 of its intention to 
proceed with the cost modelling phase with the aim to implement 
revised voice call termination rates. Information requests were issued 
to all Licensees after initial workshop held on 31 May 2023. During 
August 2023 ICASA finalised its consultation on costs standard and 
determined that pure long run incremental cost standard to be used. 
On 22 March 2024, ICASA published a draft amended to the Call 
Termination Regulations for comment. The rates proposed for mobile 
voice call termination, which are currently ZAR 9 cents for large 
operators, will reduce to 7 cents from 01 July 2024, and 4 cents from 
01 July 2025. For small operators, the rates proposed, which are 
currently 13 cents, will reduce to 9 cents from 01 July 2024, and 4 
cents from 01 July 2025. The rates proposed for fixed voice call 
termination, which are currently 6 cents, will reduce to 4 cents from 
01 July 2024, and 1 cent from 01 July 2025. 
On 23 June 2023, the Department of Communication and Digital 
Technology (‘DCDT’) published proposed amendments to the 
Electronic Communications Act (‘Bill’) for comment. Vodacom SA has 
submitted written comments on the Bill on 31 August 2023. The 
adoption of the Bill in its current format could lead to significant 
disruption of the local market, and specifically on Vodacom SA. The 
DCDT indicated that it will wait until the next Parliament has been 
elected (general election date 29 May 2024) before continuing with 
the process of amending the Electronic Communications Act. 
On 29 February 2024, NRA published draft amendments to the 
End-user and Subscriber Service Charter (‘EUSSC’) Regulations 2016, 
relating to bundle usage sequencing & roll-over, and the transfer of 
bundles (or portions thereof) of voice minutes, SMS and data bundles, 
for comment. The deadline for written comments is 15 April 2024.

Spectrum
In Portugal, Vodafone Portugal continues to appeal against certain 
aspects of the auction conditions for the 5G auction, which concluded 
in November 2021, claiming the conditions between new entrants 
and mobile network operators were discriminatory. Legal proceedings 
are still ongoing, with no expected date of conclusion, and the rights 
of use remain in place. 
In Albania, the NRA (AKEP) started preliminary discussions with the 
operators on their interest in the 5G bands up for auction in November 
2023 and published the official Public Consultation mid-January 2024 
for the band 3.4GHz -3.8GHz only. The law frequency 700MHz is still 
being utilised by the media operators. The regulator expects 
comments and proposals on the document with regards to the 
quantity of spectrum to be auctioned, price for 1MHz, coverage 
obligations, size of blocks etc, by April 2024. Vodafone Albania has 
already submitted its comments to the NRA for the 3.4GHz -3.8GHz 
aiming to get usage rights for 100MHz of bandwitch allocation within 
this band.
Concerns over electromagnetic field (‘EMF’) triggered a residents’ 
petition in Greece for the annulment of the 5G Auction Tender 
document. Despite the auction process completing in December 
2020 and the assigned spectrum already being in use by Vodafone 
Greece, the petition against the Tender document was heard in 
January 2022, and a decision by the Council of State is pending, 
estimated to conclude in 2024. In the case that the petition is accepted, 
the assignment of 5G spectrum rights will be declared invalid.
In July 2023, Greek NRA (EETT) informed mobile network operators 
(‘MNO’s) on the results of on-site audits which took place from 
October 2021 to March 2023 and indicated perceived breaches in 
Microwave links emission. In this context, EETT called ΜNOs to submit 
their views. Vodafone Greece replied to NRA’s letter and restored 
licensing status where relevant. Following this procedure, in January 
2024, EETT called ΜNOs to a Hearing via written memorandum. 
Vodafone Greece submitted its memorandum and additional 
supporting documentation on 19 February 2024. Decision is expected 
to conclude in 2024.
Universal Service Obligations (‘USO’) and Consumer Support 
Measures
Vodafone Greece has four active appeals against the NRA (‘EETT’). 
The appeals are in relation to charges amounting to around €16.75 
million. Of this, €9.0 million is in relation to the provision of universal 
services by operator Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation (OTE) 
for the period of 2010 through to 2011. Vodafone Greece has 
appealed these costs, with the hearings due in April 2024 for 2010 
and 2011. The remaining €7.75 million has been imposed on 
Vodafone Greece due to a decision of EETT on the universal service 
obligation USO net costs for the period of 2012 to 2016. Vodafone 
Greece also appealed these costs. 
The appeal has been referred to the Administrative Court of Appeal, 
with the hearing due in November 2024. In addition, the Universal 
Service Net Cost Allocation Decision for the years 2017 to 2019 was 
issued in October 2023, with the Vodafone share (incl. CYTA) being 
calculated at €2.2 million. Vodafone Greece appealed these costs 
before the Administrative Court of Appeal in April 2024. 
Similarly, Vodafone Portugal continues to challenge payment notices 
totalling €34.8 million issued by ANACOM regarding 2012 to 2014 
extraordinary compensation of USO costs.
Access
In Czech Republic, in December 2023 Vodafone announced that it 
agreed with SAZKA a.s. to acquire the mobile virtual network operator 
(MVNO) SAZKAmobil. The transaction was cleared by the competition 
authority and was completed on 1 April 2024.
In Albania the NRA launched a Public Consultation on Mobile 
termination rates aiming to reduce National MTRs from 1.11 lek/
minute with a target to 0.75 lek/minute with a 2 year glidepath. The 
consultation has been finalised and NRA has issued the relevant 
decisions defining the glidepath for national MTRs. International MTRs 
remain deregulated. 
Other Africa and Middle East: Democratic Republic 
of the Congo (DRC); Tanzania; Mozambique; 
Lesotho; Turkey; Egypt. 
Devices and registration
In Tanzania, the Communications Regulator (‘TCRA’) issued 
regulations that introduce a biometric registration requirement for 
SIMs and restrict the number of SIMs a customer may own. The TCRA 
257

Regulation (continued)
Unaudited information
required the disconnection of unverified SIMs in this category by 13 
February 2023. The TCRA conducted inspections and subsequently 
following an inspection on 04 January 2024, the TCRA issued a 
compliance order against Vodacom Tanzania for failure to adhere to 
the regulations by allowing multiple SIM card registrations exceeding 
the allowed limits. Vodacom Tanzania made submissions to the TCRA 
and attended a hearing in this regard. The TCRA issued its final 
decision issuing a penalty of TZS 14 million (approx. €5,000). 
Similarly, in Lesotho, the Minister of Communication introduced new 
SIM Registration regulations, which must be complied with by 24 June 
2023. The regulations require the operator to enact biometric 
registration, establish a central database with the Communications 
Authority (‘LCA’), re-register SIMs with a six-month timeframe and 
enforce penalties of Maloti 5,000 per non-compliant SIM card. On 1 
February 2024, Vodacom Lesotho suspended all unregistered SIMs 
for 3 months (01 Feb- 30 April). Customers will be able to re-activate 
their numbers during the 90 days period, however, post 30 April 2024 
all numbers not re-activated will be terminated. 
Spectrum
In Mozambique, the 5G auction consultation proposes a reserve price 
of $15m per 2x5 of 700MHz, $15m per 2.6GHz and $15m per 3.5GHz. 
The price for 2.6GHz and 3.5GHz is comparatively excessive against 
both Vodafone and neighbouring markets benchmarks. The proposed 
draft auction rules are also against best practice. The 
Communications Regulator has indicated a willingness to introduce 
coverage obligations in exchange for marginally reduced pricing, but 
these are yet to be reflected in the official auction rules. The final 
auction rules are pending the approval of the cabinet of ministers.
In Egypt, the NRA (‘NTRA’) intends to initiate issuance of 5G radio 
frequency spectrum licences; the initial proposal included an 
indicative reserve price of US$450 million and successful bidders are 
expected to incur US$450 million in 5G-related network investment. 
Subsequently, the NTRA submitted a new proposal for the 5G license 
terms and conditions at a cost of US$150 million for 15 years with 
extension to all current licenses without spectrum. Vodafone Egypt 
did not accept this. On 1 January 2024, Vodafone Egypt received an 
offer from the NTRA for the 5G license entailing a license fee of USD 
173m for a 15 year license terms and renewal of the 2G/3G/4G 
licenses until 2038. This offer was valid until 15 January 2024. The 
President had also directed that if the offer was not accepted by at 
least one of the operators, the NTRA will be required to issue new 
offer entailing USD 150m and renewal of existing licenses. On 15 
January 2024, Vodafone Egypt rejected the offer, however, the 
government owned Telecom Egypt accepted the offer and 
announced its acquisition of a 5G license. On this basis, the 
government is trying to push operators to obtain the 5G license under 
similar terms and has currently closed off any possibility of further 
negotiations. For Vodafone Egypt, the proposal is not aligned with its 
business case.
In Turkey, the NRA issued a Board Decision regarding the Procedure 
and Principles on 2G license extension, fee, and obligations. Procedures 
and principles applied to Vodafone Turkey and Turkcell’s licenses that 
expired on 27 April 2023 and TT Mobil’s license that will expire in 2026. 
The extension fee for Vodafone Turkey (900 MHz) is €120 million for 
a six-year extension until 30 April 2029 (excluding 18% VAT). 
Vodafone Turkey paid the extension fee in advance with a capital 
injection and signed the extension agreement effective as of 27 April 
2023. Therefore, the 2G license was extended until 30 April 2029.
Regulatory and legal disputes and fines
In the DRC, Vodacom DRC is in ongoing negotiations with the NRA 
(‘ARPTC’) in relation to new regulatory fees that were first introduced 
in March 2022. On 22 October 2022, the MNOs (including Vodacom 
DRC), Minister of Communications and ARPTC reached an agreement 
and signed a MoU on the new regulatory fees, setting out revised fees 
and modality of payment. The MoU also provides for resolution of any 
pending fines and legal actions in this regard. Execution of each 
party’s obligations under the MoU is ongoing.
In Tanzania, the TCRA found that Vodacom Tanzania had failed to 
comply with regulatory Quality of Service (QoS) targets in May 2023, 
mostly in the Zanzibar region, and has ordered Vodacom Tanzania to 
implement network improvements, with threat of fines if it fails to comply. 
Vodacom Tanzania completed implementation of five sites to address 
this matter in July 2023 and continues to ensure more improvement 
on optimisation is done to ensure coverage is maintained. Vodacom 
plans to roll out 30 additional sites in the Zanzibar in June 2024.
In Lesotho, the NRA (‘LCA’) has found Vodacom Lesotho in 
contravention of rule 6(a)(i) of the Quality of Service Rules, 2023 for 
the four hours network outages experienced on 16 June 2023. The 
LCA issued a fine of Maloti 1.0 million, but suspended execution of the 
fine for a period of 12 months, on condition that Vodacom Lesotho 
does not commit a similar contravention within that period. A recent 
network outage experienced in February 2024 by Vodacom was due 
to a fiber cut resulting from ongoing municipal construction work. 
Vodacom has reported the root cause of the outage to the LCA.
Networks and access
In Turkey, Türk Telekom’s reference offer regarding fibre access was 
approved by the NRA in June 2023, three years after the market 
analysis obligating fibre access. As expected, due to macroeconomic 
conditions, port and transmission prices have been increased by 70% 
effective as of 1 July 2023 within the offer, as well as an increase on 
the one-time fees. Vodafone Turkey continuously engages with 
relevant stakeholders and considers all remedies to ensure better 
access conditions are provided. We are also planning to conduct a 
workshop with BTK as a part of their continuing engagements to 
convey their key asks regarding fixed access competition, access and 
deployment issues. At the same time, Vodafone Turkey has taken the 
decision to court, and the legal proceedings are ongoing. 
In Tanzania, the NRA (‘TCRA’) completed the market review study to 
update the Interconnection Rates Determination No.5/2017 to 
determine mobile termination rates that expired in December 2022. 
On 14 July 2023, the TCRA published a notice setting a new glidepath 
for MTRs for the next four years to 2027, to be applied retrospectively 
from 1 January 2023. The new glidepath is as follows: TZS 1.86 for 
2023; TZS 1.76 for 2024; TZS 1.68 for 2025; TZS 1.60 for 2026; and 
TZS 1.52 for 2027. The glide-path represents an average decline of 
5% per annum up to 2028.
In Egypt, Vodafone Egypt is in the process of shutting down 3G 
technology by end of 2026. The NRA (‘NTRA’) will define an industry 
3G shutdown roadmap in line with Vodafone Egypt’s own roadmap.

Notes:
1. All: Single (or unpaired) blocks of spectrum are used for asymmetric data (non-voice) use; block quantity has been rounded to the nearest whole number. Most of the radio spectrum in this table is 
organised as paired spectrum - a block of spectrum in a lower frequency band and an associated block of spectrum in an upper frequency band. Where the radio spectrum is specified in the form 
“2x10 MHz” it represents 10 MHz in a lower band and 10 MHz in an upper band. Where this is followed by “+25”, this idicates it is an unpaired, standalone, spectrum.
2. Germany: The allocation of 2.1GHz will change to the following: At present we have 2x15 MHz (2040) and 2x5 (2025); in January 2026 will have 2x20 MHz (2040).
3. Multiple: Blocks within the same spectrum band but with different licence expiry dates are separately identified
4. UK: All UK spectrum licences are perpetual so any dates given are the ones from which licence fees become payable, and where no date is given this means that licence fees already apply.
5. UK: Currently in the transition period of the 3.4-3.8 GHz defragmentation deal with VMO2. Once the transition is completed in 2025, Vodafone will have 90 MHz with an expiry date of 2038.
6. Spain: The initial term of the licence is 20 years, with the option to renew the licence for an additional 20 years as long as the licence conditions have been met.
7. Ireland: 105MHz in cities, 85MHz in regions.
8. Romania: 100 MHz 3.5 GHz licence to start upon expiry of the original 40 MHz licence
9. Czech Republic: Early extension to the 2.1 GHz licence achieved in 2022, extending the term of the original licence from 2025 to 2041
10. Czech Republic: Includes 40 MHz acquired from PODA, with same licence duration as the other 60 MHz
11. Albania: As part of the merger remedies from the ONE-ALBtelecom merger, Vodafone acquirde the following spectrum from the merged entity effective May 1st 2023: 2X4.5 MHz of 1800 MHz 
expiring June 2024; 2X7.2 MHz of 1800 MHz expiring March 2034; 2X5 MHz of 2.1 GHz expiring June 2026; and 2X20 MHz of 2.6 GHz expiring May 2031
12. South Africa: Under South Africa’s licensing regime, Vodacom has been assigned a network and service operating licence. This operating licence permits Vodacom to be assigned spectrum licences 
which are valid for the duration of the operating licence, subject to annual renewal through the payment of annual spectrum usage regulatory fees. Vodacom’s operating licence will expire in 2029.
13. South Africa: South African Regulator has indicated that it has approved Vodacom’s 2100MHz license amendment which effectively returns the 2100TDD spectrum.
14. Lesotho: Vodacom’s Lesotho spectrum licences are attached to a unified services license and renewed annually.
15. Mozambique: 3.5GHz spectrum for 5G trial which was extended to 2024. 2x5 of 2.1GHz and 2x5 of 1800MHz have been acquired for 5 years expirying in 2028. A further 2x2MHz of 900MHz was also 
acquired expiring in line with the overall unified license.
16. Turkey: Extension of 2X11 MHz licence up to April 30, 2029 was completed on April 18, 2023. Licence extension Protocol is subject to Council of State’s opinion which is pending
17. Multiple: We currently hold mmWave 26 GHz licences in Italy, Spain and Greece

by their use of a date in the future or such words as ‘will’, ‘may’, ‘expects’, 
‘believes’, ‘intends’, ‘plans’, ‘further’, ‘ongoing’, ‘anticipates’, ‘could’, or 
‘targets’. By their nature, forward-looking statements are inherently 
predictive, speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they 
relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the 
future There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and 
developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by 
these forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not 
limited to the following:

reduced customer retention, reductions or changes in customer 
spending and increased pricing pressure;
 – the Group’s ability to extend and expand its spectrum resources, to 
support ongoing growth in customer demand for mobile data services;
 – the Group’s ability to secure the timely delivery of high-quality

any future write-downs or impairment charges on the Group’s assets, or

distributable funds and other factors that the Board takes into 
account in determining the level of dividends;
 – the Group’s ability to satisfy working capital requirements;
 – changes in foreign exchange rates;

 – the impact of legal or other proceedings against the Group or other 
companies in the communications industry; and changes in statutory tax 
rates and profit mix, including the disposals of Vodafone Spain and 
Vodafone Italy;
 – climate change projection risk including, for example, the evolution 
of climate change and its impacts, changes in the scientific assessment 
of climate change impacts, transition pathways and future risk 
exposure and limitations of climate scenario forecasts; amendments to 
or new ESG reporting standards, models or methodologies; 
 – changes in ESG data availability and quality which could result in 
revisions to reported data going forward; and climate scenarios and 
the models that analyse them have limitations that are sensitive to 
key assumptions and parameters, which are themselves subject to 
some uncertainty. 
A review of the reasons why actual results and developments may differ 
materially from the expectations disclosed or implied within forward-
looking statements can be found under ‘Principal risk factors and 
uncertainties’ on pages 57 to 62 of this document. All subsequent written 
or oral forward-looking statements attributable to Vodafone or any 
member of the Vodafone Group or any persons acting on their behalf are

assurances can be given that the forward-looking statements in this 
document will be realised. Subject to compliance with applicable law and
