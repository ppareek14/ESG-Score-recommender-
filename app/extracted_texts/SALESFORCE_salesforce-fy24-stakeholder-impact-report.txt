25 Years of Impact
A letter from our CEO, Marc Benioff
Twenty-five years ago, in a small apartment on Telegraph Hill in San Francisco, we launched Salesforce 
with a dream to revolutionize the software industry.
We wanted to bring enterprise software to the cloud — with a new technology model, a new business model 
and a new stakeholder model. And even as we dreamed big, we never imagined Salesforce would become 
what it is today: the world’s #1 AI CRM, the third-largest enterprise software company and the largest 
enterprise applications company in the world.
This is the amazing progress we celebrate as we mark 25 years of Salesforce.
At the same time, fiscal year 2024 was an extraordinary year of transformation, thanks to the next generation 
of artificial intelligence. This could be the single most important moment in the history of our industry, and 
customers are turning to us to help them navigate this AI revolution and connect with their customers in a 
whole new way.
I’m especially proud that we’re achieving this incredible success by staying true to our values: trust, customer 
success, innovation, equality and sustainability. Our values have remained our North Star, creating shared 
success with all of our stakeholders and multiplying the impact of our 1-1-1 philanthropic model beyond 
what we could've ever envisioned.
To date, we’ve given more than $700 million in grants and performed over 8.7 million hours of volunteer 
service by our employees. We’re honored to help more than 56,000 nonprofits and higher-ed institutions 
power their missions with our technology, and inspired that nearly 20,000 companies have adopted our  
1-1-1 model to make their own impact.
Building responsible technology
In fiscal year 2024, we set out to make our AI products the most trusted in the industry. Led by the Office of 
Ethical and Humane Use, we focused on creating 
 and 
 to ensure responsible 
development and deployment of AI products in the enterprise. We introduced the 
, which 
lets customers benefit from generative AI without compromising their data security and privacy controls.
Salesforce is also proactively engaging with governments, industry, academia, and civil society to advance 
responsible, risk-based, and globally applicable AI norms. This includes advising the White House on 
responsible AI policies and signing the 
 to help advance the development of 
safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.

Creating an equitable, sustainable future
We've made progress on our equality commitments and have set new representation goals through fiscal year 
2031 in our efforts to create a workplace that mirrors our society. And, we continue to be committed to equal 
pay for equal work.  
We also continued our efforts to build a safer, more equal, and sustainable future. With the rise of generative AI, 
we are actively working to integrate sustainability, one of our key principles for

our 
.   
This year, we pioneered a first-of-its-kind long-term 
 to support new, impactful 
projects across Brazil, India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia that advance a just and inclusive energy 
transition. We are also more than half-way to our goal of funding the conservation, restoration and growth of 
100 million trees — with 52 million trees to date.   
Supporting our communities
In fiscal year 2024, we celebrated a decade of Salesforce’s strong support for public education. Globally, we've 
given over $190 million in education grants to provide students and young adults with STEM access and career-
aligned learning opportunities preparing them with skills for careers of the future.  
Salesforce also launched the 
 to provide nonprofit organizations 
with equitable access to trusted generative AI technologies. Leveraging our 1-1-1 model, Salesforce committed 
$2 million in unrestricted grant funding, pro bono expertise, and technology donations in fiscal year 2024 to 
support 
 in developing innovative AI solutions on Salesforce.  
Today, we are proud that more than 6 million Trailblazers around the world have used Trailhead, our free online 
learning platform, to upskill and meet the growing demand for digital talent.  
And to support our global communities in moments of crisis, Salesforce and its employees raised more than  
$2 million to help humanitarian nonprofits’ relief efforts for disasters like the Turkey-Syria earthquakes and 
the Maui wildfires.   
Thank you for your continued partnership and support. We’re so excited  
for what’s ahead and to be on this journey with all of you.
 
With gratitude,

Commitment to 
Transparency
At Salesforce, our focus on ESG excellence guides us to be an ethical, resilient company and 
deliver value to our stakeholders in both the short- and long-term. Our core values of trust, 
customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability guide us and we strive to provide 
transparent and meaningful disclosures to our stakeholders.
Transparency is a key pillar of our commitment to ESG excellence. We believe that 
comparable, consistent, decision-useful, and verified ESG disclosure is critical to 
understanding the long-term health and resilience of a business. This disclosure includes 
topics that impact our day-to-day business, as well as topics in which Salesforce impacts 
society and the environment.
We have a long history of voluntary disclosure, beginning with our first Stakeholder 
Impact Report in FY12. While this report is intended to be a comprehensive summary 
of our ESG and impact efforts and initiatives; we also publish topic-specific 
information, policies and other disclosures which can be found in the ESG Metrics & 
Indicators section of this report as well as on our Impact at Salesforce webpage.
We’re optimistic about the regulatory momentum around ESG reporting from the 
convergence of existing standard-setting organizations into the International Sustainability 
Standards Board to attention from regulators across the globe. We continue to use our voice 
to advocate for initiatives that push closer to global standards and encourage other 
companies to do so also. We also recognize that ESG disclosure is rapidly evolving, and we 
continue to evaluate and mature along with the industry.

Achieving a 1.5°C future requires systemic decarbonization across industries and organizations. Our full value 
chain extends our own operations and is deeply interconnected with the world’s emissions, from the electric grids 
powering our data centers to our diverse network of suppliers. 
We’re not alone in this. According to a recent 
, most companies are struggling to meet their own 
net zero targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions — with only 7% on track. That’s why our work goes beyond the four 
walls of Salesforce: to reach net zero goals we need to bring our customers, suppliers, peers, governments, and all 
other stakeholders along on the journey.

Market-based vs Location-based Methodologies
We quantify our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using two different methodologies: market-based  
and location-based. The market-based methodology allows companies to reduce the emissions they report  
from their electricity use by sourcing renewable energy certificates. If done well, buying renewable power 
and related certificates 
 to drive power sector decarbonization. However, it does 
not meaningfully reduce the emissions from a company's electricity use. The location-based methodology is  
a more accurate measure of the actual emissions which result from our use of electricity. Both methodologies 
can be valuable indicators, which is why we measure and report our progress using both. We hope all  
companies will do the same.

Our Absolute Emissions Trajectory
Along with setting science-based targets, we know that even deeper absolute emissions reductions are needed. 
So, we’ve also set a more ambitious climate goal: to reduce absolute, location-based emissions (without any 
compensation like renewables or carbon credit purchases) by 50% by FY31, and 90% by FY41 across our  
entire value chain (scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions).
50%
reduction in absolute emissions by FY31 
relative to FY19 Baseline

Our latest absolute location-based emissions trajectory from FY19–FY24, as well as the forecasted emissions 
range from FY25–FY31, is shown below: 
Location-Based GHG Emissions 
(tCO2e)
Our FY24 emissions increased compared to the previous year, both from a location-based (3%) and market-
based (4%) perspective. Although there was a 7% emissions intensity decline when considering company 
growth, we know that absolute, location-based emissions reductions are needed for a sustainable future. Our 
forecasted emissions are shown here as a range representing the extent of modeled scenarios. Achieving the 
1.5°C goal of reducing FY31 emissions by 50% (relative to FY19) will require significant action from Salesforce as 
well as governments, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders.
1.5ºC-aligned 50% 
reduction goal
As outlined in our 
, we organize our value chain emissions in four categories that reflect 
our key business operations: Infrastructure, Suppliers, Business Travel, and Global Campus. We have 
found that this alignment maximizes the efficiency of our emissions reduction work, ensuring we are 
moving together on the path to a collective 50% reduction by FY31.
Climate Action Plan
Infrastructure
Salesforce products run on cloud infrastructure, including leased data center space in shared “colocation” facilities 
and 
, our public cloud platform. Central to our core business, this category comprises most of our 
emissions. To reduce emissions, we focus on increasing operational efficiency while collaborating with our public 
cloud suppliers and our customers to optimize our deployment.
Hyperforce
Hyperforce
Hyperforce is Salesforce’s next generation infrastructure architecture built for the public cloud, delivering the 
Salesforce platform and applications rapidly, reliably, and sustainably. Because Hyperforce runs on third-party 
public cloud infrastructure, our greatest opportunity involves reducing the impact of software architecture and 
code, while working with our cloud partners to increase their climate action.
In FY24, we collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to perform a 
 of 
Hyperforce. While the review uncovered several key areas to focus our emissions reduction efforts, it also 
highlighted ways in which Hyperforce actively guides customers towards the cleanest-energy data centers 
possible. For example, European customers, when not specifying a preferred country, are automatically directed 
to data centers in Sweden, where they are powered by electricity that produces 93% less carbon than the global 
average. It's not just about reducing our carbon footprint; it's about empowering our customers to do the same.

In FY24, we assembled a cross-functional team of experts from engineering, product, and customer success that

Supplier Sustainability
With more than 80% of our FY24 greenhouse gas emissions coming from our supply chain, our suppliers’ own 
climate progress is critical to meeting our emissions reduction goals. Through our 
 program, 
we’re strategically engaging with our suppliers and elevating sustainability in our purchasing decisions to 
accelerate global climate action progress. 
Supplier Sustainability
As part of the mission to decarbonize our value chain, we expect our suppliers to set SBTs to reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions. We've made a commitment that by the end of FY25, suppliers representing 60% of 
our applicable scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions will set their own SBTs. As of the end of FY24, suppliers that 
have set SBTs comprised 25% of our applicable scope 3 emissions, and suppliers with commitments to set SBTs 
comprised an additional 14%. We still have a large gap to close and will work diligently to empower suppliers 
with the tools and resources to set and progress towards SBTs.
We also aim to fully integrate sustainability into our procurement strategies, operations, and decision-making. We 
have established a formal framework for evaluating suppliers’ performance, which we use to inform supplier 
selection and to include sustainability as a KPI in strategic supplier business reviews. We communicate our 
expectations through our 
and a comprehensive Supplier Sustainability program guide.

Supplier Commitments
A key way we’re driving this action is by directly embedding specific, binding climate obligations into our supplier 
agreements with the 
, a set of sustainability-related contract provisions. The 
Exhibit can require suppliers to set SBTs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase sustainability disclosures, and 
deliver carbon-neutral products and services – all as part of their contractual obligations to Salesforce. In FY24, 
46% of Salesforce’s spend under management was with suppliers that have signed a Sustainability Exhibit with 
Salesforce. Tying Salesforce 
 to increasing spend with suppliers that have signed the 
Exhibit has been critical to its success. With clear support from leadership that sustainability is a priority, our 
teams have been able to add the Sustainability Exhibit not just to new contracts, but also as an amendment to 
existing contracts with many of our highest-impact suppliers.

Suppliers tell us that Salesforce’s clear call to action has been instrumental in 
making the business case for their own climate strategy, and pushed them to move 
forward with climate initiatives they weren’t yet pursuing, such as setting SBTs.

Incorporating Data Provided by Suppliers
In FY24, we enhanced our efforts to include supplier emissions data in our GHG inventory. Previously, like most 
companies, we estimated supplier emissions using an industry-average emissions factor multiplied by our 
spending in that industry. However, this approach fails to differentiate between suppliers and assumes a direct 
correlation between spending and emissions. This may not be the case, especially when the more sustainable 
option from a supplier comes at a financial premium. In other words, spending a bit more for the more carbon-
friendly option isn’t reflected in our GHG inventory using this approach, but instead is calculated as higher 
emissions.
To that end, we took on the goal of establishing a methodology that allows us to incorporate more accurate 
carbon data from our top suppliers into our GHG inventory. Furthermore, we're collaborating with our suppliers to 
streamline data collection. This includes taking part in the 
 program, where suppliers can 
disclose their data to multiple customers and investors through a single platform. We’re excited to announce that 
we have successfully developed the new methodology, which evaluates supplier-provided data for increased 
accuracy compared to spend-based data. In FY24, we integrated supplier-provided data for 45% of our supplier 
emissions, resulting in a 13% adjustment to these emissions compared to using the spend-based approach.

Business Travel
In FY24, our business travel emissions increased by 68% from the previous year.[1] We believe several factors 
drove this steep increase in emissions. First, the 
 emission factors used to calculate emissions underwent the 
largest single-year adjustment we've seen in five years. Second, the number of flights our employees took 
increased by 32% compared to the previous year. It’s clear that we need to do more to reduce emissions from 
travel. We’ll get there by being even more intentional about when and how we travel, following guidelines to 
reduce unnecessary trips, and prioritizing low-carbon transportation options whenever possible. We’re also 
building greater accountability for our environmental goals, including a travel sustainability metric in our 
 program.
Defra

Enabling Sustainable Travel Choices
We aim to support our employees with sustainable travel options that are easy and efficient. As a first step, we’ve 
incorporated guidance into our travel policy to consider the planet when making travel decisions. Our online 
booking tool now suggests switching to more sustainable modes of transportation whenever there are viable 
alternatives to air travel. And, we’ve expanded our relationships with rail and ground transportation suppliers that 
provide more sustainable options. We also require all employees to review an internal Trailhead module on making 
sustainable travel choices prior to booking business travel. 
Decarbonizing the Sector
Recognizing that some degree of air travel will continue to be an essential part of doing business, we are working 
with our peers, partners, and customers to find ways to deeply decarbonize the sector and understand the 
opportunities and implications for buyers like Salesforce.
As a member of the 
 (FMC), Salesforce has committed to replacing 5% of our annual 
conventional jet fuel demand with low- or no-carbon-emission alternatives starting in FY31. This initiative not only 
aligns with our goal to achieve widespread decarbonization but also supports innovators working on technologies 
to make it happen.

Decarbonizing Our Offices
In FY24, we continued on our office decarbonization journey by studying opportunities for energy efficiency and 
electrification in the long-term plan for our real estate portfolio. We developed tools that aligned incentives, 
prioritized these opportunities, and publicized resources to help others along their journey. We conducted five 
energy audits and are actively implementing energy conservation measures that were uncovered. Additionally, we 
installed energy meters on several sites to increase our access to primary data to better inform our reporting and 
quantification of reduction efforts.
This year, we developed a program-specific action plan to address climate issues specific to our Global Campus. 
The plan involves getting input and cooperation from various teams in our real estate program, tapping into their 
workflows to embed emissions reduction efforts, and empowering team members to be part of the solution. We 
developed a comprehensive tool to track Global Campus actual emissions, predict emissions, and forecast 
scenarios to help us plan and make better decisions.

Sustainable Buildings and Materials
We’re proud to mark a new era of eco-positive buildings as we introduce three new sustainable offices in Chicago, 
Dublin, and Sydney. We leveraged deep partnerships with project teams at these locations to pursue ambitious 
sustainability and wellness goals, including:
Another important focus this year was expanding our knowledge of the carbon footprint of building materials. We 
conducted an assessment to calculate the embodied carbon of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP), 
information technology (IT), audio-visual (AV), and security systems. This complements our existing assessments 
for furniture and construction materials. Besides helping with our corporate reporting, this assessment sheds light 
on the environmental impact of materials that typically lack easily accessible carbon data, unlike other material 
types. In turn, it also provides opportunities for us to educate and collaborate with manufacturers to move to 
market in a positive direction.

Commute and Home Emissions
Given the realities of a hybrid work environment, it has been critical for us to consider employee commute and 
home office emissions. In FY23, we analyzed our commute emissions by mode and office location and evaluated 
transportation demand management strategies. We also implemented training, events, and enablement focused 
on equipping our employees with the information and resources to support low- and zero-emission commute 
choices while continuing to promote

sustainable home office resources
We continued to look at how employees get to work and where our offices are located. To make it easier for 
employees to get around, we expanded our Bay Area shuttle program, adding routes and stops. In our offices, we 
put together Commuter Guides for each location that connects employees to eco-friendly local transportation 
options. We also organize global commute-incentive competitions to encourage carpooling, cycling, and taking 
public transportation. To address home office emissions, we conducted a company-wide survey to better 
understand how much energy is being used – and how to reduce that consumption.

CASE STUDY
Pioneering a Global 
Energy Transition
In FY24, Salesforce pioneered a first-of-its-kind long-term 
purchase to help scale new, high-impact projects across 
the Global South that advance a just and inclusive energy 
transition. Teaming up with Powertrust, a global 
aggregator of high-impact renewable energy projects 
around the world, Salesforce committed to leveraging D-
RECs. Aligned with the International REC (I-REC) 
Standard, this innovative financial mechanism empowers 
organizations to support small-scale, renewable 
projects worldwide.
Today, more than 774 million people lack access to basic 
electricity, while an additional 2.4 billion lack access to 
modern energy services. Distributed renewable energy 
projects offer a lifeline, providing essential electricity 
access while curbing emissions. However, these 
opportunities have been largely overlooked by 
corporates. Salesforce's investment in D-RECs aims to 
model a replicable corporate procurement strategy that 
drives clean energy growth in underserved markets and 
fosters social and environmental progress.
Empowering Rural Enterprises in India
Spanning more than 250 sites representing a cumulative capacity of around 3.5MW, these initiatives target 
micro and small enterprises in India grappling with limited grid access or dependence on diesel generators. 
Each solar system, ranging from approximately 10 to 25 kW,  will energize village industries such as sewing, 
grain processing, milk chilling, and rice hulling. The revenue generated from D-RECs will help expedite loan 
repayment and facilitate ongoing operational and maintenance support to ensure that these systems bring 
long-term functionality.

Project in Pakistan. This investment isn’t just about meeting a target – it’s about pioneering the 
emerging blue carbon market. Spanning an impressive 328,000 hectares of mangroves, this is the 
largest blue carbon project in the world. By protecting and restoring mangrove ecosystems, this project 
is not only supporting our planet's natural treasures but also uplifting communities. In fact, it could 
benefit over 40,000 people most vulnerable to climate and economic threats. Our investment doesn’t 
stop there: the revenue generated from carbon credits is channeled towards supporting improved 
health and education infrastructure, gender equality, clean drinking water, clean energy development, 
sustainable livelihoods, and more.

dedicated to de-risking investment in climate technology and bolstering innovation ecosystems, with a  
focus on serving underrepresented communities and regions, particularly in the Global South. These  
organizations included:
New Energy Nexus (NEX):
Empowering diverse clean energy entrepreneurs globally, NEX envisions 100% clean energy for 100% of the 
population. Salesforce’s contribution will help NEX reach its target of assisting 100,000 clean energy innovators by

Climate Policy Advocacy
The urgency for decisive climate policy is greater than ever before. This year’s 
 report found 
significant shortfalls across nearly every meaningful indicator. Achieving a global shift to a net zero and nature 
positive future demands a major acceleration in climate action, more than any individual, company, country can 
achieve alone.

 to advocating for science-based climate policies that facilitate a just and equitable 
global transition to a 1.5°C future. Our voice and our influence are powerful tools to drive change. We’ve solidified

Despite all the progress we’re seeing, we acknowledge the vast work ahead. Effecting systemic change is difficult, 
especially at scale. But waiting to take action will only increase the urgency and difficulty. Now more than ever, 
every business, every individual, and every community must unite, step up, and use their voices to take on  
climate change.  

People
Over the past 25 years, Salesforce has become a best place 
to work, and a destination for employees to build 
meaningful careers. Guided by our core values, we use our 
technology and AI-powered tools to increase employee 
engagement and productivity. We live our value of equality 
by building a workplace that reflects the communities 
around us and championing initiatives that drive equity 
within our company, ecosystem, and society.

Championing Equality
Equality is a core value at Salesforce. We live this value by fostering a more inclusive workplace and advancing 
greater equality in society. We remain focused on accelerating equality within our organization, across the 
Salesforce ecosystem, and in our communities around the world.
Advancing Representation
Over the years, we’ve learned that it takes time and a deliberate approach to build a workplace that is representative of
the communities around us. We’re proud of the
 toward the public U.S. and global representation 
goals we set in FY21, and we have more work to do. 
In FY21, we set representation goals of increasing the number of U.S. employees from underrepresented groups to 
50% and to double representation of Black leaders in the U.S. We achieved these goals ahead of schedule.  
We also set goals to increase URM[1] representation among U.S. leaders and U.S. employees overall, both by 50%. We 
did not achieve those goals. Although we haven’t seen the progress we would like, we are deeply committed to a 
holistic approach to hiring, retaining, and improving the experiences of our underrepresented talent. Our Office of 
Equality works directly with our diversity recruiting team to ensure our strategies for bringing in underrepresented 
talent continuously moves us forward.
Looking ahead in our equality journey, we’ve set new representation goals through FY31 to help drive alignment, 
transparency, and accountability in our efforts to create a workplace that mirrors our society. We will continue to assess
these goals each year and evaluate where we can accelerate this work. We will focus on enhancing representation 
among all employees and in leadership roles, specifically for women and non-binary individuals globally, as well as  
URM populations in the United States. We’ve also broadened our previously announced 
.
progress we’ve made
gender goal
We are empowering leaders across the organization to own this work by sharing aggregated and anonymous 
representation data and embedding representation goals in their annual business plans. We also have a renewed 
focus on retention programs that support, retain, and cultivate underrepresented talent globally.

Equality Groups
Our 13 
 aim to amplify inclusion, accelerate business success, and incubate innovation. These  
global, employee-led groups are sponsored by Salesforce’s Office of Equality and supported by individual 
contributors, managers, and our most senior executive leaders. This year, we implemented a new program to 
ensure each of these 13 groups has global executive sponsors and advisors for strategic guidance and mentorship. 
These groups foster community, while ensuring our systems, and platforms are accessible to all. 
Between all 13 Global Equality Groups, there are approximately 270 local chapters, over 1,200 employee leaders,  
and a total program membership of over 45,000 workers — more than half of our workforce.
Equality Groups
Racial Equality and Justice
In FY21, we became more intentional about our racial equality efforts and created a new framework 
focusing on four key pillars: People, Purchasing, Philanthropy, and Policy. In addition to our own 
representation commitments, we set ambitious Philanthropy goals to invest $200 million and contribute 
1 million employee volunteer hours toward advancing racial equality and justice by FY26. We've made 
significant progress, with over $181 million donated and more than 797,000 employee volunteer hours 
contributed as of FY24. 
We’re proud to have exceeded our Purchasing goals of $100 million to Black-owned businesses and $100 
million to minority founders. We’ve invested $195 million in Black and URM-led founders. And, we've also 
spent more than $250 million with Black-owned businesses and increased spending with minority-owned 
businesses by more than 25% over the past three years. Over the past two years, we’ve also provided 
hands-on support for 50 Black-owned businesses, by way of mentorship and sponsorship programs that 
are specifically focused on business development. We're gearing up for the launch of a new initiative in 
FY25 — a mentorship and sponsorship program specifically tailored to support Latinx-owned businesses.
On the Policy front, our Government Affairs team has continued supporting legislation reform to 
champion equality. In the U.S., we championed the Respect for Marriage Act, advocating for voting 
rights, and paid family leave. We continue to broaden our global reach and the focus of our equality 
strategy. For example, in Australia we launched a Reconciliation Action plan, aimed at amplifying support 
for Aboriginal and Islander Peoples. We also expanded our civic engagement program into international 
markets, reinforcing our pledge to advocate for equitable and inclusive policies across borders.
Inclusive Employee Experience
In addition to our Equality Groups, we provide resources to ensure our employees from all backgrounds are supported. 
For example, the Warmline is an internal program that connects employees with advocates to help navigate pivotal 
career moments and conversations. In FY24, the Warmline was named a 
  
by the World Economic Forum for its impact in enhancing the experiences of underrepresented groups at Salesforce.
We also prioritize leadership development with programs focused on career navigation, sponsorship, and mentorship 
for women and URM leaders. In FY24, to cultivate executive talent from underrepresented groups in Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa (EMEA) and the U.S., we launched partnerships with organizations like 
 
, 
, The Powerlist U.K. Black Excellence Awards, and  
UNCF Atlanta Mayor's Masked Ball. 
Our commitment to supporting underrepresented talent extends to job candidates as well. The Insiders Program, which 
connects candidates with Salesforce employees from diverse backgrounds, facilitated over 2,000 connections in FY24.

Gender Equality
Last year, we also continued advancing gender equality globally with new commitments during the UN  
General Assembly to advance equal pay and support greater women's representation and equity in  
technology, science, and financing. 
We also aim to enhance diversity in our talent community and advance our representation goals through events.

we took steps to amplify community impact through development initiatives that empower diverse-
owned businesses.

Creating Talent 
Opportunities
At Salesforce, we acknowledge that talent is everywhere, but opportunity is not. At a time when there’s increasing 
demand for diverse and skilled talent, many young people entering the workforce lack access to opportunities  
for employment.
Our 
 programs aim to address this by offering internships, apprenticeships, and work experience 
events at Salesforce. We focus on engaging untapped talent, including young people from underserved and 
underrepresented communities who may not be aware of or lack access to the career possibilities available.
Future Pathways
As transformative technologies like AI reshape the workforce, the Future Pathways programs expose talent to 
these technologies through workshops and training opportunities. 
Since FY10, we’ve supported more than 1,200 diverse and ambitious young professionals in launching their 
careers with Salesforce through our Future Pathways programs. And last year, more than 500 young adults  
from underrepresented backgrounds and/or non traditional pathways have engaged with Salesforce Future 
Pathways Program.
Internships and Apprenticeships
In the United States, we partner with
 and 
 to offer internships. Through Year Up, 
young adults between 18 and 29 complete technical and professional training in areas such as IT, Business 
Operations, and Sales Data Analytics, followed by a work-based experience, such as an internship at Salesforce. 
Similarly, our partnership with Ada Developers Academy manifests in an immersive program that prepares women 
and gender-expansive people for careers in software development, culminating in an internship.

overlooked in traditional recruitment processes. For example, we hosted 120 future leaders involved in Year Up 
and COOP at the Salesforce Tower San Francisco for the 4th Annual Future Executive Summit. Each attendee of 
the summit was added to our internal talent pipeline for future Salesforce opportunities. We also welcomed more

Employees must be well to do well, and we recognize the health and wellbeing of our employees and their families is essential 
to our success. We’re committed to offering benefits that help our employees care for themselves and their loved ones. 
Setting Employees Up for Success
We are committed to setting employees up for success from day one and helping them learn, grow, and develop throughout 
their journey with us.
This year, we reintroduced in-person onboarding in North America, Europe, and India – with outstanding results. Ninety-six 
percent of new hires who attended onboarding in-person felt inspired to get involved in our culture, and 97% of them would 
recommend Salesforce as a great place to work. 
Driving Employee Engagement 
and Productivity
In FY24, we took steps to actively boost employee engagement and productivity as we focus on driving high performance 
culture across the company. We introduced a new performance evaluation approach, anchored on clarity of expectations, 
differentiation, and equality, that is enabling us to more closely tie employee performance with compensation planning. We 
also continued our investment in mentorship, coaching, and learning offerings.
We also delivered nearly 1,000 learning programs for additional skill-building, engaging over 18,000 attendees across all levels. 
These programs covered a wide range of topics, including communication skills, trust-building, business simulations, equality 
and diversity, and emotional intelligence.

Benefits in Response to Employee Needs
Listening is a big part of our culture at Salesforce –  that’s why we invited our employees to share what benefits 
matter most to them in our biennial Global Benefits Survey. This survey helps us continue to shape our benefits 
and build on key programming areas that matter to employees: physical health, mental wellbeing, family care, and 
financial resources.
At the heart of these key focus areas are “

families need, including healthcare, mental health support and resources, life and disability coverage, retirement, 
time off, and more. These benefits empower our employees and their families to:

Enhancing Employee Mental Health
To support employee mental health, we developed and launched a mental health training curriculum for 
managers. This training helps our leaders manage their team's mental health and foster a psychologically  
safe work environment. We also offer resources, including mental health first aid, to directly impact 
employee's mental health.
Building Resilience and Productivity
with Employee Care Programs
Through our CAREforce program, we support employees impacted by hardship, natural disasters, and 
complex humanitarian events, extreme weather-related events, and more. This includes immediate 
assistance for disasters or incidents and long term recovery support. Additionally, the CAREforce Hardship 
Relief Fund, a 501(c)(3) charitable donation program, supported employees experiencing sudden, 
overwhelming, and unexpected impacts.
Not only are these programs crucial for our employees’ recovery from hardships, they’re also critically valuable 
to our performance as a business. Seventy-six percent of CAREforce supported employees were able to 
maintain productivity despite their circumstances. 
We also provided training and events to build resilience and improve health and safety knowledge, including 
emergency preparedness, personal safety training, and emergency exercises. Many of these training sessions 
were conducted in partnership with our business resource groups and strategic partners, enabling our team to 
create specialized safety resources tailored to the unique needs of each community. This year, Salesforce 
trained 98% of employees on health and safety topics through Trailhead.

demands that companies explore a variety of financial instruments. While still early in its journey, 
Salesforce’s climate finance strategy includes a mix of instruments, such as: philanthropy, venture 
capital, carbon credit purchasing and commitments, distributed renewable energy certificates 
and Virtual Power Purchase Agreements, as well as a sustainability bond.
Salesforce partnered with Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) to release a Corporate Climate Finance 
Playbook, sharing our learnings. The playbook serves as a guide for companies to understand

Looking ahead to FY25, Salesforce will continue advocating for the U.S. Congress to pass comprehensive privacy 
legislation – laws that build on and are interoperable with existing global privacy standards. We stand ready to 
support a U.S. privacy law that prioritizes people’s rights, builds trust in the technology industry, and strengthens

CASE STUDY
Building the Most Trusted AI Products
In FY24, we set out to make our AI products the most 
ethical and trusted in the industry. Led by the Office of 
Ethical and Humane Use, this initiative focused on 
launching generative AI solutions (GAI) across our 
products. We refined our guidelines for responsible 
generative AI and updated our AI Acceptable Use Policy 
(AUP) to reflect these developments. Working closely 
with product teams, we prioritized AI safety measures 
such as the Trust Layer, model testing, and detection of 
bias and toxicity to advance ethical AI. 
Trusted AI must be a collaborative effort. We believe in 
partnering strategically to drive progress in the 
technology industry and society. Office of Ethical and 
Humane Use team members represent Salesforce on 
various ethical AI councils worldwide, as well as with the 
World Economic Forum’s Steering Committee for the 
Responsible Use of Technology. We hold positions in the 
U.S. National AI Advisory Committee, the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce Commission on Artificial Intelligence 
Competitiveness, Inclusion, and Innovation, the 
Singaporean Ethical AI Advisory Council, and the U.S. 
National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
Launching ethical AI products also means 
ensuring accessibility for all users. Through a
partnership with our Product Accessibility and 
Inclusive Design team, every Cloud product 
group took action on critical issues, improving 
product quality and limiting tech debt, while 
ensuring Salesforce cloud products are accessible 
to users with disabilities.
As we mark a decade of investing in ethical AI, 
our opportunities extend to the highest levels of 
public service. In October 2023, Salesforce 
signed onto the voluntary White House AI Safety 
commitments. We’re committed to continue 
working with governments, business leaders, the 
scientific community, academics, and citizens, 
drawing on their expertise and frameworks to 
ensure ethical AI development.
With generative AI being a nascent technology, widely accepted 
standards aren’t yet adopted. We recognize this gap, and we’ve 
taken steps to establish internal decision-making processes and 
standards. To address pressing trust challenges, we've also 
established an internal AI Trust Council for AI-specific decision-
making in addition to our broader Ethical Use Advisory Council.

Ethical Use Policy
We recognize it’s not enough to simply build ethics and trust into our products. We also have a 
responsibility to understand how our products are used and the direct impacts of our technologies in 
the world. This understanding is foundational to our ability to create ethical use policies that 
guarantee the responsible use of our products and services, aligning with our commitment to 
fostering trust with our customers and users. Many of these policies can be found embedded in 
Salesforce’s publicly available 
, as well as our 
, published 
in FY24 to specifically address customer use of AI, including Generative AI.

Product Accessibility and 
Inclusive Design
At Salesforce, we strive to create products and features that cater to the diverse abilities of everyone. This 
means more than just accommodating users with permanent disabilities – we also consider temporary or 
situational challenges individuals might face in the various environments where our technology is used.
By building products that not only meet predefined technical standards like WCAG and Section 508, 
, we empower customer success and foster inclusivity for everyone.
but 
also meet a broader range of user needs
Inclusive design is core to how we build better, more usable products. By including individuals with 
disabilities throughout our development process, we highlight voices that are often overlooked in 
traditional design approaches, thereby driving innovation. These individuals, with their unique problem-
solving perspectives, help us understand diverse user experiences, increase product adoption, and uncover 
technology solutions that benefit everyone. 
This year, our Product Accessibility and Inclusive Design team upgraded our Salesforce Automated 
Accessibility Testing tooling (Sa11y). This tool detects issues in code before deployment, requiring minimal 
effort from developers. With Sa11y now checking for 60+ accessibility rules, we increased the automated 
accessibility test coverage from 17% to 80%, preventing around 1,000 bugs.

Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews our ESG initiatives and our Audit and 
Finance Committee oversees disclosures, including ESG disclosures. Our Compensation Committee oversees 
compensation matters for our employees and management, including variable pay tied to ESG performance.  
Being the #1 AI CRM requires strong oversight of privacy, security and ethics. Our Board of Directors’ Privacy, 
Cybersecurity and Ethical Use Committee closely monitors these areas. Trust, our number one value, remains 
paramount in all we do. 
Corporate Governance
Salesforce is committed to managing our affairs consistent with the highest principles of business ethics and 
corporate governance requirements of federal law and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Here are some ways 
we do this:
A majority of our board members are independent of Salesforce. 
The key committees of our board, like Audit and Finance, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee, are all overseen by independent members.
All employees, officers, and directors must adhere to our 
.
Code of Conduct
The roles and responsibilities of our board committees are clearly spelled out in board charters.
When considering appointments to our Board of Directors, Salesforce considers many dimensions of diversity 
including, but not limited to, diversity of gender, race and ethnicity, perspective, professional experience, 
background, and skill set. In FY24, we appointed three new independent directors to serve on our board of 
directors:
Sachin Mehra
Mastercard
Chief Financial Officer
G. Mason Morfit
ValueAct Capital
Co-Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Investment Officer
Executive Compensation Tied to ESG Goals
To strengthen accountability and accelerate 
progress in our ESG initiatives, Salesforce has, 
for the second year in row, included ESG goals 
into incentive compensation plans for our 
Executive Vice Presidents and above.
In FY24, 10% of the target cash incentive opportunity for 
EVP+, as part of the annual bonus plan or individual 
commission plan, is tied to achieving quantified ESG 
measures. These measures include two equality measures 
and two sustainability measures, each weighted equally. 
ESG Oversight
We’ve learned from experience that companies with robust 
ESG programs are better able to navigate multiple crises 
and the increasing complexity of business. 
Recent developments, including the SEC’s climate 
disclosure requirements and the European Union's 
adoption of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive 
(CSRD), signal a new era in ESG accountability.
To operationalize ESG at Salesforce, we have both top-
down commitment from the board and executive 
leadership and bottom-up engagement from employees.

We review the performance of suppliers based on their risk to the company, as assessed by cross-functional 
stakeholders. Suppliers are expected to communicate the principles in the Supplier Code to their employees and 
third-party partners through training, policy, and other communications. To maintain awareness of the Supplier

About This Report
The contents of this report are guided by regular ESG materiality assessments, which 
identify the topics most important to our stakeholders and to our success as a business. We 
also look to leading ESG disclosure frameworks and standards, such as 
(SASB) Software and IT Services sector guide, the 
 (TCFD), the 
 (GRI), the 
 (SDGs) and others in guiding our reporting.
Unless otherwise noted, this report covers Salesforce’s global operations, commitments, 
and practices during FY24 (February 1, 2023 – January 31, 2024). This report also contains 
figures that have been approximated or rounded, and certain reclassifications of data from 
prior public disclosures may have been made to reflect the current period presentation. All 
currency is in U.S. dollars.
We believe building trust with our stakeholders includes a credible ESG reporting process 
that will deliver actionable, transparent, consistent, re-performable, and verifiable metrics. 
Since FY18, we have engaged Ernst & Young LLP (EY), an independent third party, to provide 
a limited assurance review over selected ESG data presented in the ESG Metrics & 
Indicators section of this report.
This report is reviewed by our Legal and ESG Controllership teams to ensure it is consistent 
with our other SEC filings and that data contained in the report can be traced back to 
internal or external records.

ESG Materiality
We conducted our most recent “double materiality” assessment in FY22, a regularly 
conducted exercise to prioritize ESG topics based on their impact to enterprise value 
and our impact on the environment and society. Our process is outlined below:
Topic Identification
We identified relevant topics across Salesforce’s 
value chain through a comprehensive review of 
internal and external data sources.
Stakeholder Engagement
We refined our list of identified topics through 
engagement with internal stakeholders as well as 
external stakeholders familiar with or impacted by 
our business.
Scoring and Evaluation
We scored each data source and stakeholder 
group to determine the highest-impact topics for 
Salesforce. Scoring was provided on two 
dimensions: impacts by ESG topics on the 
business, and the business’ impacts to society and 
the environment. Results were then validated with 
our internal ESG Disclosure Steering Committee.
Results
15 topics were identified as both relevant to Salesforce and validate the alignment of our current strategic ESG 
priorities with stakeholder expectations. These issues are interconnected, and impact to one can have significant 
impact on others. The topics are presented in alphabetical order. Across both materiality dimensions (impact to 
the environment and society and impact to enterprise value), six issues were consistently prioritized by our 
stakeholders, as indicated in bold text:
Environmental
Climate Change & Energy Use
Sustainable Real Estate
Waste & Use of Resources
Water Management

WASTE AND USE OF RESOURCES
Waste management practices
As a software technology company, our operational waste footprint is relatively small. We provide recycling and compost collection where local infrastructure allows for 
these services and we go to great lengths to reduce single-use plastic and food waste by offering reusable dishware, cups and cutlery, bulk snack options, and employee 
fridges for storing leftovers from catered meetings. We periodically engage in employee-facing education campaigns on proper waste sorting and waste reduction best 
practices. Our electronic waste is handled by third-party recycling vendors to ensure we are able to responsibly and securely resell or recycle as much of our hardware 
and peripheral equipment as possible. Our local workplace services teams partner with community non-profits to donate furniture, fixtures, and equipment from our 
offices whenever feasible to avoid unnecessary landfill. We try to limit our footprint at our events through a variety of practices. When planning menus, we save both 
water and emissions by eliminating beef, pork, and almonds, and we serve meals in compostable packaging. When developing signage and branding, we prioritize 
sustainable and recyclable materials, and also plan ahead for reusability. We have increasingly minimized swag to avoid items ending up in the landfill and we work to 
inspire our community by featuring top-quality sustainability content that helps turn commitment into action.

Description of systems for managing global workforce and risk prevention
With a highly-distributed global workforce, we are able to deliver the highest levels of performance, availability, and security. Leveraging our 
own technology and other tools, we can coordinate, collaborate, and create effectively across borders. We recognize the diversity in our global 
workforce, and ensure we create a strong corporate culture based on our core values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and 
sustainability. We operationalize these values through specific measurable actions around accountability, alignment, transparency, integrity, 
and experience. Our employee code of conduct, goal planning process, employee surveys, town halls, workforce analytics initiatives, and 
more allow us to manage and measure our culture and workforce, at scale, while developing local talent pools and reducing risks related to 
visa controls, relocations, and other business factors that we would face with a workforce tied to a single country or region. Our government 
affairs teams are also engaged at the local, state, and country levels to lobby for policies that are aligned to our values and business continuity.

Alignment and consistent and clear communication are key parts of our employee engagement, especially as we continue 
to grow. Each year, we complete a corporate V2MOM, which is an internal management tool used to align the Company on 
our vision, values, methods, obstacles and measures for the upcoming year. All employees are then expected to complete 
their own V2MOM that aligns with the corporate V2MOM.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION OF SELECTED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL METRICS
Purpose of this document 
Salesforce, Inc. (“Salesforce”, “we”, “us”, “our”) believes that values drive value, and that along with our 
Profitable Growth strategy of driving sustainable top line and bottom line progression, effectively managing our 
priority Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) topics will help create long-term value for our investors. 
Our core values of Trust, Customer Success, Innovation, Equality and Sustainability guide us as we operationalize 
these values across our company. Transparency is a key pillar of our commitment to ESG excellence. We believe 
companies should clearly report progress and consistently communicate decision-useful information on ESG topics 
to their key stakeholders. Our belief is that comparable, consistent, and verified ESG disclosure is critical to 
understanding the long-term health and resilience of a business. 
The purpose of this document is to report on and provide transparency into our calculation methodologies for 
selected ESG metrics, some of which are subject to a limited assurance third party review by Ernst & Young LLP 
(“EY”) (see Independent Accountants’ Review Report at pg. 7) and to provide a brief commentary on our results 
relative to our key environmental and social goals. Metrics included in this document have been determined based 
on ESG materiality assessments and alignment to our core values of equality and sustainability. We have structured 
this document in a manner similar to our Form 10-K, which includes a brief overview of our key programs and 
goals, selected schedules detailing our key metrics, and footnotes that provide transparency into our calculation 
methodology.
This document should be read in conjunction with our existing disclosures on our longstanding ESG 
programs, which include more comprehensive reporting of our risks, overall strategy, governance structures, goals 
and results, which can be found on our website, in our annual Stakeholder Impact Report, our Climate Action Plan, 
our Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) report, our Form 10-K and our Proxy 
Statements. This document and the content of the various websites referenced throughout this document are not 
incorporated by reference and do not constitute a part of any filing we have made or will make with the SEC, 
regardless of any general incorporation language in such filing.
Environment Overview
Salesforce envisions a net zero, nature positive future for all. We operationalize sustainability into core 
business decisions, supported by rigorous data, to drive efficiency and innovation. Our integrated sustainability 
strategy can be found at salesforce.com/sustainability.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we maintained our achievement of three key targets: 
1.
Maintain net zero residual emissions across our full value chain. That means we purchase carbon credits
equivalent to Salesforce’s residual scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. See our Sustainability FAQs for more about
what net zero residual emissions means to Salesforce.
2.
Procure electricity or renewable energy certificates from renewable energy resources equivalent to 100
percent of the electricity we used globally, calculated based on the methodology described in Notes 7 and 8
to the Consolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics, respectively.
3.
Reduce our scope 1 and 2 market-based method (“MBM”) emissions by 50 percent ahead of our fiscal
2031 target
We also made progress against a number of other environmental targets included below.
Absolute Emissions Reduction and Science-Based Targets:
In fiscal 2019, we set science-based targets (“SBTs”) formally with the Science Based Targets initiative 
(“SBTi”) covering our greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Our five-year SBT refresh will take place in fiscal 2025. 
These targets are intended to be consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5°C and include:
1.
Reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 MBM GHG emissions by 50 percent by fiscal 2031 from a fiscal 2019
base year.
2.
Reduce our scope 3 MBM GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related (“FERA”) activities by 50 percent
by fiscal 2031 from a fiscal 2019 base year.
3.
Ensure that suppliers representing 60 percent of our applicable scope 3 location-based method (“LBM”)
GHG emissions, covering purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and
distribution, waste generated in operations, and upstream leased assets will set science-based targets by the
end of fiscal 2025.
In fiscal 2022, within our Climate Action Plan, we announced our intentions to reduce our absolute emissions, 
defined as scope 1, scope 2 LBM, and scope 3 LBM emissions from a fiscal 2019 baseline, with science-based goals 
3

of a 50 percent reduction in absolute emissions by fiscal 2031 and 90 percent reduction in absolute emissions by 
fiscal 2041.

(1) The absolute emissions reduction goal of 50 percent is the near term fiscal 2031 target. The long term goal is 90
percent reduction in absolute emissions by fiscal 2041. Both of these goals are calculated from a 2019 base year
and are only achievable with additional innovation and investment. See Climate Action Plan for more details.
(2) In fiscal 2023, we updated our supplier engagement target language with the SBTi to clearly identify the
categories covered by this target.
In fiscal 2024 and 2023 we achieved 100 percent renewable energy and net zero residual emissions. Our net 
zero residual emissions calculation is based on the methodology described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Statements 
of Environmental Metrics and does not currently align with the SBTi’s definition of Net-Zero as published in 
October 2021, which outlines that in order for a company to claim net zero GHG emissions they must (1) set and 
achieve various short and long term emissions targets aligned with 1.5°C global average temperature warming and 
(2) neutralize all residual emissions through carbon dioxide removals (carbon credits associated with projects that
remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere) after the short and long term emissions targets are achieved.
We support the SBTi’s efforts and plan to achieve our near term absolute emissions reduction targets by fiscal 
2031 and 2041, respectively, ten years earlier than recommended by the SBTi, and by transitioning our carbon credit 
portfolio from avoidance to removal carbon credits over the long term. This transition may result in increased costs 
and present challenges due to our expectation that there will be limited availability of high quality removal carbon 
credits relative to demand from corporate buyers. 
4

In fiscal 2024 and 2023, we reported an increase in absolute emissions as compared to our base year of 26.7 
percent and 22.6 percent, respectively. These increases, compared to the base year, are largely due to the continued 
growth of our business; as we grow, so do our expenditures and corresponding emissions. However, in fiscal 2024, 
we experienced a slowing in the growth of absolute emissions as a result of the Company’s operational excellence 
initiative which lead to decreased expenditures. 
Past emissions inventories have shown that the vast majority of our emissions occur in the upstream value 
chain, particularly in category 1 purchased goods and services. In an effort to improve the accuracy of our value 
chain emissions, we collected higher quality data with more specificity during fiscal 2024. As we transition to 
supplier-specific data, we expect overall scope 3 emissions to decrease relative to the spend-based method due to 
engagement with our supply chain partners as demonstrated below in our scope 3 supplier engagement SBT. 
Specifically, approximately 46 percent of our applicable upstream Scope 3 LBM emissions are calculated using the 
spend-based approach, while 52 percent were determined using the hybrid approach, and the remaining 2 percent 
were calculated using other methodologies. Historically, the majority of our scope 3 emissions were determined 
using the spend-based method. This approach utilizes less specific, industry-average data and serves as a screening 
process to determine the scale and relative magnitude of emissions. The spend-based approach and the hybrid 
approach are discussed in additional detail below.
However, achieving our ambitious absolute emissions reduction goals remain challenging. Given the 
continued growth of our company, systemic global decarbonization is necessary. For further insights into our 
strategies to drive these changes, refer to our Climate Action Plan, which outlines our efforts in education, 
mobilization, innovation, regulation, and policy. 
In fiscal 2024 and 2023, we reported the percentage of applicable scope 3 LBM emissions from suppliers with 
set SBTs as 25.3 and 15.8 percent, respectively. We remain focused on supplier engagement and enablement as we 
strive to meet the target by the end of fiscal 2025.
Environmental Metrics - Including Looking Forward to Fiscal 2025 and Beyond
We continually review emissions quantification methodologies and are committed to implementing best 
practice quantification methodologies. For example, in fiscal 2024, we implemented the hybrid methodology for 
Scope 3 reporting. Historically, Salesforce has calculated emissions for several scope 3 categories using the spend-
based method outlined in the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation Guidance. This approach quantifies emissions 
using less specific, industry-average data and serves as a screening process to determine the size and relative 
magnitude of emissions in the upstream scope 3 categories. Past inventories confirmed the vast majority of 
emissions are in the upstream value chain, particularly in category 1, purchased goods and services. Therefore, to 
improve the accuracy of our value-chain emissions quantification, Salesforce aims to collect higher quality, primary 
data with more supplier specificity. Supplier-specific emissions hold a higher level of emissions data specificity 
compared to the spend-based method. This more specific data can be obtained through a combination of resources 
such as CDP, direct supplier engagement, and publicly available data.
As a result of refinements to our calculation methodology and classification determinations for certain 
categories, we may occasionally update our previously presented emissions.
Changes in fiscal 2024 and beyond may include:
•
Scope 3 emissions – For specific suppliers and categories, such as purchased goods and services, we
implemented a hybrid approach as mentioned above to migrate away from purely spend-based method to
using emissions data obtained directly from our suppliers as more information becomes readily available.
This change is designed to improve the quality of data in our scope 3 emissions disclosures and affect prior
period disclosures.
•
Base year recalculations - We updated the base year, as well as interim years’, numbers to include
emissions from Slack and Tableau, which were acquired in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020, respectively, and
the implementation of the hybrid methodology to maintain data consistency and more easily compare our
current year results.
•
Scope 3 MBM and LBM dual presentation - To enhance transparency, we disclosed both Market-Based
(MBM) and Location-Based (LBM) emissions for our scope 3 calculations. The LBM quantifies emissions
based on average energy generation emission factors for defined geographic locations, including local,
subnational, or national boundaries whereas the MBM quantifies emissions based on GHG emissions
emitted by the generators from which the reporter contractually purchases electricity bundled with
5

contractual instruments, or contractual instruments on their own. While we actively pursue renewable 
energy initiatives reflected in our MBM emissions, we recognize the importance of transparently presenting 
our emissions, irrespective of reliance on renewable energy sources.

Equality Overview
Equality is a core value at Salesforce. We live this value by fostering a more inclusive workplace and 
advancing greater equality in society. We remain focused on accelerating equality within our organization, across 
the Salesforce ecosystem, and in our communities around the world.
During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we maintained our achievement of two key targets: 
1.
Ensure at least 50 percent of our U.S. employees are made up of underrepresented groups
(“underrepresented groups” or “URG”), which we define as employees who identify as Women, Black,
Latina/o/x, Indigenous, Two or more races, LGBTQ+, People with Disabilities, and Veterans.
2.
Double the U.S. representation of Black employees in leadership positions vice president or higher (VP+)
positions, from October 2019 baseline.
However, in fiscal 2024, Salesforce experienced a significant decrease in hiring volume as compared to 
previous years. The functional and regional mix in hiring both in the U.S. and globally has shifted to be more 
focused in India and on functional roles within Tech and Product. We have also experienced a significant shift in the 
Company's focus on operating margins and business performance, which slowed momentum toward greater 
representation earlier in the year. These factors impacted our ability to drive progress on URM representation in the 
U.S, resulting in not achieving our two URM targets. Going forward, driving results on our representation goals will
require intentional effort across the entire Company and, as such, we are currently assessing future fiscal year
targets.
We also began reporting on a new goal for fiscal 2027 to achieve 40 percent Global Women and Non-binary 
representation.
In fiscal 2024, our progress towards our selected equality goals, all of which have a target year of fiscal 2024 
other than the Global Women and Non-binary representation which has a target year of 2027, were as follows:

Equality Metric Measurement
We continually review our equality metric measurement and are committed to implementing best practice 
disclosures. For example, in fiscal 2024, our disclosure of equality and diversity metrics includes all metrics as 
defined by GRI disclosure component 405-1b, disclosing the percentage of employees by level and function across 
gender, age, and ethnicity.

Independent Accountants’ Review Report
To the Board of Directors and Management of Salesforce, Inc.
We have reviewed Salesforce, Inc.’s (“Salesforce”) Consolidated Statements of Environmental
Metrics and Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics (collectively the “Consolidated
Statements”), and the related Notes to the Consolidated Statements (the “Subject Matter”)
included in Salesforce’s Schedules of Selected Environmental and Social Metrics as of and for
the year ended January 31, 2024, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Notes to the
Consolidated Statements (the “Criteria”). Salesforce’s management is responsible for the
Subject Matter in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on
the Subject Matter based on our review.
Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts
Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those
standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about
whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in
accordance with the Criteria. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing
from and are substantially less in extent than, an examination, the objective of which is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all
material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an
opinion. Because of the limited nature of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a
review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an
examination been performed. As such, a review does not provide assurance that we became
aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that the
review evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our
conclusion.
We are required to be independent of Salesforce and to meet our other ethical responsibilities,
in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our review engagement.
Additionally, we have complied with the other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of
Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by
the AICPA.
The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Our review consisted
principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the
subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes
used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
As described in the Notes to the Consolidated Statements, the Subject Matter is subject to
measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods
used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement
techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different
measurement techniques may also vary.
8

Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions are calculated based on a significant number of estimations
and management assumptions due to the inherent nature of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard as well as the Technical
Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions criteria.
The information included in Salesforce’s Schedules of Selected Environmental and Social
Metrics, other than the Subject Matter, has not been subjected to the procedures applied in our
review and, accordingly, we express no conclusion on it.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the
Consolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics, Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics
and the related Notes to the Consolidated Statements as of and for the year ended January 31,
2024 in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

(1) Emissions from combusting biodiesel and refrigerants were excluded from scope 1 calculations because these are
biogenic emissions and non-Kyoto Protocol gases are reported separately in accordance with the GHG Protocol.
For example, for fiscal 2024, 203 metric tons of CO2 emissions from combusting biodiesel were excluded as well
as 1,053 metric tons ofrefrigerant emissions from non-Kyoto Protocol gases. Emissions data for direct CO2 
emissions from biologically sequestered carbon (e.g., CO2 from burning biomass/biofuels), are reported
separately from the scopes.
(2) Fiscal 2023 was the first year this metric was reported. For the base year, Fiscal 2019, scope 3 LBM and MBM
values include acquisition emissions data which is reflected at the scope 3 value chain level above, but not
included in the upstream and downstream level.

Salesforce, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics 
1. Summary of Business and Significant Policies
Description of Business 
Salesforce, Inc. (the "Company") is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that 
brings companies and customers together. With the Customer 360 platform, the Company delivers a single source of 
truth, connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and 
conduct commerce from anywhere. Since its founding in 1999, Salesforce has pioneered innovations in cloud, 
mobile, social, analytics and artificial intelligence, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their 
businesses in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere era. 
The Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2024, for example, refer to the fiscal year 
ending January 31, 2024. Fiscal 2019 has been set as the Company's base year (see Note 3). 
Rounding 
Figures in the Consolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics and accompanying footnotes have been 
rounded to the nearest thousand. 
Basis of Presentation 
Scope 1 emissions information has been prepared in accordance with the World Resources Institute ("WRl") I
World Business Council for Sustainable Development's ("WBCSD") Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Protocol: A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised. 
Scope 2 indirect emissions information, calculated using the location-based and market-based methods, have 
been prepared in accordance with the WRl WBCSD GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard, Revised and the WRl WBCSD GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance: An amendment to the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Standard. 
Scope 3 GHG emissions information has been prepared in accordance with the WRl WBCSD Corporate 
Value Chain (Scope 3), Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Scope 3 Technical Guidance. 
Collectively, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised, the 
GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance: An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard, the GHG Protocol 
Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3), Accounting and Reporting Standard, and the Scope 3 Technical Guidance are 
collectively referred to as the "GHG Protocol" in this document. 
GHG emissions included in inventory 
The following GHGs are included as part of the Company's scope 1 and 2 inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CRi), nitrous oxide (N2O), and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Other GHGs, including perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), are not included in the Company's inventory as 
they do not generate material scope 1 or scope 2 emissions as part of the Company's operations. The Company's 
scope 3 inventory includes all seven GHGs covered by the Kyoto Protocol (CO2, CRi, N20, HFCs, PFCs, SF6, and 
NF3). 
The Company does not present all of these GHGs separately, and instead converts all emissions to carbon 
dioxide equivalents (CO2e) for reporting. CO2 is the only significant GHG for the Company, making up 99 percent 
of total emissions. Other GHGs, including CRi, N2O, and emissions from refrigerants make up the remaining 1 
percent. 
12 

Use of Estimates 
The Company bases its estimates and methodologies on historical experience, available information, and 
various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable. 
Environmental and energy use data used in the preparation of the Consolidated Statements of Environmental 
Metrics are subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in nature and the methods used 
for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially 
different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. As the Company updates 
its methodologies and as new information becomes available, the Company may continue to revise its estimates, 
assumptions and emissions factors used to calculate its emissions in scope 1, 2 and 3. 
Acquisitions 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from acquisitions made by the Company are generally accounted for in the fiscal 
year following the acquisition date. For example, in fiscal 2022, the Company acquired Slack Technologies, Inc. 
("Slack") for approximately $27 .1 billion, and emissions for Slack were reflected in the following fiscal 2023 
figured. Both Slack and Tableau, which was acquired in fiscal 2020, acquisitions are included in the base year as 
well as all interim and current year calculations. 
2. Organizational and Operational Boundaries
The Company utilizes the operational control approach, which means it accounts for GHG emissions from 
operations over which it has control. This approach covers the Company's global operations. The Company defines 
operational control as having the authority to introduce and implement operational policies over an asset or a 
location and reports on all emissions for the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. 
All known activities within the Company's supply chain but outside of the Company's direct control as 
defined GHG Protocol Scope 3 Categories are recorded within the scope 3 indirect emissions. 
Scope 1 
Direct emissions are from the combustion of fuel from sources that are owned or controlled by the Company 
and include: 
Emissions Source 
Salesforce Boundary Description 
Stationary 
Combustion of natural gas from stationary sources such as boilers and generators occurring 
Combustion 
within owned and occupied buildings. 
Mobile Combustion 
Combustion of fuel from corporate jets contracted by the Company and Company shuttles 
contracted by the Company. Fuel burn rates for corporate jets are obtained from external 
sources and are based on the actual jet types used. 
Scopel 
Indirect emissions are emissions occurring outside of the Company's organizational boundaries to produce 
electricity or heat purchased for use at the Company's locations under the Company's operational control and 
include: 
Emissions Source 
Salesforce Boundary Description 
Purchased Electricity Purchased electricity for all owned and leased offices and data centers. 
Heat/Steam 
Purchased natural gas, diesel, fuel oil and district steam for all leased offices and data 
centers. 
Fugitive Emissions 
Fugitive emissions from refrigerant leaks at all leased offices and data centers that have 
cooling systems with active refrigerants. 
Scope3 
Indirect value chain emissions include emissions from the Company's upstream or downstream value chain 
activities. In accordance with the WRI/WBCSD Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, the Company evaluates 
the 15 Categories of emissions as follows, noting that all reported scope 3 emissions are calculated within the 
minimum boundaries for the respective category. Where optional emissions outside of the minimum boundary are 
included they are noted as "optional." In our scope 3 emissions calculations, we have provided a disclosure of both 
MBM and LBM emissions for Categories 1-5, 8, and 13. 
13

In fiscal 2024, we implemented the hybrid methodology. Historically, Salesforce has calculated emissions for 
several scope 3 categories using the spend-based method outlined in the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation 
Guidance. This approach quantifies emissions using industry-average data and serves as a screening process to 
determine the size and relative magnitude of emissions in the upstream scope 3 categories. Past inventories 
confirmed the vast majority of emissions are in the upstream value chain, particularly in category 1, purchased 
goods and services. To improve the accuracy of our value-chain emissions quantification, Salesforce aims to collect 
higher quality, primary data with more supplier specificity. This more specific data can be obtained through a 
combination of resources such as CDP, direct supplier engagement, and publicly available data. 
Scope 3 Category

3. Base Year (unreviewed)
In fiscal 2019, the Company set science-based targets ("SBTs") covering selected components of its GHG 
emissions. Verifiable emissions data was available and the measurements against fiscal 2019 were meaningful to its 
company targets. Therefore, the Company has deemed fiscal 2019 as the base year for the Company. Emissions data 
is assessed against data from the base year to track and communicate performance. 
The base year emissions are subject to recalculation should a material change be identified, including changes 
in calculation methodology, changes due to data accuracy and structural change including mergers, acquisitions, and 
divestments. The Company has determined that adjustments will be made for the changes listed above impacting 
prior period results by 5% of the total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in the base year. 
In fiscal 2024, the Company updated the base year emissions to include its acquisitions, Slack and Tableau. 
Additionally, methodological changes from the hybrid method are incorporated. 
4. Emissions Factors and Global Warming Potentials
The global warming potentials for each GHG are sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change Fourth or Fifth Assessment Report, Appendix A: Global Warming Potentials. 
Emissions factors applied by scope are as follows:

The Company uses emissions factors provided by the Environmental Protection Agency 
Mobile Combustion ("EPA") Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2023. 
Scope 2 
The Company discloses emission factors for both the location-based methodology ("LBM") and the market­
based methodology ("MBM"), in accordance with the GHG Protocol. The LBM quantifies emissions based on 
average energy generation emission factors for defined geographic locations, including local, subnational, or 
national boundaries whereas the MBM quantifies emissions based on GHG emissions emitted by the generators 
from which the reporter contractually purchases electricity bundled with contractual instruments, or contractual 
instruments on their own. To estimate total electricity consumption including the overhead (e.g., cooling), IT 
electricity is multiplied by the power usage effectiveness (PUE). Scope 2 Emissions also references the Information 
and Communication Technology ("ICT") Sector Guidance 'Built on the GHG Protocol Product Life Cycle

As described in the tables below, when calculating all relevant scope 3 emissions, the Company used the 
following relevant factors: 
•
Supplier-specific emissions, allocated to Salesforce, sourced from suppliers through CDP or directly;
•
Supplier-specific revenue intensity emission factors, calculated by using the supplier's scope 1, 2 (LBM
and MBM) and upstream scope 3 emissions, obtained from CDP data, and dividing it by total revenue;
•

The Company deploys the following relevant calculation methodologies: 
•
Supplier-specific approach - use of cradle-to-gate emissions or emission factors sourced from suppliers,
directly corresponding to the goods and services purchased
•
Hybrid approach - includes a combination of both emissions obtained directly from suppliers and
emissions calculated based on revenue intensity from suppliers spend and emissions
•
Spend-based approach - utilizes annual spend with suppliers and EEIO data to convert spend data to
estimated emissions based on the type of good or services purchased
•
Average-data approach - involves use of secondary emission factors to estimate emissions based on
physical activity data
•
Distance-based approach - use of distance traveled, by mode of transport, to estimate emissions
associated with transportation
•
Energy-based approach - use of energy activity data multiplied by published emission factors per
emission source

Company leverages an employee commuting and a 
work from home survey to determine the emissions 
profile of the Company's employee commutes and 
remote work. Incremental energy consumption is 
calculated based on the results of the employee 
survey. Then, emission factors are applied based on

per market value which is then applied to the total 
average carrying value of the Company's strategic 
investment portfolio during the fiscal year as a 
proxy of emissions.

5. Sustainable Aviation Fuel
In fiscal 2023, all prior year business travel emissions calculations were adjusted to include the use of 
DEFRA's well-to-tank ("WTT") emission factors, in addition to the previously utilized combustion factors from 
U.S. EPA and DEFRA. Starting in fiscal 2023, the Company also began receiving Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
certificates ("SAF c"), which represent one metric ton of CO2e through the purchase of attributes to support their 
production and use of sustainable aviation fuel. However, in fiscal 2023, the Company excluded these SAFcs from 
the calculation of net residual emissions, and in fiscal 2024, there were no purchases ofSAFcs. 
6. Carbon Credits
The Company currently uses both removal and avoidance carbon credits to achieve net zero residual 
emissions. The Company determines the classification of each carbon credit based on the definition from the 
Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets: 
•
Removal projects capture, remove or store CO2 from the atmosphere, including through nature-based
sequestration and technology-based removal.
•
Avoidance projects reduce emissions from current sources, such as by funding the implementation oflow
carbon technologies such as renewable energy, and avoiding practices that cause emissions such as by
reducing deforestation.
Carbon credits purchased by the Company support projects that lower atmospheric CO2 and have
compelling positive social and environmental benefits. These carbon credits must be certified by a market standard 
that is endorsed by the International Carbon Reduction and Offset Alliance ("ICROA"), including but not limited to 
the Gold Standard, the Verified Carbon Standard ("VCS"), American Carbon Registry ("ACR"), United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change Clean Development Mechanism ("UNFCCC CDM"), or the Climate 
Action Reserve ("CAR"). In addition, many of the projects that the Company sources credits from have also been 
certified by the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance Standards, and have been assessed by independent, 
third-party ratings agencies. All carbon credits are retired on a public registry at the amount equal to the Company's 
scope 1, scope 2 MBM, and scope 3 MBM emissions. 
Carbon Credits purchased by suppliers 
In each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2024 and 2023, suppliers purchased carbon credits on behalf 
of their portion of Company's scope 3 GHG emissions, which make up more than 9 percent of the total carbon 
credits applied in each year. These credits are included in the total reported carbon credits for the same fiscal year. 
The fiscal 2019 base year does not include carbon credits purchased by suppliers on behalf of the Company. 
7. Net residual emissions
The Company calculates its net residual emissions as its total scope 1, scope 2 MBM and scope 3 MBM 
emissions less its avoidance and removal carbon credits. In fiscal 2024, the Company reported net residual emissions 
of zero, or net zero residual emissions. 
8. Percentage of total global electricity procured from renewable energy resources
The Company calculates the percentage of total global electricity procured from renewable energy 
resources by dividing total renewable electricity or renewable energy certificates procured from renewable energy 
resources by total global electricity usage. The Company includes all electricity procured from renewable energy 
resources in its calculation regardless of the market in which the renewable energy was consumed. 
Percentage of total global electricity procured from renewable energy resources is measured in Megawatt 
Hours ("MWh"). Renewable energy resources include utility renewable energy tariffs, supplier-provided renewable 
energy, renewable energy certificate purchases, and indirect large offsite purchases including virtual power purchase 
agreements ("VPPAs"). 
The Company's total global electricity usage includes electricity consumed, measured in MWh, at all of its 
global facilities including offices and data centers under its operational control.

(2) The fiscal 2019 base year and fiscal 2023 were recalculated to include both the hybrid methodology and
refinement of the applicable scope 3 LBM emissions.
The percentage of applicable scope 3 LBM emissions from suppliers with SB Ts is calculated by dividing 
the emissions from suppliers with SBTs by the applicable scope 3 LBM emissions for the year. 
Suppliers with SBTs represents suppliers who either obtained a validation from the SBTi on their near-term 
science-based emissions reductions targets in line with a well-below 2°C or a l .5°C scenario, or have provided an 
attestation to the Company that they have set science-based emissions reductions targets in line with the SBTi 
criteria. The Company only includes suppliers across the purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream 
transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, and upstream leased assets scope 3 category. 
Applicable scope 3 LBM emissions is calculated by summing the emissions for the Scope 3 categories 
included in the goal: purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation, waste generated in 
operations, and upstream leased assets. 
The Company calculates the percent of suppliers who have committed to setting an SBT by dividing the 
emissions from suppliers committed to setting SBTs by the applicable scope 3 LBM emissions for the year.

(1) Fiscal 2023 is the first year of measurement for suppliers committed to setting SBTs.
Suppliers committed to setting SBTs represents suppliers who have formally committed to develop and 
submit targets to the SBTi and are recognized as "committed" with the SBTi on their near-term science-based 
emissions reductions targets as of the fiscal year end. These organizations are recognized by the SBTi as having 
made a public commitment to set a science-based target aligned with the SBTi's target-setting criteria within 24 
months. The Company has not confirmed that these committed targets are in line with a well-below 2°C or a l .5°C 
scenario. However, this measure is only used to further inform the Company's progress towards our 60 percent 
target. Suppliers are not included in the performance metric until their SBTs have been independently validated by 
the SB Ti, or the supplier provides the Company with an alternative form of attestation. 
Applicable scope 3 LBM emissions from suppliers who have committed to setting SBTs is calculated using 
the same applicable scope 3 LBM emissions as those used in calculating the percentage of applicable scope 3 LBM 
emissions from suppliers with SBTs. 
In fiscal 2023, the Company updated their target language with the SBTi to better reflect the intent of the 
initial target submissions.

Notes to Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics 
1. Summary of Business and Significant Policies
Refer to the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Environmental Metrics for a description of the business and 
fiscal year. 
Use of Estimates 
Non-financial diversity and equality information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from 
limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data, such as the reliance on individuals 
to self report their information in our human capital management system. The selection of different but acceptable 
measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement 
techniques may also vary. 
Rounding 
Figures in the Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics have been rounded to the nearest tenth of a 
percentage. 
Employees and Impact from Acquisitions 
The Company includes both full time and part time employees in its diversity and equality calculations. The 
Company includes employee data from any acquisition or divestiture made by the Company at the earlier of: the one 
year anniversary of the acquisition or the date of harmonization of employees from the acquisition. All employees 
that have joined the Company through acquisition are included in the Company's fiscal 2024 results. 
Basis of Presentation 
The Consolidated Statements of Social Metrics are prepared as defined by GRI 405-1 b and include employees 
by gender, employees by age, and employees by ethnicity. The Company excludes the other criteria included in GRI 
405-1, for example, percentage of individuals within governance bodies. This information is included in the
Company's annual proxy filing and is not subject to assurance. Reported progress against established goals within
the Company follow custom criteria and those goals and measurements are explained below. The Company's
reporting of social metrics aligns with its fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.
2. Criteria
Employees by Gender 
For presentation purposes, ''women" represent individuals whose biological sex is "female" and "men" 
represent individuals whose biological sex is "male" in the Company's human resource management system. If 
employees are listed with biological sex other than "male" or "female," they have been presented as "Other/ 
Undisclosed." 
Employee Category 
GRI 405-1 b establishes that a Company must disclose percentage of employees by employee category in 
alignment with gender, age, and other indicators of diversity where relevant. Employee category is required to 
encompass both level and function. 
Level 
The Company has concluded that level be split between those employees who are in leadership 
positions and those who are not. The Company defines leadership for the purpose of presentation as vice 
president roles and higher. 
Function 
The Company has concluded that function is best disaggregated between those employees in 
technology roles and those who are not. The Company defines technology roles as all technical occupations 
in computing and information technology, all occupations that require deep technical specialization and 
knowledge, as well as managers, directors, and executives who oversee technical employees and the 
development and delivery of technical products. Additionally, the workforce is defined by position, not 
department.

Other indicators of diversity 
GRI 405-1 b(iii) establishes that a Company report the percentage of employees by employee category by other 
indicators of diversity. The Company defines "other indicators of diversity" as employee ethnicity in the U.S. 
Employees who did not self-disclose their ethnicity are included in the ''undisclosed" ethnicity category. There are 
no other indicators of diversity for global employees. 
Underrepresented Group 
The Company defines an underrepresented group ("URG") as Women, Black, Latina/o/x, Indigenous, Two or 
more races, LGBTQ+, People with Disabilities, and Veterans. URG is defined to include gender, ethnic, and other 
groups that are historically underrepresented within the U.S. technology industry. As such, women have been 
included as a URG and Asian and Indian ethnicities are not included as an URG. 
Employees who did not self-disclose as one of the URGs were assumed to be unaffiliated with any URG. Ifan 
employee self identifies as multiple UR Gs, they are only included once for the purposes of the calculation. The 
Company calculates this metric for U.S. employees only. 
URG representation is calculated by dividing the number of U.S. employees identified under at least one of the 
URGs by the total number of U.S. employees. 
Underrepresented Minority and Underrepresented Minority in leadership 
The Company defines an underrepresented minority ("URM") as Black, Latina/o/x, Indigenous, and 
individuals who identify with two or more races. URM is defined to include ethnicities that are historically 
underrepresented within the U.S. technology industry. 
Employees who did not self-disclose as one of these ethnicities were assumed to be unaffiliated with any 
URM. If an employee self identifies as multiple URMs, they are only included once for the purposes of the 
calculation. The Company calculates this metric for U.S. employees only. 
URM representation is calculated by dividing the number of U.S. employees identified under at least one of the 
URMs by the total number of U.S. employees. 
Progress against baseline is calculated by dividing the current year URM representation percentage less the 
base year URM representation percentage by the base year URM representation percentage. 
URM leadership representation (U.S. only) is calculated by dividing the number of U.S. employees in 
leadership positions (VP+) who identified under at least one of the URMs by the total number of U.S. employees in 
leadership positions. 
Progress against baseline is calculated by dividing the current year URM leadership representation percentage 
less the base year URM leadership representation percentage by the base year URM leadership representation 
percentage. 
Black Leadership 
Black leadership representation (U.S. only) is calculated by dividing the number of U.S. employees in 
leadership positions (VP+) who self-identified as Black or African American by the total number of U.S. employees 
in leadership positions. 
Progress against baseline is calculated by diving the current year Black leadership representation percentage 
less the base year Black leadership representation percentage by the base year Black leadership representation 
percentage. 
Global Women and Non-binary 
Global Women and Non-binary representation is calculated by dividing the number of global employees who 
identified as Woman or Non-binary which includes both "Gender Non-Binary/Non-Conforming" and "Transgender" 
employees, by the total number of global employees. 
Progress against baseline is calculated by dividing the current year global women and non-binary 
representation percentage less the base year global women and non-binary representation percentage by the base 
year women and non-binary representation percentage.
