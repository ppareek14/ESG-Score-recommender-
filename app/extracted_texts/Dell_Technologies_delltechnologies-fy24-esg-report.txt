A message from our Chairman and CEO 
A lot has changed in the 40 years since I first launched 
Dell from a University of Texas dorm room, but what 
hasn’t changed is our commitment to creating technology 
that drives human progress. In fact, our mission is more 
powerful and important than ever. 
From the PC to the internet to the cloud, we’ve helped 
customers put their data to work to drive incredible 
outcomes. Now, with generative AI it feels like the last 
few decades have just been the pregame show. AI will 
revolutionize how we live and work, and it will drive 
unprecedented advances across every domain of human 
endeavor. From education to healthcare to physics, AI will 
help deliver radical progress and productivity. 
We need to work together to ensure AI lives up to its 
potential by encouraging responsible use and ensuring 
its application is as beneficial to people and our planet as 
possible. The evolving regulatory environment is on the 
minds of our customers, partners, suppliers and investors.  
Michael Dell 
Chairman and CEO 
Dell Technologies 
Sustainability and ESG commitments are now widely 
recognized as business imperatives that impact 
everything from supplier decisions to business strategy. 
At Dell, we are both meeting our goals and helping 
customers meet theirs. 
In the following report, we hold ourselves accountable 
and share progress against our commitment to create 
positive business, social and environmental impact. 
Dell Technologies is rooted in innovation and progress, 
and this brings exciting opportunities for collaboration 
across our ecosystem of customers, partners and team 
members. Together, we can realize our greatest ambitions 
and do it responsibly. 
We’re here to support you and are grateful for the 
opportunity to partner with you. 
“
”
We need to work together to 
ensure AI lives up to its potential 
by encouraging responsible use 
and ensuring its application is 
as beneficial to people and our 
planet as possible.

A message from our VP, Corporate Sustainability and ESG 
We actively support our customers and partners in 
achieving their goals while making a lasting impact for 
business, people and the planet. 
Our approach includes embedding Sustainability and 
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) throughout 
our value chain and technology stack. We engage our 
supply chain to drive emissions reductions, use innovative 
materials and takeback programs to advance the circular 
economy and collaborate with nonprofits with the aim to 
bring everyone access to the benefits of technology. 
Our FY24 ESG Report is one way we’re holding ourselves 
accountable against our ambitious goals for 2030 and 
beyond, and we continue to invest in initiatives that apply 
our technology, scale and talented workforce to address 
complex challenges like climate change, accelerating 
the circular economy, creating inclusive workplaces and 
addressing the digital divide. 
Cassandra Garber 
Vice President, Corporate 
Sustainability and ESG  
Our FY24 highlights include: 
• Closing in on our packaging goal, with 96.4% of 
packaging across our entire product portfolio made 
with recycled or renewable materials. 
• 949,000 hours of volunteer work logged by our 
team members, spanning community projects such 
as park cleanups to skill-based work through the Pro 
Bono program. 
• Over 396 million people benefiting from our digital 
inclusion programs, partnerships and innovation since 
FY20. These efforts provide access to technology, 
connectivity, digital skills and support for under-
resourced communities around the world. 
• Receipt of a platinum EcoVadis 2023 medal for 
scoring in the top 1% of companies assessed across 
four major themes: environment, labor and human 
rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. 
• Launched more products featuring recycled, renewable 
and reduced carbon emissions materials. In FY24, we 
used over 43 million kg (95 million lbs) of sustainable 
materials  in our products and were the first in the 
industry to ship certified 50% recycled content steel in 
our displays.  
Underpinning all these highlights are our continued 
partnerships and collaboration inside and outside our 
organization. And as we explore the opportunities and 
address the environmental and social impacts that 
come with AI, we will continue to work alongside and 
support our customers, partners and communities.  
The next phase of how we use technology to create 
meaningful impact, build trust and create a more 
sustainable and inclusive world for everyone is a 
phase unlike any before, and one we’re excited to 
embark on together.

This is the beginning of the navigation for the page. To exit the navigation, press the “H” key on your keyboard.

We believe transparent ESG reporting is 
a business imperative, which is why we 
focus on the metrics that matter most to 
our stakeholders. 
We welcome the standardization, simplification and 
harmonization of international reporting standards, and 
we are committed to driving meaningful impact and 
transparently disclosing our progress. Our approach 
to disclosure is informed by global standards and 
frameworks including those outlined below, and we 
continue monitoring and preparing for the evolving 
reporting landscape. 
Reporting 
frameworks 
SASB 
We map our disclosures to the standards for 
software and IT services and hardware established 
by SASB. These standards help to guide the 
reporting of ESG issues most pertinent to 
stakeholders. We are disclosing on the topics 
that we consider material to our operations, using 
SASB’s standards for the hardware and software 
and IT industries. 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
We publish disclosures referencing the GRI 
standards, emphasizing the issues and indicators 
that are most relevant to our business and 
our stakeholders. GRI standards enhance the 
comparability and quality of information on 
economic, environmental and social impacts 
(positive and negative) organizations have. They 
also create a common language to communicate 
that information to stakeholders.  
CDP Water Security and Climate Change 
Responses 
Since 2017, we have provided CDP Water 
Security and Climate Change responses, which 
help us to measure, manage and report our 
environmental impact.  
Our GRI, SASB, and WEF SCM indexes can be 
found in our Reporting Frameworks Index. 
View current and archived copies of all our 
ESG reports. 
Preparing for an evolving 
reporting landscape 
ESG reporting is rapidly evolving with the growing adoption 
of the International Sustainability Standards Board’s 
(ISSB) reporting standards globally, transposition of the 
Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in 
European Union member countries and development of 
other regional and national requirements around the world. 
Dell currently reports on ESG in its financial statements; 
however, these new or evolving regulations require 
expanded reporting. We are actively preparing for these 
comprehensive and granular disclosures covering a broad 
range of sustainability topics. 
World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder 
Capitalism Metrics (SCM) 
Dell, alongside 25 other companies, was one of the 
initial signatories of the initiative by the WEF to align 
and focus corporate ESG disclosures. To meet this 
commitment, Dell reports on the WEF framework’s 
core Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics. 
U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
In the Goals Dashboard, we map alignment of our 
goals with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs).

Taking action on 
climate change 
As a leading technology provider with 
operations, supply chain and customers 
that span the globe, we are committed to 
understanding the impact our business 
has on the environment. We are taking 
action to mitigate climate change, and we 
offer innovative products and solutions 
to customers to help them reduce their 
emissions, reach their reduction targets 
and operate more efficiently. 
2050 GOAL 
KEY DRIVERS 
By 2050, we will achieve net zero 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
across scopes 1, 2 and 3 
Our approach to climate action 
The need to mitigate the negative impacts of climate 
change is clear, compelling and required to meet key 
aspects of the Paris Agreement. We are committed to 
using scientific guidelines and standards like Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to set greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions reduction targets and to deliver on our 
net zero ambition. In FY23, we strengthened our targets 
and enhanced our ambition by shifting from intensity 
targets to absolute targets for scope 3 categories 1 and 
11. This has been a transition from relative reduction 
measures to absolute reduction measures.3 
In this section, we highlight our FY24 efforts: 
Our emissions: We inventoried our greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions to understand our footprint and explored 
opportunities to reduce energy consumption and increase 
our use of renewables. 
Product energy efficiency: We focused on lowering 
the footprint of our products, including emissions from 
our upstream and downstream impacts, and providing 
solutions to increase efficiency. We aim to do this all 
without compromising the performance of our technology. 
Innovating to decarbonize: We explored solutions for the 
complex environmental challenges that come with digital 
transformations for our customers and society. 
Supply chain environmental impact: Our engagement 
program explored more specialized support to suppliers as 
they navigate challenges to deliver on their own reduction 
target roadmaps.

Decarbonize our operations, 
customers and society 
Our climate action strategy is comprehensive because we 
understand that no single solution will help us meet our 
climate goals. We incorporate carbon mitigation actions 
within our own operations, for our customers, partners 
and society: 
• Decarbonize Dell: We internally reduce emissions, 
implement operational resilience strategies and 
manage the carbon footprint of our operations and 
products. We also engage with our suppliers to drive 
down emissions upstream of our operations. 
• Decarbonize customers and partners: As part of a 
global technology chain, we support our customers’ 
and partners’ climate-related goals through 
breakthrough innovations. 
• Decarbonize society: Our support for global climate 
goals drives engagement and advocacy on climate-
related issues beyond our immediate community. 
We ensure that our emissions data is tracked, managed 
and reported over time. We calculate emissions in 
accordance with the methodology set out in the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol and follow industry best 
practices in terms of GHG accounting methodologies. We 
also align our emissions reduction key drivers to Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria. The ESG Goals 
and Key Drivers Methodology section contains additional 
details on how we measure progress to our key drivers. 
SCOPE 2 
Indirect emissions related to 
consumption of purchased electricity, 
steam, heating and cooling. 
SCOPE 1 
Direct emissions from Dell 
Technologies-owned and -controlled 
resources. 
SCOPE 3 
Indirect emissions associated with our 
supply chain, the use of our products 
by customers, activities like business 
travel and the transportation of goods 
and services. 
SBTi has validated our updated set of 2030 emissions 
targets and classified our scopes 1 and 2 ambition as 
in line with a 1.5 degrees Celsius trajectory for climate 
change, which is the most ambitious target companies 
can set for scopes 1 and 2 emissions. 
We continue to participate in the CDP Climate Change 
annual disclosure reporting our scopes 1, 2 and 3 footprint. 
We also ask and expect our suppliers to participate in 
CDP Supply Chain disclosure and to report their GHG 
emissions, reduction targets and mitigation plans. 
Public advocacy 
We continued to hold paramount our commitments to 
advancing sustainability in FY24, with a focus on climate 
action and circular economy. We realize partnerships and 
collaboration are key to making a sizeable impact in both 
areas. For instance, we joined our peers in engagements to 
educate key stakeholders, including policymakers, on the 
importance of urgent climate action. 
In FY24, we also: 
• Continued partnership with like-minded multinational 
companies as a member of  the World Economic 
Forum’s (WEF) Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders 
and participation in the WEF Climate Adaptation 
Community. Michael Dell signed the WEF business 
coalition letter in support of global climate action. 
• Took part in CDP’s 2023-2024 Science-Based Targets 
(SBT) Campaign. Campaign participants, which 
included financial institutions and other companies, 
were added to the CDP website and to a letter sent 
in October to over 2,100 CDP-targeted multinational 
businesses, a group that includes certain Dell suppliers, 
encouraging them to adopt SBTs. 
• Continued our membership in the Digital Climate 
Alliance and the GridWise Alliance. 
• Supported a letter through our membership with 
the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), urging the 
European Union’s co-legislators to set a common 
European standard for responsible business conduct. 
This would pave the way for a cross-sectoral and 
EU-wide level playing field for sustainability due 
diligence: the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence 
Directive (CS3D).

The Dell Technologies strategy to 
minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions resembles the carbon 
mitigation hierarchy: avoid, reduce, 
replace and — where these mitigating 
actions are not feasible — offset. 
• Avoid emissions from the start. 
• Reduce the energy intensity and extent of impacts that 
cannot be avoided. 
• Replace high-carbon emissions energy sources with 
renewable or low-carbon emissions alternatives. 
• Offset by investing in projects that remove or reduce 
emissions elsewhere. 
We annually inventory our GHG emissions to understand 
where we have opportunities to reduce our environmental 
impact. In alignment with our four 2030 key drivers toward 
our 2050 net zero goal, we focus on reducing emissions 
from our own operations and energy usage, those 
associated with goods and services we purchase and the 
use of our sold products. This inventory practice allows us 
to disclose our GHG emissions performance, management 
and progress toward our net zero goal.

Energy use and renewables 
We use energy to operate office and data center 
equipment, heat and cool our buildings and operate a 
small fleet of on-site security and maintenance vehicles. 
In addition to facility operations, our total energy 
consumption includes the estimated fuel used in vehicles 
leased by Dell. We maintain our ISO 50001 certification 
in Dell-owned manufacturing facilities through our 
commitment to efficient energy systems management. 
Global energy demand and costs continue to increase. 
Both contribute directly to our electricity consumption 
and renewable energy purchase strategy. Energy from 
renewable sources helps us transition away from 
carbon-intensive sources and reduce our emissions. 
We used renewable energy in the form of on-site solar 
generation, green power sources and unbundled and 
bundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) for our U.S. 
locations. As members of the RE100 initiative, we adhere 
to the group’s technical guidance on renewable energy 
procurement. In FY24, we sourced 61.5% of electricity 
from renewable sources across all Dell facilities. 
KEY DRIVER 
By 2030, we will source 75% of 
electricity from renewable sources 
across all Dell Technologies 
facilities — and 100% by 2040 
Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions account for a small share of 
our total footprint and represent the emissions in our 
direct control. Here we focus on emissions reductions in 
operations, including purchased energy. In FY24, scope 
1 and scope 2 (market-based) emissions accounted for 
172,400 MT CO2e. We have reported using the market-
based methodology since establishing a baseline in FY20.4 
Scope 1 includes direct emissions from Dell-owned 
and -controlled resources. Our main sources of scope 1 
emissions include transportation (company vehicles and 
aircraft), fuel use, back-up generators, natural gas use, 
refrigerant leakage from Dell facilities, mobile sources 
and offices.5 
Scope 2 includes indirect emissions related to the 
consumption of purchased electricity, steam, heating and 
cooling. Our main sources of scope 2 emissions are from 
electricity purchased for our facilities. 
KEY DRIVER 
By 2030, we will reduce scopes 1 
and 2 GHG emissions by 50%

Scope 3 emissions 
Scope 3 includes indirect emissions from upstream and 
downstream sources in our value chain. We identify scope 
3 emissions sources in accordance with the GHG Protocol 
Scope 3 Standard and perform extensive data collection 
for reporting requirements. We report emissions from our 
most significant scope 3 categories: purchased goods and 
services, upstream transportation, market-based energy 
activities and from the use of sold products. We also 
report emissions from business travel. 
Scope 3 emissions make up the largest portion of our 
Dell GHG inventory. Within scope 3, emissions that are 
associated with the goods and services we purchased 
(category 1) and those associated with the use of our sold 
products (category 11) are the largest contributors.6 We 
have the largest opportunity for emissions reduction in 
these categories and each are directly associated with a 
climate action key driver. 
Category 1 includes emissions from purchased goods and 
services. As done in our previous ESG reports, we provide 
scope 3 category 1 emissions with a one-year lag given 
the timeline of suppliers reporting their emissions data. 
For FY23, we reported our scope 3 category 1 emissions 
as 18,238,800 MT CO2e. This is a part of the dataset used 
to calculate the Dell GHG inventory. 
We continually refine our scope 3 category 1 emissions 
calculations by updating Dell’s quality controls and working 
with suppliers to receive more accurate data. Overall, these 
improve our calculations but can make year-over-year 
dataset comparisons challenging. We are initializing the 
process of re-baselining as part of our efforts to accurately 
measure our progress. 
Category 11 includes emissions from the use of sold 
products and accounted for 11,473,600 MT CO2e in 
FY24. This category contains commercial and consumer 
products including desktops, notebooks, displays, 
docking stations, servers, storage and networking 
systems. Customer use of our data center server 
products had the largest impact on our scope 3 category 
11 emissions and many of our innovations involved 
product energy efficiencies for data center hardware and 
software solutions. 
The amount of product that we ship is a large factor on 
our category 11 emissions. Also, emissions from the use 
of sold products contain several levers we have varying 
influence over, which can make year-over-year trends 
non-linear.7 Examples of levers in category 11 we have 
lower influence over are projected power consumption 
changes or the public grid energy mix. We continue 
to develop and implement initiatives where we have 
influence to reduce lever-type impacts on our category 11 
emissions. Examples of levers we have higher influence 
on are product efficiency designs and telemetry sourced 
from customer usage profiles. 
KEY DRIVER 
By 2030, we will reduce absolute 
scope 3 GHG emissions from 
purchased goods and services 
by 45% 
FY23: 18,238,800 MT CO2e.* We are in the process 
of restating our emissions for this category to make 
each year comparable and to provide a cumulative 
comparison to our FY20 baseline. 
The By the Numbers section of this report 
contains additional figures and information on 
GHG emissions. 
KEY DRIVER 
By 2030, we will reduce absolute 
scope 3 GHG emissions 
associated with the use of sold 
products by 30% 
 
  
  
  
22.2% 
reduction from our 
FY20 baseline 
*Due to the one-year lag in supplier emissions data, progress against the current

Product carbon 
footprint 
Product carbon footprint (PCF) is the 
aggregate of manufacturing, transport 
and usage emissions plus those related 
to end-of-life management. PCFs 
provide customers with insights for 
more informed purchasing decisions. 
We employ two methodologies to 
capture end-to-end PCF impact across 
our product portfolio: Product Attribute 
to Impact Algorithm (PAIA) and the Dell 
PCF Calculator.8 
PAIA is commonly used throughout the consumer 
products industry. At Dell, we use PAIA for servers, 
storage, networking and legacy client products built prior 
to CY24. We will continue to use PAIA for infrastructure 
solutions group (ISG) servers, storage and networking 
client products. 
The next step in our PCF calculation journey has been our 
development of the Dell PCF Calculator, which we have 
first applied to commercial client products. Several scope 
3 emissions categories align with PCF data, including 
purchased goods and services, transportation and 
distribution and use of sold products. 
Through our assessments and insights, we aim to reduce 
the carbon footprint of our products and solutions without 
compromising performance. We focus on reducing PCFs 
in four stages of the product lifecycle: 
• Manufacturing: We actively reduce emissions from 
the start by using recycled, renewable and low-
emissions materials. 
• Transportation: By optimizing logistics and giving 
preference to regional ground shipping, we reduce 
delivery emissions. 
• Energy use: We enhance efficiency in client 
solutions, servers and storage products to minimize 
energy consumption. 
• End-of-life management: We responsibly recover, 
recycle and reuse retired assets to contribute to the 
circular economy. 
More details on our work to reduce the impacts of our 
products throughout their lifecycles are in the Circular 
Economy section of this report.          
Product energy efficiency 
Eco label standards 
We adhere to international eco label standards that 
guide our industry in areas of climate, circularity, 
transportation and energy efficiency. Eco labels help us 
build trust through third-party validations and make it 
easier for customers and partners to identify our most 
sustainable products. 
Some of our products have earned ENERGY STAR® 
certifications and adhere to U.S. EPA energy-efficiency 
specifications. Over 500 of our computers, displays, 
enterprise servers, data center storage and networking 
equipment are ENERGY STAR-qualified. We also work in 
support of 80 Plus® , TCO and the China Environmental 
Label Program standards. 
We participate in the Global Electronics Council EPEAT 
eco-labeling program where over 330 of our products 
are EPEAT-registered and more than half of thoseare 
EPEAT gold. EPEAT has a range of criteria for products 
to earn its label. EPEAT also launched a Climate+ 
designation specifically for products that meet stringent 
climate-related criteria. The EPEAT Climate+ designation 
assures customers their purchases have limited impact 
on climate change. In FY24, we were recognized as 
an EPEAT Climate+ Champion and an early adopter 
of the climate change criteria with over 200 registered 
Climate+ products. A list of product names and gold, 
silver, or bronze and Climate+ designations are on the 
EPEAT registry.

Sustainable data centers 
We work to improve our products’ energy efficiency 
through hardware, software and tailored efficiency 
solutions. Our technology and services allow us to 
partner with customers on their journey to build modern, 
sustainable data centers. We optimize our data center 
technology for efficient energy performance in two 
main areas: 
• Our hardware is designed to deliver maximum 
performance per watt of energy used. 
• Breakthrough software solutions like OpenManage 
Enterprise (OME) Power Manager and CloudIQ provide 
energy management insights. 
The inefficient use of IT assets is a large source of 
excessive energy consumption in data centers. We have 
reshaped our understanding of thermals and cooling 
best practices over the years to help customers minimize 
energy waste. For example, by implementing variable 
speed fans and infrastructure purpose-built for higher 
temperatures, our customers can avoid over-cooling and 
waste less energy. 
To improve data center efficiency and performance and 
deliver value to customers, we combine several elements: 
• Audit infrastructure: We examine components for 
opportunities to minimize power demands. For 
example, we improve asset density to reduce floor 
space and the corresponding cooling required. Our 
OpenManage Enterprise (OME) power manager delivers 
telemetry to help lower the carbon footprint. 
• Right-sized footprint: By installing only necessary 
assets, our customers can reduce wasteful over-
provisioning. Right-sized IT assets either reduce the 
power draw for equipment, make the power draw 
efficient, or both. Dell’s PowerEdge power supply units 
(PSU) portfolio incorporates strategies to enable 
right-sizing of PSU capacity based on platform 
configuration and target workloads. Additionally, our 
APEX as-a-service (aaS) offerings provide customers 
with these right-sized IT resources and the ability to 
scale when needed. 
• Optimized HVAC functionality: We engineer new ways 
to reduce heat generated by our powerful machines 
through cooling systems and thermal advancements. 
For example, our EPEAT Climate+ PowerEdge servers 
with direct liquid cooling systems minimize energy 
needed to cool the data center and reduce reliance on 
HVAC systems. 
• Intelligent platform management: Our servers 
have built-in Basic Input or Output System (BIOS) 
and Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller 
(iDRAC) settings to manage off-peak power 
consumption. These intelligent platforms can also 
identify potential issues. 
• Optimized workload: Our data center solutions help 
manage workloads on premises and in the cloud. 
Customers that transition to high-density and energy 
efficient flash storage experience substantial enterprise 
data storage reductions. 
Learn more about how our Energy Efficient Data Center 
solutions are designed to increase efficiency while 
reducing energy costs and emissions.

Innovation is core to our leadership 
in the evolving digital transformation 
landscape. We continuously investigate 
sustainable solutions for the complex 
challenges that come with digital 
transformations — including optimizing 
energy efficiency and resilience. 
We highlighted two decarbonizing efforts in FY24. One 
involved customer data center efficiency and another 
related to the broader energy sector to expand our 
insights on grid resilience. 
Innovation 
Data center optimization 
Data centers are essential to business operations but 
require significant power consumption and energy 
budgets. We offer a Get Efficient Assessment to help 
customers understand the gains they could realize by 
transitioning to optimized data centers. In FY24, we 
performed over 700 assessments for customers of all 
sizes and from all segment types in the Asia Pacific-Japan 
(APJ) region. This region has substantial decarbonization 
opportunities due to its high energy intensities. 
Insights: Data centers are more efficient when assets 
require less power. Get Efficient helps assess if customers 
are right-sizing data center equipment to their needs, and 
using it effectively. Get Efficient Assessments contain 
details of optimized data center assets across core 
storage, servers, hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI), 
data protection services (DPS) and unstructured data 
solutions (UDS). 
Because of the complexity of these assessments, we 
developed an internal sustainability reporting dashboard 
that tracks and manages sustainable data center 
transformation details. Solutions for our customers 
vary based on their specific climate-related goals and 
challenges. With insights from our dashboard, we can 
provide accurate and tailored support to our customers as 
they decarbonize their IT. 
Grid resilience 
The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy 
(ACEEE) is exploring how optimized technology can reduce 
our collective energy intensity. We partnered with Intel to 
investigate two ACEEE emissions savings opportunities — 
one centered around grid resilience and the other around 
optimized electric vehicle charging. Emissions savings 
is the difference between baseline emissions and the 
predicted impact of an applied solution. 
Calculating the broader impact of products or services 
across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions is challenging. This is 
especially true for the complex upstream and downstream 
supply chain activities within scope 3. The solutions that 
we built following our work with ACEEE expanded our 
understanding of where we can integrate our technology 
within the grid and the magnitude of related emissions 
savings.9 Through our partnership, we found that the 
positive impact of both solutions can accelerate large-
scale decarbonization. 
Intelligent grid management 
• Approach: Grid management solution (GMS) 
for the utilities sector to optimize substation 
distribution. We investigated voltage and capacity 
management for industrial electricity user loads in a 
front-of-meter application.10 
• Insights: We built a GMS for more precise data 
monitoring, sharing and intelligent controls that 
helped reduce emissions on both the energy supply 
and demand sides. GMS solutions can support utility 
substation reductions in transmission and distribution 
line losses which improve efficiency and help match 
grid supply to specific load needs to avoid excess 
voltages. Maximizing asset utilization, incorporating 
distributed energy resources and increasing renewables 
can deepen these savings. 
Optimized EV charging 
• Approach: Electric vehicle (EV) fleet charging solution 
for the transportation sector to optimize depot 
charging. We investigated energy demand factors 
and schedule controls for EV depot charging used in 
commercial fleets in behind-the-meter applications.11 
• Insights: Our solution enabled emissions savings from 
optimized charging, but its application is limited by data 
availability. Reduced emissions were dependent on EV 
charging schedules because of the time-dependent 
differences in prices and emissions. Improved controls 
for schedules and capacity management are essential 
to manage costs, reduce emissions and ensure that 
electricity providers can meet demand. Programs 
for vehicle electrification and utility programming in 
support of EV buildouts are increasing. As they do, 
emissions savings calculations for fleet depot charging 
are valuable to decarbonize the transportation sector.

As exhibited in the GHG Inventory 
section of this report, scope 3 category 
1 emissions account for a large share 
of our carbon footprint. Emissions 
reductions in our supply chain have 
the potential to make a large impact. 
In FY24, we continued to prioritize our 
supply chain environmental programs 
and took steps to reduce GHG emissions, 
promote water stewardship and expand 
waste management systems through 
partnerships with our suppliers. 
Supply chain environmental 
management 
We actively engaged with experts and leveraged 
technology platforms to improve data accuracy with a 
centralized way to collect, analyze and report on supplier-
specific emissions data. We are committed to decreasing 
our carbon footprint and understand that supplier 
collaboration — both direct and indirect — is essential. We 
encourage our suppliers to: 
• Report scopes 1, 2 and 3 (category 1) emissions to CDP 
and join the CDP Supply Chain to engage respective 
upstream suppliers with the aim to reduce emissions. 
• Submit a letter of commitment to establish near-term 
targets with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 
net zero standard. 
• Publicly declare a target year for meeting or exceeding 
RE100 initiative expectations. 
• Reduce overall scopes 1, 2 and 3 (category 1) 
emissions from CY2020 Reporting. 
We encourage suppliers to periodically assess their 
challenges and partner with us to identify solutions.

Emissions and supplier 
engagement 
In FY23, we set a revised 45% absolute reduction target 
for scope 3 category 1. Our goal meets the Science Based 
Targets Initiative’s (SBTi) criteria for emissions reduction 
goals. We partner with our highest emitting suppliers to 
drive emissions reduction through our Emissions Supplier 
Engagement Program (ESEP). 
In the first phase of ESEP, the Procurement and Social and 
Environmental Responsibility (SER) teams engaged with 
suppliers and logistics carriers to understand their current 
emissions reduction initiatives and assess the best way 
to approach our program. We narrowed ESEP’s scope to 
focus on a subset of suppliers to prioritize the highest 
impact potential. Through our engagement, we gathered a 
better understanding of the following: 
• Data accuracy and availability: One of the challenges 
suppliers face in achieving requested emissions 
reduction commitments is data limitations that cause 
inaccurate reporting and benchmarking. 
• Commit status and gaps: Supplier maturity 
depends upon their emissions reduction targets and 
initiatives, which might reveal gaps against Dell’s 
commitment requests. 
• Partnership: Supplier feedback on the largest areas of 
opportunity is key to partnering with Dell on emissions 
reduction initiatives. 
The next ESEP phase includes more in-depth engagement 
and prioritization with our key suppliers, investing in new 
technologies and capabilities to improve automation and 
integrating solutions to streamline supply chain emissions 
data collection. Supplier emissions forecasting and 
enhanced hotspot analysis will drive tailored action plans 
and engagement strategies. 
Positive supply chain impact recognition 
In FY24, we received recognition for our efforts in 
sustainable supply chain environmental practices. The 
Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) ranked 
742 companies and Dell was one of only two companies 
to receive IPE’s Green Supply Chain Corporate Information 
Transparency Index (CITI) Master ranking.12 To achieve 
this, a company must rank as a top performance brand 
in the annual CITI ranking; maintain high performance 
standards in their supply chain environmental 
management13; and show that all key suppliers track their 
environmental performance through data systems. 
The IPE also recognized Dell as one of the top three 
scoring Climate Action Transparency Index (CATI). This 
score was based on responsive engagement in: supply 
chain transparency, compliance performance, green 
supply chain practices, energy conservation and emissions 
reduction efforts and levels of public disclosures. 
CDP annually evaluates corporate supply chain 
engagement on climate issues through its Supplier 
Engagement Ratings. In FY24, we maintained our 
recognition as a CDP Supplier Engagement Leader 
based on our efforts in the transition toward a net zero 
sustainable economy. Recognition criteria included 
assessing the level of climate performance within our 
business strategy; science-based target reporting; scope 3 
emissions accounting; supplier engagement levels; and the 
overall CDP Climate Change performance. 
Capstone research on public policy 
and supplier emissions 
In FY24, we partnered with the Columbia University 
School of International and Public Affairs for a 
capstone project to research policy analysis and 
regulations designed to incentivize corporate 
carbon emissions reductions in Southeast 
Asian countries. This research identified policies 
that offer cost-effective emissions reduction 
opportunities and government support for 
corporate decarbonization. The results also 
generated long-term practical insights on how 
suppliers can effectively leverage external policies 
to reduce their carbon footprint. 
Supplier emissions energy challenges 
The largest source of emissions often comes 
from suppliers’ own scope 3 category 1 
emissions, but these often take the longest 
time to reduce. Corporate decarbonization must 
make economic sense, with priority given to 
the most straightforward solutions that provide 
large emissions reduction across all scopes. 
Reducing scope 2 emissions is often the most 
straightforward and cost-effective option 
through renewable energy procurement and 
energy efficiency projects. However, a primary 
decarbonization challenge expressed by suppliers 
is lack of access to renewable energy due to cost 
and location barriers. 
The capstone project identified five types of 
policies that incentivize decarbonization for 
suppliers, depending on the markets or jurisdictions 
where they operate: 
1. Subsidies and Loans: Favorable interest rates 
and financing for certain projects that reduce 
carbon emissions. 
2. Grants: Funding awarded for renewable energy 
projects or for receiving verification of substantial 
progress toward achieving carbon neutrality. 
3. Power Purchase Agreements: Long-term 
contract between a customer and electricity 
generator to purchase renewable electricity at 
pre-negotiated prices (multiple schemes available 
depending on location). 
4. Carbon Tax Incentive: Government tax credits 
or special depreciation for purchase of assets 
that improve manufacturing efficiency or reduce 
carbon emissions. 
5. Foreign Ownership: Foreign investment and 
ownership permitted for renewable energy 
projects within specific countries. 
Capstone recommendations 
The capstone project recommendations support 
ESEP’s goal to educate and train suppliers on 
opportunities to decarbonize while ensuring 
alignment with economic benefits. Suppliers 
need customized planning support to identify 
decarbonization projects that leverage region-
specific policy incentives and emissions data 
platforms to explore reductions in their own supply 
chain. We will continue to monitor policy updates 
as a key driver for engagement with suppliers in 
our progress toward scope 3 category 1 emissions 
reduction key driver for 2030.

Energy efficiency capability and 
improvements 
We partnered with our suppliers on science-based 
emissions reduction strategies and building energy 
efficiency capabilities. In FY24, our supply chain energy 
efficiency program supported 67 suppliers with on-site 
technical advising that included: 
• Review of energy data and completion of gap analysis. 
• Analysis of direct feedback from internal surveys and 
prior on-site visits. 
• Review of energy management systems. 
• Proposal for energy-saving actions and energy 
efficiency best practices. 
We also helped suppliers investigate high energy 
consumption facilities and systems, like energy-intensive 
machinery. As part of this investigation, suppliers analyzed 
ways to reduce consumption levels through activities 
like implementing green modeling programs; introducing 
constant temperature-controlling engineering; recycling 
water; thermal insulation; and investing in robotic 
electricity-saving programs. 
As a result of the program, suppliers achieved the 
following outcomes: 
• Generated an energy management system that aligned 
with ISO 50001 and obtained third-party certification. 
• Set dated reduction targets with review cadences to 
monitor upstream and downstream progress. 
• Implemented energy-saving actions to reduce energy 
consumption and emissions. 
• Developed diverse energy-saving plans for continuous 
improvement. 
We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers to 
find more energy efficiency opportunities to advance 
sustainability and reduce suppliers’ operational impacts. 
Supplier water stewardship 
High-quality fresh water is required to produce some of 
the components in our products. Water stewardship, 
the responsible planning and management of water 
resources, is vital to manufacturing our products in 
a sustainable way. We understand that some of our 
suppliers operate in water-stressed areas where they 
may experience insufficient surface and groundwater to 
meet their region’s needs. 
Since FY21, we have worked with our peers in the 
Information Communications and Technology (ICT) 
sector to support suppliers to achieve continuous 
improvement. The Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) 
and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) develop 
shared assessment criteria aligned to the International 
Water Stewardship Standard to help suppliers 
understand their current performance level and build 
capability going forward. 
For our business, stakeholders include municipal water 
providers, local community members and the wastewater 
treatment plants within their respective factory water risk 
mitigation plans. For suppliers that have water-intensive 
processes or operate factories located in water-stressed 
areas, we partnered on the following: 
• Encouraged suppliers to use the ICT Water 
Stewardship Assessment to identify gaps and 
improvement opportunities within factories. 
• Provided consultancy and technical support 
to suppliers to develop and implement water 
management action plans. 
• Offered on-site training and coaching to water-
responsible members on topics of stakeholder 
engagement, supply chain water management and 
information disclosure. 
• Offered online training sessions on continued 
water management criteria from the ICT Water 
Stewardship Assessment. 
We submit annual responses to the CDP Water Security 
Report on our corporate efforts toward a water-secure 
future. CDP responses for FY24 are not available at the 
time of this ESG report publication but will reflect the 
following water stewardship figures: 
• 227 of our supplier factories implemented water 
management plans. 
• Our suppliers saved 86.1 million cubic meters of fresh 
water and reduced the amount of wastewater they 
discharged by 82.3 million cubic meters. 
For additional details on our water commitments and 
actions, please refer to Dell’s Water Policy Principles.

Zero waste in our supply chain 
Waste is a byproduct of our manufacturing process. We 
seek to reduce waste through our Zero Waste Program 
under our Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) 
business unit that measures waste generation and reports 
significant waste-related impacts. Our waste reduction 
reporting standards align with the  Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI 306). 
SER specialists help suppliers ensure safe disposal 
practices and reduce waste. We work with suppliers to 
identify alternatives to reduce or reuse waste that would 
otherwise be sent to landfills. We also conduct supplier 
trainings on industry disposal standards for solid and 
hazardous waste. 
Additionally, we expect our suppliers to align with our 
expectations for transparency about their environmental 
impacts by publishing sustainability reports in accordance 
with GRI. Through the Zero Waste Program, we help 
suppliers implement solutions that include composting, 
anaerobic digestion, incineration and other end-of-life 
recovery opportunities like reuse and recycling. 
Highlights from our Zero Waste Program in FY24 include: 
• Dell helped 21suppliers reduce the amount of waste 
disposed of in landfills. Supplier sites were chosen to 
support this program because they are key strategic 
partners of Dell. 
• 9 additional suppliers participating in our Zero 
Waste Program facilities received a UL2799 or TRUE 
certificate for their waste management system and 
100% diverted solid waste from landfills. 
• 89.9% of our direct material suppliers (by spend) 
reported sustainability initiatives in accordance with 
GRI standards. Based on this information, 54.8% of 
Dell’s direct material suppliers (by spend) reported 
progress in reducing waste from their operations. 
Hazardous waste 
Dell operates in a manner that protects the environment 
and prevents pollution, in accordance with our Global 
Environmental Policy. We comply with global and regional 
waste management regulations and are committed to 
minimizing the generation of both non-hazardous and 
hazardous waste throughout our value chain. 
The on-site recycling initiatives at Dell-owned facilities 
effectively reduce the volume of non-hazardous waste. 
The portion that cannot be recycled is responsibly 
disposed of by incineration or landfill. Waste is designated 
as hazardous based on applicable U.S., state, regional and 
local laws. At Dell, hazardous waste may include electronic 
waste, waste oil, damaged batteries, small amounts of 
solvents like paints, thinner, and cleaners and waste from 
facility lighting. These waste items are properly disposed 
of or recycled by qualified recyclers. For waste that 
cannot be recycled, disposal is in accordance with local 
environmental regulations. 
Globally, Dell generates minimal hazardous waste. In the 
U.S., we are designated as a very small quantity generator 
(VSQG) according to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency regulations on hazardous waste. All our Dell-
owned global manufacturing locations are ISO 14001 
Environmental Management System certified. Part of ISO 
14001 certification includes efforts to address and monitor 
hazardous waste. Dell adheres to local regulations on 
waste management in all regions where it operates. 
We also have Global Environmental Health and Safety 
(GEHS) Standards that all our locations must follow. There 
are GEHS Standards that specifically reference hazardous 
waste and the response to a hazardous substance 
emergency, for example, the GEHS-S1002: Chemical and 
Hazardous Materials Management or the GEHS-S1005: 
Waste Management and Waste Reduction Standards. 
Our EHS teams collaborate closely with our Facilities 
organization to oversee the management of hazardous 
waste across all Dell locations worldwide. 
By leveraging risk assessments and adhering to 
stipulations of our ISO 45001, and ISO 14001 
certifications and the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA) standards, we have minimized the amount of 
hazardous substances in our manufacturing processes. 
Dell follows the Clean Electronics Production Network 
(CEPN) process where hazardous chemicals are identified 
and systematically removed from production through 
elimination or substitution with a less hazardous chemical. 
More information on RBA, CEPN and our Chemical Use 
Policy is available in the Supply Chain Responsibility 
section of this report.

Advancing 
sustainability 
through circularity 
Our commitments to the circular 
economy power the creation of 
sustainable technology and solutions 
that drive business and society forward. 
Circularity as an economic system and product 
development process is integrated throughout our value 
chain. We embed it across the business and in deep 
collaboration with suppliers, customers and 
other stakeholders. 
Through our efforts and partnerships, we have recovered 
over 1.3 billion kg (2.8 billion lbs) of used electronics since 
2007. Building on over 25 years of experience in offering 
global recovery and recycling services, we are rethinking, 
redesigning, reusing and recycling our way to an even 
more sustainable future. 
Our approach to circular 
economy 
The progress we have made in our circularity practices 
helps us comply with evolving regulatory requirements. 
In adherence to the sustainable materials indicators in 
the Reporting Frameworks Index, we refined the scope 
of our circular economy goals in FY23. That refinement 
included expanding our product content goal to include 
materials produced using reduced carbon emissions 
energy sources. We also expanded our packaging goal 
to include where we utilize reused packaging — original 
packaging that has been recollected and reused. However, 
measurement and reporting capabilities for reused 
packaging are still in development and we now expect to 
reflect the expanded scope of this goal in future reports. 
Additionally, we updated the unit of measurement for our 
reuse or recycle goal, also known as our takeback goal. 
We now calculate the goal based on weight instead of unit 
count. These refinements increase the accuracy of our 
goal progress and are more aligned with broader industry 
approaches to these metrics. 
We aim to reduce e-waste and associated emissions to 
lower our environmental impact. To do so, we begin with 
low-emissions materials and then we reuse, recover and 
recycle as many products and components as feasible. 
In FY24, we made progress toward each of our refined 
circularity goals.

INTRODUCTION 

 
With our 2030 goals set, we focus on 
actions that drive progress in each area 
of our product lifecycle. 
We are designing end-to-end products that are cutting-
edge and easier to repair, recycle or upcycle in deep 
collaboration with suppliers, customers and other 
stakeholders to close the loop and reduce waste. The 
following details how goals align, by lifecycle stage, from 
product materials to end-of-life recovery and recycling. 
Product lifecycle 
Sustainable materials from the start 
We select sustainable materials that are across the spectrum of 
recycled, renewable or reduced carbon and ensure they are also 
recyclable at the end of their life. In FY24, we expanded our use of 
recycled, renewable and low-carbon materials like 50% recycled 
copper, recycled aluminum, steel and plastics. 
Sustainable packaging and transport 
When it comes to getting our products to customers, 
we increased the amount of recycled or renewable 
materials in packaging, offer multipack services to 
reduce packing material and offer lower-emissions 
shipping options. We continue to align to the Global 
Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) framework to 
reduce freight operations, optimize shipment options 
and overall transportation requirements by shipping 
directly from manufacturing facilities where possible. 
Innovative research, circular 
design and manufacturing 
Our designs aim to reduce waste and make 
service and repair easy. Our engineers work to 
refine modular designs for simple servicing, 
disassembly and repair. Many of these 
breakthrough designs are attributed to the work 
inspired by Concept Luna’s sustainable PC design, 
which was introduced in FY22 and has influenced 
future product designs. 
Increased repairability during use 
Once our products are in our customers’ hands, 
they need to be as energy efficient as possible, 
durable and easy to repair with readily available 
tools. Reducing the energy intensity of our 
products is critical to supporting our customers’ 
business and sustainability goals. Designing 
for more durability and easy repairability helps 
keep products in circulation for longer. With this 
in mind, we launched the Dell Self-Repair site to 
simplify upgrading or repairing Dell devices with 
an expanded number of parts available. 
End-of-life reuse, recycle and recovery 
What happens to our products when they reach the end of their life 
is important. Our recovery and recycling services offer customers 
seamless, secure ways to retire and recycle their products. This 
minimizes e-waste and reduces the demand for new raw materials. 
Through our takeback services, we recover retired IT equipment 
and prioritize reuse of products and components before recycling 
what remains.

Product design plays a significant role in 
reducing waste and emissions. Our aim 
is to keep products and materials in use 
for as long as possible, so we implement 
designs that allow our products to be 
more easily disassembled. This makes 
them easier to repair, refurbish, reuse 
and recycle. 
Circular design 
The strategy and evolution of 
design at Dell 
Since its introduction in FY22, Concept Luna has evolved 
into an inspiration and guidepost for Dell’s circular 
design approach. Our design teams gathered a wealth 
of knowledge and strategies during product prototyping 
that pushed the boundaries of what Dell’s sustainable 
technology could look like now and in the future. We 
continue to implement these findings in our products and 
further build our portfolio of innovative designs. 
However, we understand that creating a positive impact 
on the world is not something one company can achieve 
alone. We engage with others – including our competitors 
– to drive circularity at scale and maximize impact. Our 
memberships in influential cross-industry partnerships like 
the Circular Electronics Partnership (CEP) and NextWave 
Plastics are examples of this collaboration in action. 
Hosted by the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development (WBCSD), CEP brings together leaders from 
industry, international organizations and civil society. 
CEP facilitates global collaboration on an industry road 
map to overcome the barriers to a circular electronics 
industry. This includes improving product and supply chain 
circularity, and increasing awareness of the importance of 
circular electronics. 
In addition to our leadership and memberships, we 
increased our public advocacy efforts. We participated 
in stakeholder education on the importance of a more 
circular economy in the technology sector, including a 
May 2023 Consumer Technology Association Circular 
Economy panel and a similar panel at the 2024 Consumer 
Electronics Show. We continue to join efforts across 
industries towards building a more circular economy, 
which aims to eliminate waste while keeping resources 
and materials in use longer.

Circular design principles 
To accelerate the circular economy, we work towards design principles that consider sustainability 
throughout our process. 
Sourcing sustainable materials draws on 
recycled, renewable or reduced carbon 
materials for our product designs. We work 
diligently to ensure the materials we source 
minimize our impact on the environment. 
Examples at Dell include low-emissions 
aluminum in XPS laptops, recycled aluminum 
with low-emissions aluminum in Latitude and 
Precision products and recycled copper in the 
cables of some power adapters. 
Designing for parts harvesting or recycling is 
important to make it easy to recover parts and 
recycle materials from products that reach 
the end of their lives. Recycling materials 
uses less energy than processing virgin raw 
materials. Examples at Dell include clear 
labeling, easy separation of parts and material 
types, unified material grades and recyclable 
materials and working with recycling partners. 
Designing for durability creates longer-lasting 
products, which helps avoid or delay the 
environmental impact created by building new 
devices. Examples at Dell include improved 
water spill resistance, greater tolerance 
for shock and vibrations, wider range of 
temperature and humidity tolerances, better 
battery endurance and greater fault tolerance. 
Dematerializing and optimizing reduces 
needed materials or the impact of processes 
required to create products. Using fewer 
resources upfront preserves natural 
resources and reduces the carbon footprint 
of mining and manufacturing. Examples 
at Dell include designing for fewer internal 
components, lean manufacturing, passive 
cooling, paints, on-demand production and 
customer tools like virtualization. 
Designing for reuse and repair makes it easier 
to access and replace damaged or failed parts 
to extend product life. Reuse uses less energy 
than recycling, which further reduces carbon 
footprints. Examples at Dell include modular 
designs such as single-access service doors, 
eliminating the use of glues and creating 
upgradable or interchangeable parts. 
Evolving business practices by offering 
services and adjusting business models helps 
keep resources in the economy and out of 
landfills. Examples include as-a-Service (aaS) 
offerings, cascaded ownership (opportunities 
to remanufacture and reuse materials 
repeatedly), takeback programs, on-demand 
services and technologies to drive system 
change such as artificial intelligence (AI), 
machine learning and data analytics.

From our first use of recycled plastic 
and products in 2007 to our pioneering 
use of hydropower-produced aluminum 
today, we continue to invest in 
materials innovation. 
To support advancements in the circular economy, 
we have increased our use of recycled, renewable 
and reduced carbon emissions materials across our 
product portfolio. In FY24, we used over 43 million kg 
(95 million lbs) of recycled and renewable materials in 
products, or 14.1% total of our product materials goal. 
Product materials 
Closed-loop vs open-loop systems 
In an open-loop system, materials cross industries or 
functionality, like plastic recycled from water bottles for 
use in computers. In a closed-loop system, materials are 
recycled back into an item similar to the original, like parts 
from old hard drives used as stock for creating new parts 
for hard drives. Closed-loop systems are the backbone 
of a circular economy because they keep materials in 
use through recycling and reuse. We have closed-loop 
practices in our supply chain and products that contain 
closed-loop materials recovered from used technology.

Reducing and diverting e-waste 
Metals 
Using recycled metals, including steel, aluminum 
and copper, reduces our dependence on mining and 
processing new materials. 
• Recycled copper: Through FY24, we have 
shipped more than 1 million power cables with 50% 
recycled copper. 
• Recycled steel: We certified and established a 
baseline quantity of recycled content steel. In FY24, we 
used 50% recycled content steel in our displays, a first 
in the industry. 
• Recycled and low-emissions aluminum: We continue 
to expand our use of aluminum produced entirely 
with hydropower. We lowered our carbon footprint 
by integrating 50% to 75% aluminum produced 
using hydropower and/or recycled content in select 
notebooks. Hydropower reduces the emissions 
of aluminum material by up to 90% compared to 
traditionally coal-powered production process. 
Every pound of steel, aluminum and copper that we 
recover is a pound of material that does not need to be 
manufactured or mined. More information on Dell’s value 
chain approach to drive assurance across the IT sector, 
coordinate with industry groups to improve regulatory 
compliance and map suppliers for responsible mineral 
sourcing is available in the Supply Chain Responsibility 
section of this report. 
Renewables and reclaimed sourcing 
Our work with renewables helps us reduce our dependence 
on petroleum-based plastic. Renewable materials can 
be naturally replenished generation after generation. 
Renewable does not necessarily mean biodegradable or 
compostable, but they can be quick-growing. Certification 
programs through our partners affirm that our renewable 
sources are replenished. We strive to use renewable 
materials that are recyclable. 
• Reclaimed carbon fiber: We worked with our suppliers 
to recover carbon fiber from aerospace and other 
industries for use in laptop lids in our highest-volume 
products. In FY24, we used 492,250 kg (1.09 million lbs) 
of reclaimed carbon fiber in our products. 
• Bio-based plastic: Castor beans, tall oil and oils 
collected from methane-capturing processes are bio-
based alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. These 
are used in portions of the bottoms, lids and keyboards 
of some products. 
Plastic 
Our work toward reducing plastic use includes 
dematerializing, substituting and increasing recycled 
content in our products. Dematerializing is reducing the 
amount of material needed when creating a product, 
often by designing and manufacturing it in a less complex 
manner. We substitute plastic in products with more 
sustainable recycled or renewable materials. 
• Post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic: We use PCR 
plastic made from a variety of sources, like water jugs 
and single-use plastics, across our product portfolio. In 
FY24, we used over 22.7 million kg (50.1 million lbs) of 
PCR plastic.

Packaging optimization starts with the 
product. By making the product more 
durable, fewer interior and exterior 
packaging materials are required to 
protect it. 
Sustainable 
packaging 
Our exterior packaging ensures the extended system 
of shipping, storage and delivery has a small carbon 
footprint. The interior cushioning protects our products 
on the journey to customers. In this report, we refer to 
cushioning within the term packaging. We comply with 
multiple regional, state and country-specific packaging 
regulations. Our packaging materials adhere to various 
industry marking standards, eco label requirements — 
including restrictions on chemical use — and material 
recycled content and recyclability. 
Our 2030 goal for entirely recycled or renewable packaging 
materials content has been anchored on advanced 
engineering, simulation and material science. To progress 
in this space, we continue to implement creative designs 
and innovative sustainable materials while maintaining 
high levels of product protection for worldwide logistics. 
In FY24, we achieved 96.4% of our packaging goal. The 
recycled or renewable content was 122.4 million kg of the 
total 126.9 million kg shipped packaging material. 
Packaging methodology 
To streamline and improve our packaging methodology, 
we measured survey responses from packaging suppliers 
across multiple lines of business. We compared the weight 
of recycled or renewable materials manufactured for 
Dell-branded packaging with the total packaging material 
purchased in a given fiscal year. In FY23, we expanded our 
goal to account for where we utilize original packaging that 
has been recollected and reused. However, measurement 
and reporting capabilities for reused packaging were still in 
development during FY24. 
Natural material packaging 
Dell pioneered the use of natural materials in our 
packaging, like our bamboo and mushroom cushions. 
However, as we continued to enhance designs and 
dematerialize our packaging, we focused more on 
advancing molded fiber applications, eliminating foam 
and plastic bags and reducing packaging box sizes. 
Of the 126.9 million kg (279.8 million lbs) of shipped 
packaging, 93.7% was fiber-based and 6.3% is from 
plastic and other materials. 
Plant-based fibers 
Some of our packaging is created with a variety of 
renewable materials, including bamboo, recycled paper 
pulp and sugar cane fibers and sustainably sourced raw 
fiber. Our fiber is obtained from certified, responsibly 
managed forests that adhere to sustainable practices 
through the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC), 
the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest 
Certification® (PEFC), or the Sustainable Forestry 
Initiative® (SFI) sources. 
• Molded paper pulp reported by suppliers is made from 
100% recycled material. 
• Corrugate or fiberboard reported by suppliers is 
classified as renewable if it is certified through the 
FSC, PEFC or SFI. 
2030 GOAL 
By 2030, 100% of our packaging 
will be made from recycled or 
renewable material, or will utilize

Ocean-bound plastic 
We began using ocean-bound plastics in our packaging 
after rethinking the concept of waste, and how to address 
the developing demand for recycled plastics within the 
circular economy. In FY24, we also celebrated the six-year 
anniversary of founding NextWave Plastics in conjunction 
with the non-profit Lonely Whale and welcomed the 
new convening partnership of The Circulate Initiative 
to advance industry collaboration for healthier oceans. 
NextWave includes 15 member companies and a global 
network of ocean-bound plastic suppliers.15 Members work 
to decrease the volume of plastic litter entering the ocean 
by capturing it within waterways beforehand. 
Multipack solutions 
Multipack is a service offered to customers in select 
regions where multiple products can be packed into 
a single box, significantly reducing the amount of 
packaging materials needed for shipping. Customers 
that order products in large volumes of select 
notebooks, desktops and servers can combine several 
units in a single box. Dell multipack solutions have helped 
products earn EPEAT Gold certificate and offer the 
sustainability benefits of waste reduction through fewer 
packaging materials. 
Since its launch in FY22, highlights for multipack 
solutions include: 
• External shipping boxes made with corrugated 
fiberboard have up to 90% recycled content with the 
remainder of renewable content. 
• Select notebooks have up to a 34% reduction in 
packaging material weight, complete elimination 
of plastics with a 100% recycled and renewable 
corrugate design. Notebooks are 5 units in a single 
box for multipack. 
• Select desktops have up to 64% packaging material 
weight reduction when compared to single pack 
use. Desktop quantities per box differ based on form 
factors, with a range of 3 units in a single box to 8 
units in a single box for multipack. 
• For select servers, up to 98% recycled and renewable 
content, up to 58% reduction in packaging material 
weight and up to 2.7x reduction in logistics. Servers 
are 8 units in a single box for multipack. 
Multipack also simplifies the unboxing process. It is easier 
to manage multiple products in a single package, which 
reduces the time it takes to open and saves time when 
deploying and installing new equipment. 
Our packaging designs make it easy for customers 
to recycle the packaging they receive. We mark our 
packaging according to environmental and regulatory 
marking specifications and symbols that vary by region. 
Our site contains details on ways to dispose of packaging 
material through recycling and composting services. 
Our site also contains more information on how 
we are accelerating the circular economy with 
sustainable packaging. 
The NextWave initiative aligns with the U.N. Sustainable 
Development Goal (SDG) 14.1 indicator to conserve 
and sustainably use the oceans and other marine 
resources for development by preventing and significantly 
reducing marine pollution of all kinds, particularly from 
land-based activities. 
In 2021, four years ahead of schedule, we exceeded our 
commitment to increase our annual use of ocean-bound 
plastic tenfold by 2025. 
In FY24, we highlight that over 34,500 kg (76,000 lbs) of 
ocean-bound plastic were incorporated into new Dell-
branded product packaging. By using this waste material, 
we kept it out of oceans and in the circular economy where 
it can be recycled. 
Packaging material content weights are provided in Dell’s 
product-specific environmental datasheets.

Our services and solutions aim to extend 
the product lifecycle of a variety of 
equipment types, regardless of brand. 
Since 2007, we have recovered over 1.3 billion kg (2.8 
billion lbs) of used electronics. Our sustainability services 
support progress toward our circular economy goal that, 
by 2030, for every metric ton of our products a customer 
buys, one metric ton will be reused or recycled. In FY24, we 
progressed to 30.1% of this goal by collecting 91.6 million 
kg of 304 million kg products sold. Because our goal has 
extended to include products recovered by Dell partners, 
we are more aligned with the sustainability efforts in the 
collective circular economy and able to further scale our 
impact on product takeback. 
Recovery and 
recycling 
Data protection and security 
Services like Asset Recovery Services 
or Data Sanitization and Destruction 
Infrastructure Services provide secure and 
sustainable on-site and off-site solutions to 
safely sanitize or destroy data from customer 
equipment. Our processes are aligned with the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) SP 800-88 r1 standard for data 
sanitization. For more information, visit Media 
Sanitization of Data Storage Devices. 
Value recovery 
Through services like Asset Recovery Services 
we help customers resell retired equipment, 
getting the most value possible to reinvest and 
support business growth. Extending the life of the 
product is our priority — allowing for maximum 
value back to fund future technology. 
Partner management 
We operate under strict compliance with 
regulatory laws and regulations and require the 
same of our partners. We vet, audit and hold 
partners accountable to the highest ethical and 
environmental standards. Our partner standards 
apply to all recovery and recycling services and 
return streams supported by partners. Refer 
to our Dell Electronics Disposition Partner 
Performance Standard for more details. 
Environmental compliance 
In 2009, we were first in the industry to ban the 
export of nonworking electronics and e-waste 
to developing regions. We operate under strict 
compliance with regulatory laws and regulations, 
and we require the same of our partners. More 
information is provided on our Policies, Positions 
and Guidelines page. 
Responsible recycling 
Maximizing reuse is our priority. We thoroughly 
test returned equipment for functionality to 
minimize waste where possible. Many of the 
materials our business services recover are 
reused, while the remainder is responsibly 
recycled into the supply chain. For more 
information on our reuse and recycling of 
products and materials, see the Product 
Materials section of this report. 
We incorporate recovery and recycling services into our 
solutions by focusing on five key areas 
*In FY23, Dell expanded the scope of this goal to include products received by all channels, rather 
than products received by Dell-owned channels, within the reporting period. We also refined how 
we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of product 
sold (in metric tons). In previous reports, this metric was calculated as a percentage of units. 
In this report, we have restated FY22 and FY23 using this new methodology to present a more 
meaningful view of our progress.

Public advocacy 
We have deepened and expanded our public sector 
partnerships to help identify community-level needs at 
the intersection of broadband access, affordability and 
adoption. In the U.S., we have partnered with the private, 
public and nonprofit sector to raise awareness about the 
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) to help students 
and families cut costs and access affordable high-speed 
internet. The campaign provides training, funding and 
support to community-based organizations with local ties 
and outreach experience to drive enrollment. Additionally, 
our mission to support STEM education helps build 
innovative partnerships and programs like Girls Who 
Game, Student TechCrew, Solar Community Hubs and 
Develop with Dell. These programs help talent enter and 
re-enter STEM related jobs. 
In FY24, we also: 
• Joined the Online for All national campaign, a 
partnership between Civic Nation and the U.S. 
Department of Education to close the digital divide by 
focusing on internet access, affordability and equity for 
all Americans. 
• Were one of the Biden Administration’s corporate 
partners invited to the First Lady’s White House 
Celebration on International Day of the Girl. 
• Sponsored the National Digital Inclusion Alliance 
(NDIA), an alliance of digital inclusion programs, 
policymakers and thoughtleaders, in its annual 
awareness week promoting Digital Inclusion. NDIA 
advances digital equity by supporting community 
programs and equipping policymakers to act. 
• Attended the U.S. Department of Education National 
Educational Technology Plan Launch at the White 
House alongside the most prominent partners in 
education and technology. 
• Supported Camara Education, which works in 
partnership with the Government of Ethiopia to supply 
computers to schools and train teachers, often in 
rural parts of Ethiopia. This program aims to improve 
access to quality education through technology in 
disadvantaged communities in Ethiopia and to support 
the education sector in line with government strategies 
and policies. 
• Collaborated with India’s premier think tank which 
resulted in the adoption and establishment of Atal 
Tinkering Labs. 
Our approach to digital 
inclusion

INTRODUCTION 

Many of our programs and partnerships 
focus on preparing students and lifelong 
learners for the digital economy. Beyond 
providing access to technology and 
connectivity, these programs provide 
critical training and experience working 
with new technology. This enables 
communities to take the lead on their 
digital future. 
Community 
engagement 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for 
Workforce 
In 2023, Dell and the American Association of Community 
Colleges (AACC) joined Intel’s AI for Workforce program. 
This program supports an AI-ready future workforce 
and enables community colleges to be the first line 
for instruction and training of the U.S. workforce. In 
FY24, Dell provided additional funding for the AACC to 
manage and fund grants for AI for Workforce, which uses 
Intel’s curriculum to help students gain confidence and 
competency in AI. This funding allows AACC to work with 
individual community and technical colleges to tailor 
the curriculum to their needs, review grant applications, 
disperse funds and evaluate the effectiveness of 
the program. 
Mississippi statewide advancement of 
AI education 
In 2023, the Mississippi Artificial Intelligence Network 
(MAIN) announced a statewide collaboration to advance 
AI education. Founded in partnership with Dell and Intel, 
building on the AI for Workforce program, MAIN promotes 
AI training in all 15 community colleges in the state, as well 
as several Mississippi universities. Dell provided MAIN with 
specifications for campus AI labs. Local funding will allow 
MAIN partners to purchase technology for these labs and 
recruit students. 
According to data from AACC, 58% of the nation’s 10 
million community college students are women, 28% 
identify as Hispanic, 12% as Black and/or African 
American and 6% as Asian/Pacific Islander. Currently, 17 of 
the schools participating in the AI for Workforce program 
are classified by the U.S. Department of Education as 
Minority Serving Institutions. This new partnership will 
focus on minority serving institutions and Tribal colleges to 
support under-resourced communities. We are committed 
to continual growth of this program.

ShePreneur 
Dell introduced the ShePreneur program in FY23 to 
foster an entrepreneurial mindset and equip girls in India 
with essential skills in emerging technologies to solve 
local community problems. ShePreneur walks students 
through the entire development cycle of a product, through 
boot camps, internships, pitch deck events, product 
development and extended mentorship. 
ShePreneur has transitioned to focus participants mostly 
on AI skill building. The program widened its reach in FY24, 
expanding across India with most participants coming 
from and participating in remote towns. Students develop 
their solutions in teams, with access to brick-and-mortar 
Atal Tinkering Labs. Dell funded 310 of these labs, with 
more than 50 labs added in FY24. 
Girls Who Game - San Carlos 
Apache Tribe 
Girls Who Game (GWG) is a program created by Dell 
in partnership with Microsoft and Intel. In FY22, Dell 
partnered with Hesperus and the San Carlos Apache tribe 
to create the first Girls Who Game chapter on a U.S. tribal 
reservation. In FY23, the San Carlos Apache program 
expanded from one club of eight students to forty-four 
students across three clubs. 
This program demands thoughtful community 
engagement to develop an understanding of the unique 
needs of the San Carlos Apache tribe, especially as 
it relates to technology. Our approach is to engage 
with the community on its terms. From engaging with 
the community, we learned residents are concerned 
technology could threaten their heritage and way of 
life. With these needs in mind, the team formed a Tribal 
Advisory Council where community Elders advise the 
students on how to preserve traditional culture and values 
while the students develop social and technical skills to 
thrive in a digital world. 
As their GWG challenge, San Carlos Apache clubs are 
building a Minecraft model. This model captures the 
Apache way of life through a representation of cultural 
and historical aspects of the San Carlos community. 
This model, built in consultation with the Tribal Advisory 
Council, helps students better understand their cultural 
heritage and provides community Elders with an 
understanding of how digital transformation can help 
preserve their heritage and culture. 
*This goal aligns with both Cultivating Inclusion and Transforming Lives goal pillars by reaching 
those who identify as girls, women and underrepresented groups through our social and 
education initiatives. 
Each year through 2030, 50% of 
the total people directly reached 
will be those who identify as girls 
and women, or underrepresented 
groups

Global nonprofits must improve their 
operations through digital solutions 
if they want to scale their impact in 
a digital age. We are committed to 
closing the digital divide for nonprofits 
by partnering with NGOs, customers, 
peers and nonprofits to enhance non-
profit organizations through digital 
transformation and technology solutions. 
Global 
partnerships 
Junior Achievement 
Dell partners with Junior Achievement Americas (JA) 
to empower high school students to solve problems in 
their local community, teaching them the practical skills 
required to launch and manage a business. Across 15 
weeks, students work together to build a company from 
the very beginning, working with volunteer consultants 
to learn skills in marketing, finance, sales, manufacturing 
and operations. 
Prior to Dell’s partnership, participants managed all their 
data on paper or in spreadsheets. Local volunteers saw 
that information was lost or difficult to access precisely 
when it was needed. Our Dell team in Brazil built and 
launched Enterprise Space (EnS), a platform where 
students and volunteer consultants can manage all data 
and information related to their company. The program 
borrows from the gamification model, turning consultancy 
into a journey and allowing customization to mimic 
different business environments in different countries. 
During the creation of EnS in Brazil, the team understood 
that the program model must be adaptable to regional 
business environments. In the three years since its 
creation, JA and Dell have worked closely together to adapt 
and modify the initial program to continue scaling across 
the globe. In FY24, the use of EnS by the JA Company 
Program expanded, running today in 13 locations: 
Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and 
U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Since its launch in FY21, the partnership with Junior 
Achievement Americas has impacted over 250,000 
beneficiaries, including the students directly impacted 
by the program and the thousands of teachers, family 
members and volunteers who support them. 
Solar Community Hubs 
Our Solar Community Hubs connect people, even in the 
most remote communities. 
Solar Community Hubs provide access to technology, skill-
building opportunities and critical services and support. 
Depending on each community’s needs, these hubs can 
provide access to water and electricity, healthcare services 
and/or biodiversity preservation. They can be fixed form, 
portable or mobile depending on the size and requirements 
of the community. We partner with Computer Aid 
International, the N50 Project partners16 and local 
nonprofits to select the appropriate model and services for 
each hub. Currently, Dell has hubs in 48 locations. All hubs 
provide digital access through Dell’s end-to-end portfolio, 
with many featuring OptiPlex Micro Form Factor desktops, 
Latitude Rugged notebooks, PowerEdge Tower servers 
and N-series switches. 
Solar Community Hubs helped more than 2.4 million 
people in FY24. 
In FY24, Dell developed a Solar Community Hub in 
Kensington, a suburb of Cape Town, South Africa. By 
repurposing existing units and partnering with Students’ 
Health and Welfare Centres Organisation (SHAWCO), the 
Kensington Learning Lab is now a Solar Community Hub 
that offers a health clinic. Its multi-purpose rooms are 
equipped with Dell technology enabling health services 
such as health screenings. Hubs also offer educational 
services, including SHAWCO’s Beyond Educational Health 
Clinics and Violence Prevention Program. Additionally, the 
Hub offers ICDL certification, Microsoft Office training and 
coding training. 
In May 2023, we mobilized our N50 project partners to 
install 12 Portable Connectivity Centers (PCCs) across 
Ukraine, Poland and Romania to support refugees. 
Learn more about PCCs and our network of Solar 
Community Hubs.

Pro Bono program 
Dell has committed, by 2030, to use our expertise and 
technology to help 1,000 nonprofit partners digitally 
transform to better serve their communities. Pro Bono 
is a portfolio of programs that connect our talented and 
diverse employees with nonprofits around the world that 
need help on their digital transformation journey. To date, 
this program has helped 535 nonprofits, delivering over 
24,800 volunteer hours. 
To receive digital transformation support, nonprofits can 
be nominated by our employees or partners, or they can 
come to us directly. The Pro Bono program engages with 
nonprofits in a few ways: Pro Bono consulting workshops, 
Pro Bono projects and Board Service Matching, which 
matches Dell leaders with nonprofit board members to 
support nonprofits and increase leadership skills for future 
leaders of Dell. 
In December 2023, Dell hosted a Pro Bono Consulting 
Workshop for the Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) 
region, showcasing collaboration between our team 
members and nonprofit organizations. During the EMEA 
workshop, Dell brought together 96 team members and 
18 nonprofit organizations to exemplify the power of 
collective action. Among them, Al Jisr, an association 
dedicated to supporting public school children, sought 
assistance with digitizing 25 years of documentation. 
Our dedicated volunteers not only met this challenge but 
also coordinated the loan of a scanner/printer from our 
IT team in Casablanca, demonstrating our commitment 
to supporting nonprofits. Al Jisr significantly reduced 
search time, enhanced document accessibility and 
attracted investments from potential partners. Through 
this experience, volunteers gained valuable insights and 
reinforced their commitment to community engagement.

Technology has fundamentally changed 
the social needs of communities around 
the world. 
As populations grow and our reliance on technology 
increases, we must ensure society can keep pace. We 
are using technology to address systemic issues for 
underserved communities, supporting large-scale, partner-
led social programs through infrastructure support and 
creation of digital public goods.

Digital LifeCare 
Digital LifeCare is an open-source, digital healthcare 
platform created to help the government of India address 
the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) at 
population scale. It is a future-ready technology platform 
on which healthcare systems can be integrated digitally, 
enabling continuum of care for patients. Dell developed 
the platform in collaboration with India’s Ministry of Health, 
and the platform is implemented by Tata Trusts. 
In FY24, we added two additional local Indian languages 
to our health workers application, improving accessibility 
and user-friendliness. Additionally, community health 
officers and medical officers at primary healthcare centers 
can now download actionable reports, which improves 
program monitoring capability. 
Digital LifeCare was integrated into other National Health 
portals, enabling ecosystem collaboration and reducing 
the data entry burden for health workers. In FY24, Digital 
LifeCare deepened platform adoption across all levels of 
healthcare and ensured seamless delivery of care services. 
Digital LifeCare saw 81 million enrollments in FY24, up 
57% year-over-year, resulting in a cumulative total of 319 
million individuals enrolled across 33 states and union 
territories. 
The Digital LifeCare platform was recognized for 
Excellence in Digital Healthcare Project at the Elets 
Healthcare Innovation Summit, which highlights exemplary 
contributions to the healthcare sector. 
Digital LifeCare was also awarded the Best Tech for Health 
award by India Digital Summit, organized by the Internet 
and Mobile Association of India. Dell was recognized for its 
efforts helping the Indian government address the rising 
burden of NCDs by developing a future-ready technology 
platform for government healthcare officials and workers 
to scale their reach to millions of beneficiaries. 
i2B2 
The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside 
(i2B2) tranSMART Foundation has long sought to bridge 
the gap between medical research and patient care. 
For more than 10 years, Dell and the i2B2 tranSMART 
Foundation have partnered to use technology to develop 
highly personalized medical research and outcomes. 
Most recently, this partnership has focused on “digital 
medical twins,” which are simulations of patients that 
help researchers detect disease patterns and predict the 
effects of potential treatments. These twins are highly 
personalized to the patient and provide insights that 
facilitate precise recruitment of patients into clinical trials. 
Each digital medical twin is made up of several terabytes 
of data, which require robust technology solutions to 
process into actionable care plans. 
The digital medical twin database is built within a data 
enclave, pulling data from numerous hospitals and 
research studies. This enclave assembles data at various 
levels of de-identification from patients at participating 
clinical institutions, including lab values, medical images, 
data streams from monitoring equipment, text from 
electronic health records and genome sequences. 
As of FY24, the digital medical twin effort encompasses 
more than 2.1 million patients worldwide. 
Researchers can use digital twins to detect patterns for 
specific disease profiles, allowing them to move more 
quickly to identify, study and test treatments. Access to 
data from hundreds of millions of patients allows them to 
run simulations of possible treatments on an individual’s 
digital medical twin and compare it to others with similar 
conditions. 
The partnership improves treatment options around the 
globe by providing support to the below groups: 
• Researchers, who now have access to de-identified 
patient data in data enclaves. Digital medical twins 
facilitate collaboration with other researchers, resulting 
in quicker movement from research to application. 
• Providers, who could run treatment simulations for 
individual patients and practice precision medicine, 
based on data from over two million patients. 
• Patients, who are more likely to receive relevant, 
tailored treatments and who gain access to targeted 
clinical trials. Patients gain the ability to interact with 
their digital medical twin. 
We continue to develop digital medical twins and these 
data enclaves. We are currently developing how the use of 
generative AI might allow patients to provide feedback that 
will promote an unbiased and fair representation of their 
digital medical twin.

cultural understanding and communication, benefiting 
our team members both professionally and personally. 
Team members are able to join ERGs outside their 
backgrounds and interests to expand their awareness and 
provide opportunities to nurture supportive relationships 
with people from other backgrounds. In FY24, 56.4% of 
employees participated in at least one ERG. Participation 
like this demonstrates that our team members understand 
and value their role in creating community and a sense of 
belonging in the workplace.

Employee giving and 
volunteering 
A feeling of community, belonging and purpose extends 
beyond the four walls of the workplace. We make it 
easy for our team members to give back and maximize 
their impact, by matching donations up to $10,000 USD 
annually per team member per year and encouraging team 
members to volunteer during the traditional work day. 
Additionally, any team member who logs 10 hours or more 
of volunteering receives a voucher for $150 USD that they 
can donate to the vetted charity of their choice. 
In FY24, 48% of global Dell team members participated 
in giving or volunteering. In total, our team members 
volunteered approximately 949,000 hours of their time. 
Those hours were spent on community projects such as 
park cleanup and skill-based work through the Pro Bono 
program. Read more about Pro Bono and our Giving 
and Volunteering goal in the Digital Inclusion section of 
this report. 
Learning programs and training 
Giving all team members a strong educational foundation 
around inclusive practices allows everyone to utilize a 
common language and a shared understanding. 
Be the Change is Dell’s foundational learning program 
focused on topics related to inclusion. This training 
helps cultivate an inclusive environment where all team 
members can be their authentic selves and thrive in 
their careers. To date, 99% of our team members have 
completed Be the Change. All new team members and 
managers complete this foundational training as a part of 
onboarding. Be the Change provides tools and resources 
to encourage collaborative conversations across all teams, 
levels and business areas throughout the year. In FY24, 
we launched the next evolution of Be the Change modules 
focused on allyship for team members and leaders. 
Disability inclusion 
One way we foster inclusivity for Dell team members 
with visible and invisible disabilities is through our Centers 
of Excellence. 
Dell’s Assistive Technology Center of Excellence (CoE) 
aims to provide every team member with the assistive 
technology they need to reach their full potential. The 
vision of the center was brought to life in FY22 through 
a partnership with Dell’s True Ability Employee Resource 
Group. The Assistive Technology CoE provides technology, 
training and support for team members with disabilities. 
Any team member can confidentially request assistive 
technology without manager approval, funding or medical 
verification. The Assistive Technology CoE offers a catalog 
of hardware and software including braille keyboards, 
auditory individualization software, speech-to-text tools 
and screen readers. 
While our Assistive Technology CoE strives for all Dell 
team members to have the technology they need to 
excel in their roles, our Accessibility Center of Excellence 
works to ensure that our digital products and resources 
are accessible to those who have a disability and/or use 
assistive technology. Our Accessibility Center of Excellence 
provides a range of services to help product teams comply 
with Dell’s Accessibility Statement. The Accessibility team 
also provides accessibility education, accessibility testing, 
reviews and audits and tools to promote accessible design 
and inclusive language. 
As new team members join Dell, our onboarding offers 
a thorough understanding of our culture and inclusive 
workforce goals. We do this by providing the following 
during onboarding: 
• Be the Change foundational learning. 
• Equal Employment Opportunity policy. 
• Information around ERGs, networking and mentorship. 
All team members must abide by our Code of Conduct 
and complete our annual Ethics and Compliance training. 
Read more on our annual training in the Ethics section of 
this report.

Compensation and benefits 
We offer a competitive and comprehensive benefits 
package and strive to provide our employees the best 
choice and value at the best cost. Through our benefits 
package, we support our employees’ overall health and 
well-being through a comprehensive approach which 
provides programs and resources focused on mental, 
physical and financial health, flexibility and connection. 
Work flexibility is part of our culture and remains a priority 
for us, and we have built tools that provide choice and 
flexibility to employees. We aim to provide innovative and 
inclusive offerings, such as virtual live and on-demand 
educational sessions, counseling and support services, 
fitness and wellness challenges, voluntary progress 
tracking and other incentives. 
We have designed our comprehensive rewards programs 
to be globally consistent, locally relevant and effective in 
attracting, motivating and retaining high-quality talent. 
Our rewards programs seek to inspire employees to do 
their best work for our customers and the growth of 
our business. Through our rewards programs, we are 
committed to equal pay. Read more about our pay equity 
efforts in the Accountability section of this report. 
Employee health and safety 
We aspire to provide an occupational injury-free and 
occupational illness-free workplace in all of our operations 
around the world. This objective can be achieved by 
maintaining a world-class health and safety culture that is 
embraced by our employees, contractors and visitors, and 
that is fully supported by all levels of the organization. The 
framework and criteria for establishing and reviewing our 
occupational health and safety objectives are outlined in 
our Global Health and Safety Policy. 
Dell’s occupational safety, health and environmental 
programs are managed by a global staff of qualified EHS 
professionals. All of Dell’s manufacturing sites worldwide 
are certified to the globally recognized ISO 45001 
Occupational Health and Safety Management System 
and the standards of the Responsible Business Alliance, 
which includes stringent health and safety requirements. 
A robust audit program conducted both internally and by 
third-party accreditation bodies at Dell’s manufacturing 
facilities ensures that workplace health and safety are 
managed and maintained to the highest standard. 
Dell maintains an internal-only Occupational Health and 
Safety Management System (OHSMS) manual. Dell’s 
operations and businesses have earned ISO certifications 
in a number of important areas, including quality, 
environmental, occupational health and safety, energy and 
others. For a full list, see our Certifications and Ecolabels.

Dell aims to attract, develop and retain 
an inclusive workforce by investing in 
our team members through internal 
career advancement and development. 
We provide access to career and 
growth opportunities for all our team 
members, including women globally and 
underrepresented groups in the U.S. We 
also focus on hiring veterans, people 
with career gaps and those who are 
neurodiverse. 
We continue to innovate our hiring programs and 
processes and remove barriers to inclusion by evaluating 
and improving our accessibility practices and retention and 
development processes. We are committed to building an 
inclusive workforce. 
This commitment is the motivation behind our 2030 
Cultivating Inclusion goals: 
• By 2030, 50% of our global workforce and 40% of 
our global people leaders will be those who identify 
as women. 
• By 2030, 25% of our U.S. workforce and 15% of our 
U.S. people leaders will be those who identify as Black/ 
African American or Hispanic/Latino. 
Workforce 
Talent recruitment and hiring 
We leverage traditional, innovative and targeted recruiting 
and hiring programs to attract the best talent possible. 
This includes creating on-ramps and training programs, 
such as Career ReStart and Reboot, for those interested in 
returning to the workforce. 
We recognize that life is bigger than work. Sometimes 
life calls even the most committed professionals away 
from their careers temporarily. Whether someone leaves 
the workforce to start a family, care for aging parents, 
manage an illness, complete academic study, or any 
other reason, Dell knows career gaps happen. The 
Career ReStart program helps well-qualified, experienced 
professionals with significant career gaps restart their 
careers by providing the structured support, mentorship, 
training and networking they need. Career ReStart consists 
of two programs: 
• Direct Hire program: Accelerates transition back to the 
workforce with structured onboarding and support. 
• Returnship program: Offers training, professional 
development and support. This program runs in several 
regions including France, Germany, India, Ireland and 
the U.S. 
As a further commitment to recruiting and attracting 
talent, we provide mentorships to women pursuing STEM 
degrees. According to data from the 2023 World Economic 
Forum Global Gender Gap Report, representation of 
women graduating with STEM degrees has remained 
stagnant year over year. We encourage more young 
women around the world to stay in their STEM degree 
programs through our STEM Aspire mentorship initiative. 
Partnering with our Women In Action ERG, we align 
mentors to young women in STEM degree programs. 
This program currently exists in Australia, Brazil, Egypt, 
India, Ireland, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, the United Arab 
Emirates and the United Kingdom. 
We partner with historically Black colleges and universities 
(HBCUs), minority-serving institutions (MSIs), Hispanic-
serving institutions (HSIs) and community colleges 
through programs that include curriculum, internships and 
employment opportunities, such as our Changing the Face 
of Tech (CFT) initiative. 
Changing the Face of Tech is a network of programs 
that focuses on attracting and empowering talent from 
diverse backgrounds in order to expand the standard pool 
of candidates for recruiting and establishing a diverse 
workforce. We’re Changing the Face of Tech by: 
• Introducing students to tech: We partner with select 
HBCUs, minority-serving institutions, Hispanic-serving 
institutions and community colleges to take learning 
beyond the classroom with immersive and engaging 
in-person workshops on topics like sales engineering, 
cybersecurity and data science. 
• Providing training and certifications: We work with 
students throughout their post-secondary education 
to provide free access to world-class training. In these 
programs, students can gain skills through hands-
on workshops, learn more about technology career 
opportunities from professionals of color and earn 
credentials that elevate them as prospective hires. 
• Offering our Dell Intern Scholars program: The Dell 
Technologies Intern Scholars Program is a multi-year 
internship experience for students who self-identify as 
Black/African American and/or Hispanic/Latino and 
who study computer science, supply chain, business, 
marketing or engineering. This program provides 
students the opportunity to build soft skills as well 
as business acumen through various learning and 
development programming. 
In addition to Career ReStart and Changing the Face of 
Tech, other hiring programs at Dell include initiatives 
focused on individuals with disabilities and those 
who are neurodiverse, LGBTQ+, veterans and other 
underrepresented minorities. We are proud of our hiring 
initiatives and their impact on our talent pipeline. 
We are also continually reviewing and refreshing our 
policies to encourage equity throughout the hiring 
process. Our commitment to diverse communities is 
robust and we are proud of our global teams for their 
dedication and focus.

Talent retention and 
development 
Talent development is key to talent retention. We have 
invested in tools and resources that are designed to 
empower and inspire employees to direct their own 
career paths and build a portfolio of transferable skills in 
the technology industry. We are committed to building a 
diverse leadership pipeline with a broad spectrum of skills, 
including the ability to act with integrity and inspire others. 
We provide many resources to support employees’ career 
growth and development through a centralized program. 
Through this program, we offer formal training options, 
individualized development programs, tools for 360-degree 
feedback, mentoring, networking, stretch assignments 
and growth opportunities. Our internal Career Hub 
supports employee growth by providing personalized 
development suggestions, such as mentorship and 
internal opportunities, that align with their skills and 
development goals.

Through our continuous listening strategy 
and robust governance and oversight 
for our Culture, Diversity and Inclusion 
(CD&I) work, we are committed to holding 
ourselves accountable for upholding Dell’s 
Culture Code and People Philosophy. 
Accountability 
Continuous listening strategy 
Accountability requires awareness. We have developed 
a continuous listening strategy that captures feedback 
from team members at regular intervals throughout the 
year. This strategy helps us better understand our culture, 
potential risks, growth opportunities and areas in which we 
are already performing well. 
Each year, we ask our team members to complete our 
annual employee engagement survey, Tell Dell, which 
helps us assess the application of our Culture Code and 
People Philosophy and helps us capture our Employee 
Net Promoter Score (eNPS). Tell Dell also serves as a 
critical tool for leader accountability, as all eligible leaders 
receive a report of their team’s results from the Tell Dell 
survey, which also includes a new Leader Net Promoter 
Score (LeaderNPS). The LeaderNPS indicates how likely 
a team would recommend their leader. We recognize 
leaders with high Tell Dell scores, and HR consultants work 
to build action plans with any leader who does not meet 
internal threshold scores. For all leaders, we encourage 
transparency. We ask all leaders to review their Tell Dell 
results, recognize areas of strength and opportunity and 
have conversations with their teams to determine next 
steps for improvement. 
We distribute three other quarterly surveys throughout 
the year. In addition to Tell Dell, we send out pulse surveys 
in Q1 and Q3. These pulse surveys are more targeted 
surveys sent to a smaller sample of our team members. 
Pulse surveys focus on select topics, helping us better 
understand results from the Tell Dell census or other topics 
important to leadership. In FY24, these topics included 
hybrid workplace and team member perceptions around 
AI. Additionally, in Q4, we distribute our Tell Dell Check-In 
survey to a representative sample of approximately half 
of our team members. This offers another snapshot of 
our eNPS and helps us further understand how our team 
members view leadership and how well we are upholding 
our Culture Code and People Philosophy. 
Our Listening Strategy also includes roundtables and 
listening sessions, which our leaders host with select 
groups. Additionally, we distribute automated surveys 
throughout the lifecycle of a team member’s tenure at Dell, 
including during the candidate experience, onboarding, 
entry into leadership roles and voluntary exit from Dell. 
This lifecycle process helps us understand employee 
perceptions during key milestones. 
Culture, diversity and inclusion 
governance 
Dell has dedicated resources and teams in place to drive 
its CD&I initiatives. Valuing diversity and inclusion is a 
critical element of our culture. Dell has been advocating 
for and championing inclusion for many years, hiring our 
first Diversity Officer in 2000. Dell’s current Chief People, 
Culture and Inclusion Officer (CPCIO) leads the CD&I 
and Talent organizations, reporting to the Chief Human 
Resources Officer. 
Our Global Diversity Council, chaired by Michael Dell, 
consists of senior leaders from across the business. 
The Council provides accountability and strategic support 
and direction through regular tracking, discussion and 
review of progress toward goals and actions for 
areas of opportunity. This further underscores our senior-
most leaders’ commitment to building a diverse and 
inclusive culture. 
Senior leaders across the organization are held 
accountable to drive progress toward our 2030 
representation goals. All leaders are responsible and 
accountable for inclusive leadership through our Culture 
Code leadership principles and People Philosophy leader 
expectations. We work to help our leaders understand their 
role in activating achievement, balance, connection and 
diversity and inclusion for their team. 
Our CD&I investments extend beyond our workforce and 
include community involvement, partnerships, councils, 
coalition sponsorships, memberships and public policy 
actions. We recognize we must represent and advocate for 
the change we want to see in the broader industry to be 
credible and most impactful. 
Pay Equity 
At Dell Technologies we believe people should be equitably 
compensated for the value they deliver to our customers 
and stakeholders, no matter their gender, ethnicity or 
other factor. We routinely review salaries — and make 
adjustments if needed — to ensure we pay employees 
consistently when compared to peers and the relevant 
compensation market.

leadership opportunities for diverse talent, 
to respect human rights and accessibility 
for all and to increase our impact in the

Dell is also a member of several inclusion-related councils 
and coalitions. We are a founding member of the Alliance 
for Global Inclusion, a coalition of companies launched in 
2021 that is committed to providing tangible, innovative 
solutions to historical shortcomings in diversity, equity 
and inclusion. We are also a long-standing supporter 
of Catalyst, a nonprofit that brings together a global 
community of 500+ companies to learn and share leading 
practices and help build workplaces that work for women. 
Our Chairman and CEO Michael Dell is a Catalyst CEO

Human Rights
Dell Technologies respects the fundamental human rights of all people. This respect is 
core to our commitment to drive human progress. 
We have adopted and uphold expectations set out in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, to which Dell is a signatory. We align our policies and 
practices to these principles. Dell is committed to ensuring we are not complicit in human rights violations, and we hold 
our suppliers and other business partners to this same standard. 
We respect and 
support the 
internationally 
recognized human 
rights of all people 
Our approach to human rights 
We believe everyone deserves to be treated equally, with 
dignity and respect, and we are committed to responsible, 
ethical, inclusive and sustainable business practices. 
The Dell Human Rights Policy reflects our global 
commitment to respect the rights of all our stakeholders, 
including Dell team members, suppliers, contractors and 
subcontractors at any tier, partners, resellers and others 
impacted by our value chain. 
The Dell Human Rights Policy confirms our alignment 
with expectations of the U.N. Guiding Principles. We have 
also formalized and embedded other policies, human 
rights due diligence and governance protocols throughout 
our business. These are addressed in the Dell Human 
Rights Policy. 
Operational oversight 
Effective human rights governance requires an 
integrated approach. We prioritize executive leadership 
and maintain dedicated subject matter engagement 
on the most salient risk areas across our value chain. 
In FY24, we established our Human Rights Advisory 
Committee, a cross-functional coalition of executives 
who lead organizations responsible for human rights 
due diligence and governance of salient risks and impact 
priorities. The Human Rights Advisory Committee 
supports Dell’s formal corporate human rights strategy 
and ensures operational accountability for human rights 
governance across Dell’s own operations and value chain.

of Directors, ESG Steering Committee and ESG Interlock

Salient risks 
In addition to ongoing human rights due diligence and 
assurance practices embedded in organizations across 
our business, we also periodically engage third-party 
experts to conduct human rights impact assessments 
(HRIAs) to ensure and advance our understanding of 
human rights risks and impacts. These assessments 
inform Dell policies and support our risk mitigation, 
governance practices and strategic priorities. 
Our first corporate-level third-party HRIA, completed in 
FY19, confirmed our awareness of salient human rights 
risks and impact areas and that we have the essential 
structures in place to monitor and address our most 
significant risk areas. Insights from our most recent third-
party HRIA, completed in FY24, deepened, increased and 
expanded our understanding of current, new and evolving 
salient risks. It continues to inform and strengthen our risk 
mitigation strategies and governance practices. 
We remain dedicated to continually increasing our 
understanding and effective mitigation of actual, potential 
and emerging risks and identifying opportunities to 
accelerate positive impacts. The ongoing effectiveness 
and evolution of our human rights strategy is built on 
identifying opportunities to realize positive impacts and 
address risks. 
This table provides an overview of the most significant 
human rights impact areas across our value chain, 
respective governing policies and expectations. It also lists 
additional resources and references that further address 
these topics.

Employees 
Expectations to comply with laws and ethical business 
practices, including acting with integrity and respecting 
the fundamental human rights of others, are embedded 
in the Dell Technologies culture and policies and clearly 
set out in the Dell Technologies Code of Conduct. Dell 
team members are required to complete annual Code 
of Conduct training and adhere to our code and policies, 
including the Dell Human Rights Policy and standards that 
flow from it. Annual Code of Conduct training also includes 
workplace health and safety requirement reminders. 
For FY24 updates and additional insights on our team 
member commitments and expectations, refer to the Trust 
section of this report. 
Supply chain 
Dell is a founding member of the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA), which embeds requirements to uphold 
respect for human rights in the RBA Code of Conduct. Dell 
adheres to these standards and also expects its suppliers 
to comply with the RBA code and other requirements set 
out in our Dell Supplier Principles. 
Dell does not tolerate forced labor or child labor in any 
form. We undertake due diligence to assess and address 
risks of modern slavery in our supply chain and report 
on these priorities and progress in our annual Statement 
Against Modern Slavery, Human Trafficking, and Child 
Labor. Our global commitment to respecting human rights 
also extends to the responsible sourcing of materials used 
in our products and is underscored in the Dell Responsible 
Sourcing Policy. 
Comprehensive insights on our responsible labor and 
supply chain standards, governance practices and 
progress are addressed in the Supply Chain Responsibility 
section of this report. 
Resellers and other third parties 
We expect our resellers and other third parties to maintain 
a culture that embraces diversity, equity and inclusion and 
respects cultural differences, while operating at the highest 
level of integrity and accountability. These expectations are 
clearly defined in the Dell Technologies Code of Conduct 
for Partners. 
Collaboration 
We value engagements with, and insights from, 
stakeholders across our business and value chain. We 
also believe some human rights issues can be addressed 
most effectively by working in partnership with others. 
To drive progress on complex challenges, we collaborate 
with suppliers, business partners, customers, local 
communities, industry and cross-sector working groups 
and other organizations. We seek and leverage external 
stakeholder feedback collected by third-party human 
rights experts engaged to conduct our periodic HRIAs. We 
utilize insights and guidance from Article One Advisors 
and actively participate in the BSR (Business for Social 
Responsibility) Human Rights Working Group.

Supply chain 
responsibility 
As a global company, we engage a vast 
supplier network that faces complex 
sustainability challenges. We embrace 
and address these challenges because 
they bolster our resilience by helping us 
learn, adapt and grow. This approach 
has allowed us to build one of the most 
dependable and durable supply chains 
in the industry. Our enduring dedication 
to sustainability is a key factor in our 
continued success. 
Executive Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer 
Kevin Brown leads Dell’s global supply chain and the 
Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) assurance 
program that underpins our approach. The SER assurance 
program is one of the largest in the technology sector. It 
proactively recognizes and tackles issues within both Dell-
owned factories and those of our suppliers, including final 
assembly, direct and sub-tier suppliers.17 
As a condition of doing business with Dell, we require 
all partners and suppliers to adhere to Dell’s Supplier 
Principles, which provide the basis for our SER program. 
We prioritize human rights and environmental issues, 
leveraging our operations experience and collaboration 
with industry partners to promote responsible 
manufacturing, diversity and inclusion. Our expectations 
of Dell’s suppliers for responsible and ethical business 
practices are informed by international standards, 
including the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, the United Nations Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations 
Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant 
U.N. conventions. 
Adherence to our Supplier Principles is a condition of 
doing business with us, and it forms the basis for our 
social and environmental due diligence programs. We 
work closely with our suppliers to help them develop 
the necessary insights and capabilities to meet these 
requirements. Our collaborative supplier relationships 
help to ensure our supply chain remains one of the most 
trusted in the industry. 
It takes hundreds of thousands of people worldwide to 
make our products. We are committed to partnering with 
our suppliers to respect human rights for all workers in our 
supply chain. This includes treating all people with respect 
and dignity, not tolerating forced labor in any form and 
consistently providing safe working conditions.

Continuous improvement model 
Our suppliers demonstrate varying levels of maturity in their own corporate 
sustainability programs. We work closely with them to drive progress and 
continuous improvement. 
We use a four-element approach in our SER audit program. This continuous 
improvement model is a framework for advancing supplier performance 
that includes risk assessments, supplier audits, corrective action plans and 
capability building.  
Risk assessments 
Our engagement with suppliers at any tier – including final 
assembly, direct and sub-tier – begins with an assessment 
of their social and environmental risks. We conduct rigorous 
initial risk assessments of suppliers before starting a 
business relationship, and we refresh those risk levels every 
year through internal tools and processes. 
We share SER performance metrics alongside other key indicators, such as 
cost and quality, as part of our supplier quarterly business reviews (QBRs). Key 
executives attend QBRs, help determine future business awards and address 
progress toward aligned goals. 
In FY24, 63% of final assembly, direct and sub-tier suppliers improved their 
audit scores between audit cycles18, which illustrates the effectiveness of our 
continuous improvement model. 
Supplier audits 
The Dell audit program is one of the largest in the technology 
sector, both in the number of audits conducted and 
reach across the supply chain. It is designed to identify 
sustainability risks in our supply chain and enable suppliers 
to both mitigate issues and build their SER capabilities. In 
addition, we engage our suppliers in targeted assessments 
and programs to drive more opportunities for improvement. 
Corrective action plans 
When areas of nonconformance with the Responsible 
Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct are 
discovered through an audit, our Dell SER specialists work 
with the supplier to create a corrective action plan (CAP) 
to resolve the issues within RBA- or Dell-defined timelines, 
whichever is earliest. 
Capability building 
We share best practices collected from our highest 
performing suppliers and encourage lower-performing 
suppliers to take appropriate actions to improve performance.

Social and environmental risk 
assessment 
Our engagement with all tiers of supplier — including final 
assembly, direct and sub-tier — begins with an assessment 
of their social and environmental risks. During our 
onboarding process, and prior to commencing a business 
relationship with a supplier, we conduct a rigorous initial 
risk assessment. 
In addition, we evaluate suppliers’ sustainability risk levels 
every year through our internal risk assessment tool and 
calibrate using a supplier self-assessment questionnaire 
(SAQ) to determine risk level using criteria such as: 
• Geographic location: Considers regional risks 
around social concerns, such as child labor and forced 
labor, and environmental risks, such as water quality 
and air pollution. 
• Commodity: Considers specific risks associated with 
manufacturing, such as labor intensity, manufacturing 
processes and paints or chemicals involved in the 
production of a commodity. 
• Prior responsible manufacturing performance: 
Includes previous audit results and participation in our 
capability-building efforts. 
• Additional insight: Refers to information obtained by 
Dell team members during regular and unannounced 
factory visits or from independent sources, such as 
regulatory and third-party organizations. 
Based on the results of the SAQ and additional insight, we 
classify suppliers as low-, medium- or high-risk. Suppliers 
deemed high-risk must complete a third-party audit that 
determines conformance with the Responsible Business 
Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. In addition, we audit a 
portion of medium- and low-risk strategic partner suppliers 
to determine if their risk is rising. 
We also monitor SER risk for our Dell factories and 
suppliers annually. Continuous improvement is important 
for our operations, as well as those of our suppliers. 
Supplier audits 
We expect our suppliers to adhere to the RBA Code of 
Conduct. Audits help monitor suppliers’ compliance with 
the RBA Code of Conduct and highlight any areas of 
concern, which in turn helps Dell work with suppliers to 
improve their performance. In FY24, 365 factories in our 
supply chain across 17 geographic locations were audited.   
Our suppliers are audited by RBA-certified third-party 
auditors whose audits cover over 40 topics across five 
areas: labor (including risks of forced labor, child labor and 
noncompliance with weekly working hour requirements), 
employee health and safety, environment, ethics and 
management systems. Auditors review documents, 
observe work practices and independently interview 
management and workers19 to assess SER standards 
implementation according to the RBA Code of Conduct. 
In FY24, auditors conducted confidential feedback 
interviews with 14,077 workers as part of the audit 
process. After completion, auditors issued final reports 
identifying areas of noncompliance with the RBA Code 
of Conduct. The severity and number of these audit 
findings, classified as priority, major, minor and risk of 
noncompliance, impact a supplier’s overall audit score, 
which ranges from zero to 200. 
Audit findings may result in corrective action and the 
implementation of capability-building elements of the 
continuous improvement model. In FY24, we saw clear 
improvement in supplier factory audit performance, with 
63% of factories that went through at least their second 
audit cycle improving their audit scores between cycles. 
This includes final assembly suppliers (69%), direct 
suppliers (61%) and sub-tier suppliers (64%). Learn more 
about our supply chain audit results in the By the Numbers 
section of this report. 
One area in which we made progress is our suppliers’ 
target audit score attainment rate. Dell sets target audit 
scores for suppliers — at least 180 out of 200 for final 
assembly factories and 160 out of 200 for other factory 
tiers. These target audit scores align to high performance 
based on the RBA Validated Assessment Program. 
We made significant progress in increasing the rate of 
suppliers who attained our target audit scores. In FY24, 
our SER specialists worked closely with suppliers to help 
identify the root causes of issues and drive improvement. 
Additionally, we engaged across our procurement 
organization and directly with suppliers’ senior-level 
leadership to emphasize our expectations. As a result, 77% 
of our factories are high performing, meaning they scored 
at least 180 out of 200 available points for final assembly 
factories, or 160 out of 200 available points for other 
factory tiers and had no priority findings.

Corrective action plans 
Priority and major findings require prompt resolution. Once 
the supplier addresses an audit finding, it must be closed 
by a second successful audit or Dell SER specialists, who 
validate that the issue has been resolved. 
In FY24, 281 factories completed corrective actions, with 
157 closure audits completed to verify corrective actions. 
96% of priority findings were closed at supplier factories 
in the reporting period. (There was one priority finding at 
a final assembly factory in FY24 that was closed in FY25. 
100% of priority findings at direct supplier factories were 
closed, and 96% of priority findings at sub-tier factories 
were closed). 67% of priority and major findings were 
closed overall at supplier factories (38% at final assembly 
factories, 67% at direct supplier factories and 68% at sub-
tier factories). 
Dell does not tolerate forced labor or child labor in any 
form. We undertake due diligence to assess and address 
risks of modern slavery in our supply chain, including: 
• Proactively addressing issues with new and potential 
suppliers, prior to formal audits. 
• Coordinating with procurement, including SER 
representatives and executives, to ensure immediate 
closure of critical labor findings. 
• Requiring suppliers to build internal audit and 
governance mechanisms to prevent future instances if 
critical labor audit findings occur. 
• Ensuring both suppliers in scope and employees in 
supplier-facing roles within our procurement and 
operations organizations complete Dell’s required 
annual human rights training. 
Capability building 
To proactively address risks, we provide resources to 
suppliers for knowledge and skills building in areas such 
as forced labor and health and safety. 
Factory consultations: Our SER specialists work 
directly with supplier factories to better monitor and 
reduce risk. Engagements are customized to support long-
term improvements. 
Dell-led training and webinars: We use our digital tools to 
deliver trainings, roundtable sessions, interactive webinars 
and virtual networking sessions. These targeted events 
connect suppliers with sustainability leaders, examine 
emerging trends and risks and share best practices. 
Self-paced online training: Our online training programs 
are offered in various languages. These training programs 
encourage proactive knowledge and performance growth 
and drive corrective action. Mobile access makes our 
platform even more accessible, allowing convenient 
interaction with our SER specialists. In FY24, 718 factories 
had access to more than 427 training sessions, including 
mobile frontline worker training. 
To support our suppliers as they prepare for RBA audits, 
we developed an online question-and-answer system 
to provide quick and accurate answers to common 
SER management questions. The system was created 
in collaboration with internal and external experts, 
making it accessible to companies of any size or level of 
sustainability management experience. 
In total, 1,680 unique participants representing 400 unique 
factories attended our capability-building programs, 
completing approximately 107,922 hours of training on 
SER topics. 
Learn more about Dell’s approach to future-ready 
skills development. 
Education and collaboration 
Our efforts to strengthen the sustainability of our supply 
chain go beyond working directly with our suppliers. We 
leverage our experience and reputation to collaborate with 
peers and NGOs to educate suppliers and policymakers 
in hopes of bringing about more significant change and 
bettering the lives of those within our supply chain.  
Dell’s participation in programs like the Mekong 
Sustainable Manufacturing Alliance (The Alliance) 
in Southeast Asia illustrates our commitment to 
collaborative education. The Alliance, funded by the 
United States Agency for International Development 
(USAID) and implemented by the Institute for Sustainable 
Communities (ISC) in partnership with ELEVATE and the 
Asian Institute for Technology (AIT), aims to improve 
local, domestic and foreign migrant workers’ livelihoods, 
health and well-being and respect for workers’ rights; 
foster sustainable economic growth; and achieve greater 
development commitment and investment of suppliers 
towards the advancement of their workforces in the 
Mekong region. This initiative positively impacts workers, 
local communities and the environment while improving 
the capacity of factories and increasing their market 
competitiveness. We are now utilizing key learnings from 
this partnership to benefit suppliers in additional locations.

Responsible labor 
practices 
Ethical recruitment 
Dell is a member of the Responsible Labor Initiative and 
actively collaborates with stakeholders to address forced 
labor. We abide by the RBA Code of Conduct, which 
prohibits our suppliers from charging recruitment fees to 
their workers, even in locations where these practices are 
legal. By requiring suppliers to address fee payment issues 
when they occur and reinforcing responsible employment 
and recruitment practices through our SER specialists, we 
continue to drive improvement in this area. 
Due diligence efforts include conducting confidential 
interviews with supplier management and, separately, 
with workers as part of regular audits. We also take 
immediate action to investigate any allegations related 
to recruitment fees received through our helpline, media 
sources or NGO reports. 
If we learn that a supplier is not following recruitment fee 
practices as required by the RBA Code of Conduct, we: 
• Educate the supplier on why such fees are 
unacceptable. 
• Coach the supplier on effective ways to return fees. 
For instance, if fees are returned to affected workers 
through paychecks, unaffected individuals must 
understand why their pay does not change. 
• Track the supplier’s remediation progress. 
Read more on our ethical practices in the Ethics section of 
this report. 
Weekly working hours 
Dell adheres to industry standards required by the RBA 
Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct limits factory 
line workers to a maximum of 60 working hours per week 
or the limit stipulated by local law (whichever is stricter) 
and requires that employees and contractors have a 
minimum of one rest day per week. 
Breaches of working hour limits are the most common 
audit findings among supplier factories in our industry.20 
Although overtime is voluntary, excessive working hours 
impact work-life balance and, in some cases, increase 
health and safety risks. This is an important area of focus 
for us, and we are committed to working with our suppliers 
to improve overall compliance with the industry standard.   
Our strategy with suppliers includes the following actions:   
• Weekly monitoring of factories with known risks of 
nonconformance based on past audit performance. 
This provides an early indicator of potential deviation 
from the standard. 
• Collaboration with original design manufacturers 
to address identified risks of nonconformance. For 
example, creating a window where customer lead 
time can be adjusted or identifying when orders can 
be moved. 
• Capability building to provide suppliers with knowledge 
and tools to improve working hours performance 
through management systems. 
Working hour limits 
Consistently meeting this standard is an ongoing 
challenge across manufacturing and is affected by 
several factors, including but not limited to fluctuations 
in customer demand, workers’ desire to work voluntary 
overtime, transportation challenges and continuing global 
supply chain issues. 
Dell SER specialists work with our suppliers to identify 
and resolve challenges to meeting working hour limits. 
For example, a supplier faced an RBA audit violation for 
excessive working hours. Our SER specialists worked 
with the supplier to address this violation by improving 
management practices, establishing a sustainable 
production rhythm and exploring automation and 
employee retention strategies. As a result, this 
supplier successfully reduced working hours and met 
compliance standards. 
In FY24, our tracking of suppliers meeting the standard 
for weekly working hours covered 187,046 workers at 128 
supplier factories. The vast majority of these workers — 
88.2% — worked 60 hours per week or less. Additionally, 
83.1% of these workers took at least one rest day per 
week, every week in FY24, up from 81.7% in FY23. 
FY24 recruitment fees returned 
$3,370,568 
in fees were returned to workers 
Dell does not tolerate forced labor of 
any kind. Dell prohibits our suppliers 
from charging recruitment fees to their 
workers, employs robust due diligence 
efforts and actively collaborates with 
stakeholders to address the risk of 
forced labor.

Health, safety and 
worker rights 
Open communication 
The people in our supply chain are uniquely 
positioned to provide insight into day-to-day factory 
operations. This feedback is a critical input to help us 
validate supplier compliance with the RBA Code of 
Conduct and build greater context around issues and how 
they are addressed. 
Dell maintains a free phone helpline, available in multiple 
languages, to ensure the people in our supply chain, 
individuals and organizations representing them, have a 
reliable, confidential communications channel to share 
concerns or suggestions. 
A third-party, nongovernmental organization with expertise 
in worker feedback channels manages the helpline on 
our behalf. Available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
the helpline can be accessed by supplier employees 
and contractors outside the workplace, reinforcing the 
confidentiality of their feedback. Additionally, our mobile-
based app for reporting is open to everyone. Read more 
about this program in the Ethics section of this report. 
Workers who participate in audit interviews are 
provided with information cards that include the helpline 
number and details as an alternative way to provide 
anonymous feedback. 
Dell immediately and thoroughly investigates any 
allegations received through the helpline. These 
investigations may include unannounced visits to factories 
by SER specialists and/or third-party auditors. Depending 
on the nature of any findings, SER specialists will work 
with suppliers to develop corrective action plans to 
address areas of nonconformance. In cases of priority 
findings, suppliers are required to complete a third-party 
closure audit to confirm resolution of the finding. 
Mobile health and safety 
learning 
Digital learning through mobile phones enables worker 
access to vital trainings on key topics, including health and 
safety protocols and awareness of labor rights. 
Mobile phone learning is a collaborative initiative between 
Dell and our suppliers. We cover the training development 
costs. Our suppliers make them available to their workers 
and cover the cost of Wi-Fi to ensure internet access. All 
frontline workers, including direct, temporary, students and 
migrants, are eligible and encouraged to participate. 
Ongoing training topics include: 
• Labor rights topics, including policies banning 
recruitment fees, contract requirements, pay 
structures, rules around voluntary overtime, 
requirements for factories to pay social insurance 
benefits, right to paid leave and holidays, grievance 
mechanisms and right to resign. 
• Health and safety topics, including safety 
training, guidelines on the use of process chemicals, 
how to use personal protective equipment, the 
importance of daily machine safety checks and fire 
and emergency procedures. 
• Personal development topics, including financial 
literacy, career development and communication 
skills. These topics are optional for workers. 
Mobile phone learning opportunities increase knowledge 
and skills and improve safety. In addition, workers 
are empowered by understanding their rights and the 
availability of grievance mechanisms to help identify areas 
of nonconformance with standards in their factories.

Safe use of chemicals 
Our work with suppliers to improve health and safety 
in the workplace includes taking action on the use 
of process chemicals. We are reducing exposure to 
potentially harmful process chemicals through our 
Chemical Use Policy. We have also developed Guidelines 
for Management of Manufacturing Process Chemicals 
to help suppliers implement best practices for managing 
chemicals that pose environmental or health risks. In 
addition, we surveyed 72 suppliers to understand and 
monitor chemical use in our supply chain. 
Dell also collaborates with the Clean Electronics 
Production Network (CEPN) to advance IT industry efforts 
to protect supply chain workers from potentially harmful 
process chemicals. CEPN is comprised of over 20 member 
organizations including electronics brands and suppliers, 
environmental NGOs, labor and worker representatives, 
ecolabels and representatives from academia and 
government agencies. Our ongoing involvement with CEPN 
includes active participation in the Worker Engagement 
and Process Chemical Reporting workgroups, and Dell is a 
founding signatory and one of four companies to commit 
to the Toward Zero Exposure program. 
The Toward Zero Exposure program: 
• Creates a road map for process chemical management 
informed by suppliers, nongovernmental organizations 
and subject matter experts. 
• Supports companies in assessing the use of process 
chemicals, strengthening the culture of worker safety 
and engagement, reducing worker exposure to 
identified priority chemicals and substituting them with 
safer alternatives. 
• Measures and reports outcomes, expands the impact 
and reaches into deeper supply chain tiers. 
Safe working conditions 
In FY24, we continued the TenSquared program with eight 
of our suppliers. The TenSquared approach is one that 
engages a peer-elected team of supplier employees and 
managers who work together to identify root causes of 
workplace challenges and then identify innovative ways to 
resolve them, all within 100 days. 
Each participating supplier brought its most challenging 
environmental, health and safety (EHS) management 
concerns to the TenSquared program. The topics from 
participating suppliers covered EHS hotspots, such as 
reducing fire risks in warehouse areas and reducing 
occurrences of accidents resulting in work injuries. 
Each supplier formed a dedicated work team, including 
members from management and frontline workers, to 
proactively resolve these issues and achieve a preset goal 
within 100 days. 
These proactive actions included: 
• Conducting a worker survey to understand worker 
concerns, incidents and historical data collection, 
among others. 
• Team brainstorming to identify risks, risk classification 
and assessment. 
• Communicating with diverse stakeholders to 
encourage engagement and collect effective 
improvement suggestions. 
• Ensuring support for improvements, including financial 
and technical support and production flexibility. 
• Keeping on track with weekly team meetings to monitor 
improvement action and implementation progress. 
• Attending program training events to build capability 
and conducting impact surveys among production 
workers to evaluate improvement, impact and 
achievements. These surveys also allowed 
opportunities to provide feedback on 
further improvements. 
• Regularly engaging worker representatives and 
factory management representatives to review 
process chemicals.

Responsible 
minerals sourcing 
These commitments are underscored in the Dell 
Responsible Sourcing Policy. We also coordinate with 
industry-wide groups such as the Responsible Minerals 
Initiative (RMI). A Dell sustainability leader sits on the 
RMI steering committee to further our commitments 
and actively drive progress. RMI, and organizations like 
it, promotes a common approach, tools and processes 
supporting sourcing decisions that drive improved and 
consistent overall regulatory compliance. 
Our responsible sourcing efforts focus on key “conflict 
minerals” (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold — known as 
3TG) and follow the recommendations established by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) Due Diligence Guidance. These include conducting 
risk assessments, assurance and transparent reporting. 
We also track other minerals of concern, including 
cobalt, used in lithium-ion batteries, and mica, used as an 
electrical insulator. 
Our approach places an emphasis on identifying and 
assuring smelters or refiners (SORs) used to process 
material supplied by mines or mineral processors. This 
includes an independent, third-party assessment of 
management systems and sourcing practices to 
validate conformance with the Responsible Minerals 
Assurance Process (RMAP). The sector-wide RMAP 
standards meet the OECD Due Diligence Guidance 
requirements, the Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the 
European Parliament and the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Dell annually files 
a Conflict Minerals Disclosure with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
Minerals are an important component 
of many Dell Technologies products. 
Some of these minerals are potentially 
mined in conflict-affected and high-
risk areas. While we do not purchase 
minerals directly from mines, smelters or 
refiners, our expectations for responsible 
sourcing extend throughout our supply 
chain. It is our goal to purchase materials 
containing minerals whose mining and 
sale are aligned with our responsible 
sourcing commitments. 
Tracking conformance rates 
To track conformance rates, we require suppliers who 
use 3TG within their supply chain to complete the Conflict 
Minerals Reporting Template. To extend our due diligence 
process, we have engaged with the RMI to use the 
Extended Minerals Reporting Template for suppliers using 
cobalt or mica. 
Because the sourcing of minerals is an ever-changing 
landscape, we are committed to watching this space 
closely to protect the lives and health of the people in our 
supply chain. 
Given the many supply chain tiers involved and the size 
of smelting and refining operations, multiple suppliers will 
likely include some of the same SORs in their reporting. 
Through the RMI, Dell encourages suppliers to promote 
SOR participation in third-party assurance programs to 
achieve conformance or remove them from their supply 
chains. More information is available in our Conflict 
Minerals Disclosure.

Supplier diversity 
One essential measurement of our success is how much 
we spend with small and diverse businesses. In CY23, 
Dell spent more than $3 billion21 with small and diverse 
businesses, showing our continued commitment to 
working with these suppliers. For the 14th consecutive 
year, Dell also earned recognition through the Billion 
Dollar Roundtable (BDR), which celebrates corporations 
that spend at least $1 billion annually with minority- and 
women-owned businesses. 
While spend is an important indicator of our engagement 
with small and diverse suppliers, it is only one of the 
ways we work to drive meaningful impact and inclusion. 
We continually identify strategic opportunities within our 
supply chain to promote businesses of all backgrounds. 
Diversity within our suppliers’ 
organizations 
We prioritize sourcing from suppliers who demonstrate 
a solid commitment to supplier diversity within 
their own organizations. To drive accountability in our 
supply chain, we monitor how much our key suppliers 
spend with small and diverse suppliers. In CY23, our 
suppliers reported spending more than $1 billion* with 
small and diverse companies. 
Dell seeks opportunities to drive diversity 
within our supply chain as part of our 
commitment to responsible business 
practices. We have well-established 
initiatives to identify and support qualified 
businesses owned by individuals of 
diverse backgrounds to deliver products 
and services that meet the needs of our 
global customer base. 
Skills development support 
We partner with suppliers who are qualified in accordance 
with the U.S. Small Business Administration guidelines or 
certified by the following third party organizations: 
• Women’s Business Enterprise National Council 
• WEConnect International 
• National Minority Supplier Development Council 
• National LGBT Chamber of Commerce 
• Disability:IN 
• National Veteran Business Development Council 
• Minority Supplier Development China 
• Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
in India 
• Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council 
• South African Supplier Diversity Council 
Both Dell and our suppliers continually look for 
opportunities to promote and give equal access to small 
and diverse businesses that are majority-owned and 
operated by women, minorities, members of the LGBQT+ 
community, veterans, service-disabled veterans, members 
of the disabled community, disadvantaged persons 
and those located in a historically underutilized business

One element of our supplier diversity initiatives is the 
support of skills development for small and diverse 
suppliers. To provide these suppliers with the most 
effective tools, we partner with third parties who 
specialize in relevant skills development. We also 
support our suppliers through one-on-one mentoring to 
build their capabilities.

Trust
The pervasive influence of digital 
technologies on society at large raises 
the stakes for how all technology 
companies address security, privacy and 
ethics. Customers should expect their 
technology provider to protect their best 
interests, and team members should 
expect the same from their employer. 
Upholding trust 
through security, 
privacy and ethics 
Our approach to trust 
As an industry leader, it is important people trust what we build, trust who we are and trust how we do our work. That is 
why we are committed to driving trust in our products and services, our internal processes and in our ecosystem across 
security, privacy and ethics.

2030 GOAL 
By 2030, our customers and partners will rate Dell Technologies as their most 
trusted technology partner 
We announced this goal in FY23 and worked in FY24 to identify best practices for measuring trust among customers and 
partners. We aim to make progress against our key drivers for Trust and will continue to evolve how to best measure and 
communicate progress against this goal. 
KEY DRIVERS 
By 2024, Dell will make available the first validated Zero 
Trust solution, accredited by the U.S. government and 
commercially available to targeted global public and 
private sector organizations 
Dell’s Zero Trust solution, Project Fort Zero, is awaiting a 
testing date for validation from the U.S. Government. We 
anticipate publishing a general availability date shortly 
following the successful completion of the U.S. Government 
validation test. 
By 2025, 100% of actively sold Dell-designed and branded 
products and offerings will publish a software bill of 
materials (SBOM), providing transparency on third-party 
and open-source components 
We are working to determine the full scope of actively sold 
Dell-designed and branded products and offerings and 
to establish our metric pipeline. At the close of FY24, we 
had generated SBOMs for 70 Dell-designed and branded 
products and are on track to meet this key driver by 2025. 
By 2030, all new Dell products and offerings that use 
authentication will offer a password-less authentication 
mechanism 
We are working to ensure our product architectures 
enable password-less authentication, including certificate-
based management, and incorporation of hardware-
bound authentication methods are being established and 
adopted into roadmaps. Current solutions, such as Secure 
Component Verification and support for Windows Hello, 
provide early capabilities for end-users. 
Each year through 2030, we will make it easier and faster 
for customers to exercise choice and control over their 
personal data 
In FY24, Dell made customer choice and control over 
personal data easier and faster through the expansion of 
our enhanced Privacy Center, which is now available in 74 
locations globally.

INTRODUCTION 

To earn our customers’ trust and protect 
Dell Technologies, we embed security 
and resiliency in everything we do. We 
believe customers should be able to trust 
what we build. Dell aims to build security 
into our products and works to secure 
and maintain the resiliency of our assets 
and the assets entrusted to our care by 
customers and other stakeholders. This 
commitment to security and resiliency 
is core to meeting our 2030 goal of 
becoming the most trusted technology 
partner for customers and partners. 
Security 
Zero Trust solution 
We are engineering world-class security features into the 
products and services we deliver. We emphasize built-
in security controls and features that provide intrinsic 
security throughout. 
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user, 
device or application is automatically trusted, even if it is 
inside the organization’s network. All users, devices and 
applications are considered potential threats until proven 
otherwise. This approach is critical given the 
rise of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, mobile 
devices and hybrid work – on top of increasingly 
sophisticated cyberattacks. 
Dell’s Zero Trust solution, Project Fort Zero, is currently 
awaiting a testing date for validation from the U.S. 
Government. We anticipate publishing a general 
availability date shortly following the successful 
completion of the U.S. Government validation test. 
SBOM for 100% of products 
We are committed to engaging with industry partners 
to define best practices for generating SBOMs and 
participating in industry-wide initiatives that support the 
delivery of consistent and easily consumable SBOMs 
to our customers. In FY24, this included our active 
participation in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency CISA-led working group. This working 
group collaborated to draft guidance on the issuance of 
Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) information 
and types of SBOM documents. Additionally, as a 
member of the Forum of Incident Response and Security 
Teams (FIRST), Dell collaborated to publish a standard 
Consolidated SBOM VEX Operational Framework. 
By providing an SBOM that includes the exact inventory 
of third-party software used in a product, we are building 
trust with our customers, providing them the ability to 
better track security issues that may impact their product. 
Our focus is to create an SBOM that includes all open-
source software and commercial components from tier 
one suppliers. This SBOM will be introduced in a product at 
the time of its release. 
We introduced this SBOM key driver in our FY23 Report, 
and in FY24 we worked to further define its scope. We 
have further refined our scope of products for the SBOM 
goal to include new releases for the latest generation of 
Dell-designed and branded IT infrastructure products. 
This includes servers, storage and networking solutions, as 
well as commercial laptop and desktop products available 
on Dell.com. 
We are on track to meet this target. At the close of FY24, 
over 70 Dell-designed and branded products have SBOMs. 
KEY DRIVER 
FY24: At the close of FY24, we had generated SBOMs 
for 70 Dell-designed and branded products and are on 
track to meet this key driver by 2025. 
By 2025, 100% of actively sold 
Dell-designed and branded

Password-less authentication 
Password technology was designed and built over 60 
years ago, long before today’s cyber threats emerged and 
began exploiting it. We are working to ensure our offerings 
have a password-less authentication mechanism, 
including certificate-based management and incorporation 
of hardware-bound authentication methods, are being 
established and adopted into roadmaps. Current solutions, 
such as Secure Component Verification and support for 
Windows Hello provide early capabilities for end users. 
Product security 
Dell strives to provide customers with timely information, 
guidance and mitigation options to help minimize 
risks associated with security vulnerabilities. The Dell 
Product Security Incident Response Team (Dell PSIRT) 
is responsible for coordinating the response to, and 
disclosure of, product vulnerabilities impacting Dell 
products. Product and Application Security at Dell helps 
ensure products offered to customers are protected 
against cyber threats and security vulnerabilities. 
This includes responsibilities to build security into the 
development lifecycle and to respond promptly to 
reported vulnerabilities. 
Our processes and procedures align with the FIRST 
PSIRT Services Framework, as well as other standards 
including ISO/IEC 29147:2018 and ISO/IEC 30111:2019. 
Read Dell’s Vulnerability Response Policy. 
In FY24, the PSIRT issued 370 product security advisories 
to help customers keep Dell product deployments secure. 
Early in FY24, we conducted a public bug bounty 
program covering most Dell-developed products 
and applications under active support. This program 
complemented our existing measures to find and 
address security vulnerabilities throughout the software 
development lifecycle. 
Taking a proactive approach to vulnerability mitigation, 
this program incentivized a diverse set of third-party 
researchers to test the security of our products and 
applications in accordance with Dell-provided guidelines. 
Cybersecurity 
We are committed to managing cybersecurity risk, 
maintaining compliance and appropriately securing our 
environment to ensure we are protecting customer and 
company data. We set standards for, implement and 
maintain security programs and technology to help Dell 
manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk. 
We work diligently to guard sensitive information against 
exposure and exploitation and to protect the operational 
resiliency of our digital systems and networks. For 
example, we secure our internal network environment 
and associated assets through controls such as anti-
malware protection, strong modern authentication 
methods, advanced email security, system and application 
vulnerability management, intrusion prevention and 
modern firewalls. 
Dell also employs the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) principles of “separation of duties” 
and “least privilege” to guide key controls throughout the 
supply chain, which help prevent misuse of data access 
across the business. These principles help us work to 
appropriately manage access to sensitive information in 
line with the degree needed to perform assigned duties. 
KEY DRIVER 
FY24: We are working to ensure our product 
architectures enable passwordless 
authentication, including certificate-based 
management, and incorporation of hardware-bound 
authentication methods are being established and 
adopted into roadmaps. 
By 2030, all new Dell products and 
offerings that use authentication 
will offer a password-less 
authentication mechanism

Industry partnerships 
Dell participates in multiple industry-wide organizations 
to collaborate with other leading vendors to define, evolve, 
advance and share security best practices. Learn more 
about our security industry partnerships. 
Secure supply chain 
Dell takes a holistic approach to protecting its supply chain 
and delivering solutions that customers can trust. The 
strategy of “defense-in-depth” and “defense-in-breadth” 
involves multiple layers of controls to help mitigate threats 
that could be introduced into the supply chain. These 
controls, along with effective risk management, help 
secure our supply chain. 
There are several capabilities that are valued at Dell 
when determining what controls should be implemented 
throughout each phase of the supply chain, including 
security, integrity, quality and resiliency. 
Read more about security in Dell’s supply chain.

Privacy 
Enhanced privacy centers 
Dell ensures customers have access to information about 
how and why we collect personal data in our publicly 
available regional privacy statements, and we regularly 
review these statements to ensure compliance as laws 
evolve. Anyone, including customers, team members and 
people outside of Dell, may report privacy concerns via 
privacy@dell.com. 
Over the last year, Dell worked to make customer choice 
and control over personal data easier and faster through 
the expansion of our enhanced Privacy Center, which 
is now available in 74 locations globally. The enhanced 
design includes more functionality and a simpler user 
interface, providing more speed, choice and control for 
the management of personal data. The enhanced Privacy 
Center provides education and awareness of Dell privacy 
practices and facilitates instant automated intake of Data 
Subject Rights requests and consumer privacy questions 
or complaints. 
We aim to embed privacy into every 
Dell operation, product and service 
in order to earn customer trust. We 
respect individuals’ preferences 
about their personal data and focus 
on transparency and accountability 
in our data practice. Through robust 
governance frameworks, we regularly 
assess how we are making progress 
toward our privacy goals, and we take 
steps to ensure our business partners 
share our commitment to privacy. 
KEY DRIVER 
FY24: To meet this goal, we are taking thoughtful 
action on our commitment to tell our customers why 
and how we collect data. We also provide them the 
ability to exercise choice and control concerning how 
we process personal data through our Privacy Centers. 
Dell has rolled out these enhanced Dell Privacy Center 
experience to 74 locations globally. 
Each year through 2030, we will 
make it easier and faster for 
customers to exercise choice and 
control over their personal data. 
Privacy policy and governance 
Our internal Global Data Privacy Policy governs how we 
collect, store and use personal data for legitimate business 
purposes. This policy establishes and communicates 
principles for the effective and efficient management of 
personal information necessary to meet our commitments 
to our customers, as well as our legal, regulatory and 
contractual requirements. Our internal Global Data Privacy 
Policy is supplemental to (not in place of) all applicable 
country or regional privacy policies and processes. 
In FY24, we evolved the governance under our Global Data 
Privacy Policy. Our governance includes: 
• Privacy by Design Standard: This standard which 
defines minimum privacy requirements for the 
design, implementation and maintenance of any Dell 
information system, product, offer or service that 
involves the processing of personal data. Alongside this 
launch, we launched tools and processes for our team 
members to help them execute and uphold our Privacy 
by Design Standard. 
• Privacy Program Charter: This charter defines the 
mission, strategy, structure and core principles for our 
Global Privacy Program. This charter outlines roles and 
responsibilities to ensure accountability, as well as a 
clear and consistent approach to privacy across Dell. 
Dell’s Chief Privacy Officer leads a team of dedicated 
privacy professionals committed to supporting the 
Global Privacy Program. Dell uses the NIST Privacy 
Framework and maintains governance practices, including 
the application of processes and controls for 
the protection of personal data, to help ensure and 
measure the effectiveness of the privacy program and 
report out as appropriate to company leadership and the 
Board of Directors.

Ethics 
Ethics is foundational to all we do at 
Dell Technologies. By adhering to the 
highest ethical standards, we build trust 
with our customers, team members 
and stakeholders. We create a positive 
reputation that will contribute to our 
success for decades to come, proudly 
leading in this space and continuously 
striving to enhance our programs. 
We believe our culture and values are 
differentiators. For the 12th year, Dell has 
been recognized by Ethisphere as one of 
the World’s Most Ethical Companies® . 
Codes of conduct 
Our Code of Conduct helps team members translate Dell’s 
values into actions and provides guidance on how we carry 
out our daily activities across the company in accordance 
with our culture and in compliance with the letter and spirit 
of all applicable laws in the countries in which we work. 
Our culture and values reflect what is most important to us 
as a company and guide our decisions and actions: 
• Customers: We believe our customer relationships 
are the ultimate differentiator and the foundation for 
our success. 
• Winning Together: We believe in and value our people. 
We perform better, are smarter and have more fun 
working as a team than as individuals. 
• Innovation: We believe our ability to innovate and 
cultivate breakthrough thinking is an engine for growth, 
success and progress. 
• Results: We believe in being accountable to an 
exceptional standard of excellence and performance. 
• Integrity: We believe integrity must always govern our 
desire to win. 
Our resellers, suppliers, vendors and other third parties are 
an extension of our business and, therefore, our reputation 
and impact. We hold them to the same high ethical 
standard we set for ourselves and require partners to 
agree to expectations before formalizing our partnership. 
Our expectations for third parties are clearly set in our 
Code of Conduct for Partners and Supplier Principles. 
For our go-to-market partners, we take an extra step to 
ensure Dell products and services are purchased with 
integrity and transparency. We also work with industry 
experts to provide our partners with digital tools to assess 
and improve their own anti-corruption programs. We 
leverage business intelligence to continuously audit and 
monitor our direct partners to ensure adherence to our 
expectations. Partners who are found to violate our ethics 
standards are disciplined and held accountable. 
Speak Up 
One of the ways that Dell maintains an ethical culture is by 
expeditiously and thoroughly investigating allegations of 
misconduct made against team members or partners. 
Speak Up is our reporting system that augments our 
other efforts to foster a culture of trust, integrity and 
ethical decision making. Speak Up allows our Global 
Ethics and Compliance Office line of sight into attempted 
circumvention of policies and/or controls or other 
activities that may negatively impact customers and other 
stakeholders. Anyone can confidentially and anonymously 
use Speak Up to report 
suspected violations of the Dell 
Technologies Code of Conduct, 
policies or applicable laws. Dell 
does not tolerate retaliation and 
is committed to protecting team 
members who report suspected 
misconduct in good faith. 
Ethics governance 
During FY24, we named a new Chief Ethics and 
Compliance Officer (CECO) to oversee Dell’s Global Ethics 
and Compliance Office. The CECO plays a broader risk 
and governance role as co-chair of the Global Risk and 
Compliance Council (GRCC) and Enterprise Risk Steering 
Committee (ERSC). To ensure independence in decision 
making and authority, the CECO reports dotted line to 
the chair of the Audit Committee and provides quarterly 
readouts to the full committee.

Anti-corruption program and 
policy 
We are committed to winning business only on the 
merits and integrity of our products, services and people. 
Corruption damages our company and the communities 
where we do business. Dell takes a zero-tolerance stance 
on bribery both within Dell and for our go-to-market 
partners who represent the Dell name. This zero-tolerance 
policy is outlined in our internal Global Anti-Corruption 
Policy. Our team members and go-to-market partners 
receive frequent communications and trainings on our 
anti-corruption policy. 
Trade compliance program and 
policy 
Consistent with adhering to the highest ethical standards, 
we continue to invest in our Trade Compliance Program, 
driving compliance with global sanctions, export controls 
and import requirements. We are committed to doing 
business with customers, vendors and other partners who 
share our commitment to equality, trust and driving human 
progress. 
We leverage tools such as customer and vendor screening 
and other procedures to ensure that we do not sell to or 
purchase from unauthorized entities. As global restrictions 
continue to increase in complexity, we continue to 
proactively strengthen our program through enhanced 
cross-functional collaboration, improved tools and 
awareness initiatives across the business. 
Principles for ethical artificial 
intelligence 
We believe artificial intelligence (AI) must be developed 
and applied ethically and responsibly. In FY23, we 
established the Dell Technologies Principles for Ethical 
Artificial Intelligence, a set of guiding principles to 
follow as we develop and use AI applications. We also 
established the AI Review Board, which reviews all internal 
use cases for AI and ensures adherence to laws and to our 
principles for AI. 
In FY24, we named our first-ever Chief AI officer and 
created the AI Center of Innovation and Excellence whose 
responsibility is to enable Dell to reach its full AI potential 
through people, process and tools. This includes helping 
set governance, policies and managing risks in addition 
to working with our learning and development teams to 
establish a pan-Dell AI curriculum that ensures our team 
members have the required AI skillsets. 
We are leveraging AI and applying these principles 
internally to improve our own processes. In FY24, we 
expanded upon our Corruption and Risk Detection System 
(CARDS) and filed a U.S. patent application. CARDS is a 
machine learning-enabled software application designed 
to proactively detect potential risks in the quoting pre-sales 
workstream.

multi-national companies in the technology industry. 
This session set the ethical tone at the top by directly 
communicating enhanced expectations for these senior 
leaders. The CEO participated in this session, establishing 
strict expectations for winning with integrity. 
On-site sessions 
Our multi-faceted awareness approach includes 
focused on-site engagement. In FY24, Global Ethics and 
Compliance partnered with business leaders in India to 
host “India Ethics Week.” 
Activities included the pilot of a newly developed 
executive-led session to ensure a strong and consistent 
tone within all levels of management, a hybrid fireside 
chat focused on the importance of an ethical culture 
and interactive digital gamification aimed at compliance 
awareness. This event is the first of its kind, and we are 
considering how to scale these successful events to be 
used again in other locations. 
Training and awareness 
We have adapted our training philosophy to adopt a 
risk-based, role-based approach. We are focused on the 
topics that matter most to our brand and reputation, and 
we adapt content and training requirements depending 
on a team member’s role. Team members who do not 
complete the mandatory training are held accountable for 
their inaction, with consequences including loss of annual 
bonus or other disciplinary action, where permitted by law. 
Foundational training 
Each year, our entire Dell Technologies team, inclusive of 
new hires, completes a series of mandatory courses to 
ensure we have the foundational knowledge and tools to 
make the right decisions that support our ethical culture. 
In FY24, 100% of eligible team members completed 
training including trade compliance, use of social media, AI 
governance and upholding human rights. 
Our Code of Conduct training includes interactive and 
engaging scenarios to maximize learning experience and 
retention. We refresh this content annually to address new 
applicable laws and corresponding policies. 
Supplemental role-based training 
Required training for all employees includes foundational 
knowledge on privacy. 
In FY24, we expanded our privacy training to include a new, 
expanded privacy module, which is more interactive and 
more comprehensive, distributing it to all team members 
whose roles required a deeper understanding of privacy 
practices and principles. 
We revisit these trainings each year, ensuring that the 
content stays relevant for our team members. In FY24, in 
conjunction with the launch of new programs, we offered a 
HIPAA training and a Privacy by Design training for relevant 
team members. 
Security training 
All employees take a foundational security training 
every year. Additionally, our training programs promote 
secure software and systems by increasing security 
awareness and adoption of security practices within our 
development teams. 
To ensure adherence to our security standards, we require 
Secure Development Training for all new engineering team 
members. We also offer an annual refresher on these 
topics. In FY24, nearly 18,000 engineers completed our 
annual refresher. 
Leader training 
We believe people managers have a special responsibility 
to lead with integrity. Therefore, all people managers 
received foundational leader training in FY24, aimed at 
helping managers better understand their role related 
to ethical tone, speaking up and accountability. People 
managers received custom-tailored instructions on how 
to create a thriving environment for good decisions and 
actions and how to encourage team members to use their 
voice. We also launched a Leading with Integrity resource 
site with new toolkits for managers to facilitate honest and 
transparent ethics-related discussions within their teams. 
Our most senior Trust leaders hosted an interactive 
and engaging session aimed to inform Dell’s executives 
of current regulations and lessons learned from other 
Public advocacy 
In FY24, Dell announced our new ESG Trust pillar, 
which is a three-pronged strategy inclusive of 
privacy, security and ethics and compliance. In 
listening to customers, we realized how important 
these key aspects are in building trust. Privacy, 
security and ethics are especially important 
in building trust when it comes to the use and 
creation of new technologies, like AI. Dell is 
committed to developing and implementing AI 
ethically and responsibly to help businesses and 
people innovate. 
In FY24, we also: 
• Engaged with the World Economic Forum 
(WEF) regarding Digital Trust. 
• Partnered with GovExecTV and participated 
in an interview on security and AI in the 
public sector. 
• Developed a thought leadership blog on 
security and AI in the public sector for the 
National Academy for Public Administration. 
• Spoke at the Aspen Institute on the impact of 
AI on cybersecurity. 
• Participated in the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies (CSIS) AI 
Regulation Event. 
• Joined the AI Alliance, a group of organizations 
across industry, startup, academia, research 
and government coming together to support 
open innovation and open science in AI.

Corporate 
governance 
Board governance 
Dell Technologies believes that effectively assessing and 
managing risk is central to the design and execution of 
our business strategy and the creation of long-term value. 
Our Board of Directors, directly and through its standing 
committees, oversees the establishment and maintenance 
of our governance, compliance and risk oversight 
processes and procedures to promote the conduct of 
our business with the highest standards of responsibility, 
ethics and integrity. 
One of the board’s many strengths stems from the 
diversity of perspectives and understanding that arises 
from convening individuals of varied backgrounds and 
experiences. We currently have two members on our 
eight-member board who identify as women and one 
director who identifies as Black/African American, and 
we will continue to ensure a diverse pool of candidates is 
considered for each seat. Six of our board members are 
classified as independent, according to New York Stock 
Exchange guidelines. 
Annually, the lead independent director presides over

ESG governance 
Our governance framework incorporates ESG targets and 
goals into the company’s overall strategy and operations. 
We have established governance bodies, including 
the ESG Steering Committee and ESG Interlock Team, 
tasked with overseeing and executing our Sustainability 
and ESG strategies and progress. We have evolved the 
responsibilities of these governance bodies to meet 
emerging trends and our growing ESG efforts. 
To ensure an integrated perspective and approach to 
ESG, these management committees are composed 
of members from various teams across the company, 
including representatives from functions such as 
corporate sustainability and ESG, diversity and inclusion, 
human resources, philanthropy, security, ethics and 
privacy, supply chain audit, corporate affairs, government 
affairs, internal audit, legal, risk management, investor 
relations, accounting, finance, and product, operations and 
services teams. 
Together, these governance bodies develop, manage 
and measure ESG strategy and performance. Our ESG 
governance framework ensures a central point of control, 
communication and decision-making, strengthening our 
ability to add long-term value, minimize risk and drive 
societal progress by: 
• Providing clear lines of responsibility and 
accountability for ESG initiatives, which makes it easier 
to track progress and hold individuals and teams 
accountable for their performance. This includes the 
establishment of executive oversight for each of our 
ESG goals and initiatives. 
• Reducing duplication of efforts and creating a 
consistent approach across different departments 
and business units, leading to increased efficiency and 
cost-savings. 
• Strengthening our stakeholder engagement to ensure 
alignment with the expectations of our customers, 
employees, investors and regulators. 
• Improving our reporting and transparency by 
ensuring that ESG data is collected, analyzed and 
reported consistently and accurately, enhancing our 
transparency and credibility with stakeholders. 
Representatives from our ESG Steering Committee 
regularly provide the Board of Directors with updates on 
progress against our ESG goals and initiatives to support 
the integration of ESG measures with the company’s 
overall business strategy. In addition to these regular 
updates, we provide relevant training to the board 
as needed. For example, in FY24, the board received 
training on the company’s corporate human rights policy 
commitments, due diligence and governance practices in 
alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights.

Risk assessment 
Dell is committed to a strong risk 
management culture. Through risk 
oversight practices and a culture of 
risk management among Dell team 
members, we better understand our 
potential for risk and opportunity. 
Enterprise risk management 
Dell’s Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight, 
and Dell’s management is responsible for designing 
processes and procedures to identify, assess and 
manage risk on a day-to-day basis. Management has 
implemented an enterprise risk management (ERM) 
program, managed by Dell’s internal audit function and 
supported by management risk committees. The ERM 
program is designed to work across the business to 
identify, assess, govern and manage the Company’s 
strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks. Our 
ERM program seeks to enhance enterprise awareness 
of risk management, recommend best practices for risk 
management and highlight critical risk areas to optimize 
allocation of resources. 
Although Dell continually assesses its risk environment, 
the internal audit function performs an annual risk 
assessment that is informed by risk data collection, an 
analysis of industry trends, consideration of insights of 
third-party risk reporting companies, peer benchmarking 
and interviews with senior leaders and Company experts. 
The annual assessment considers whether risks 
constitute short, medium and long-term threats to our 
enterprise and provides for prioritization, in part, based 
on the timeframe of such risks. Our ERM program is 
assessed externally on a periodic basis for best practices 
and maturity of the program. The ERM program aims to 
identify the most critical risks and opportunities impacting 
Dell’s business objectives. 
We work to foster a strong risk management culture 
among Dell team members, because they are our 
first defense against risk. Across the business our 
management risk committees are an integral part of 
the overall ERM structure, promoting risk management 
and compliance best practices and oversight within the 
business. 
The output of the Company’s enterprise risk assessment 
serves as an important consideration in the Company’s 
risk based internal audit roadmap. Regular updates are 
provided to the Board and Audit Committee on various 
risk-related matters as identified by the ERM program, 
including any related to climate risks. 
Please read the Audit Committee Charter and refer to 
our SEC Form 10-K, Item 1A – Risk Factors for a 
description of important risks that may impact the 
company’s performance.

Climate risks 
We are committed to identifying, managing and mitigating 
climate risks by leveraging our ERM program alongside 
ESG and climate-specific governance models. We use the 
framework proposed by the Taskforce for Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosure (TCFD) to ensure that climate risks 
are governed to the same standard as other risks we 
face, while acknowledging the unique long-term nature of 
climate change. 
In FY24, we conducted a climate-specific risk assessment 
using scenario analysis. The analysis incorporated 
the latest climate scenarios developed by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 
sixth assessment and covered physical risks, transition 
risks and climate opportunities. 
Our assessment consisted of: 
• A review of climate risks which affect us today and a 
roadmap on how we can further integrate climate risks 
into our ERM processes. 
• A high-level scenario analysis of over 1,000 Dell and 
supplier sites subject to 11 physical hazards between 
2°C and 4°C scenarios, from the present day to 2050.22 
This assessment revealed how Dell-owned facilities and 
our supply chain are potentially exposed to a matrix of 
hazards and scenarios across time horizons. 
• A deep-dive scenario analysis on three key topics: 
covering a physical risk in our supply chain, a transition 
risk in carbon pricing and a transition opportunity 
around low-carbon products. Scenarios included 
those by the IPCC and IEA between 1.5C and 4C+, 
with time horizons from 2030 and 2050. This analysis 
helped us refine our mitigation planning for financial 
value that is at risk across our supply chain, for 
potential impacts that carbon pricing could have on our 
supply chain and for changes in the price of goods and 
services that we purchase. 
These assessments support our readiness for reporting 
requirements like the EU Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD) and TCFD aligned disclosure 
from various stakeholders, including the governments 
where we operate and our customers. 
In alignment with our climate goals, we will work to 
integrate these climate assessments results into our 
business planning processes. This way, we can build a 
climate-resilient strategy into our operations and supply 
chain. Moving forward, we plan to provide updates on 
these strategic integrations in Dell Technologies Climate 
Transition Action Plans starting in FY25. 
ESG risk 
We assess ESG-related risks to ensure we understand 
our potential risk areas. Our materiality assessment helps 
us understand ESG-specific topics most material to our 
business, and we will have a clearer understanding of 
ESG topics most material to Dell at the conclusion of our 
in-progress double materiality assessment. For topics 
such as human rights and climate risks, we conduct 
assessments with third-party experts to better understand 
our risks. 
Human rights risks 
We periodically engage third-party experts to conduct 
human rights impact assessments (HRIAs) to ensure and 
advance our understanding of human rights risks and 
impacts. These assessments inform Dell policies and 
support our risk mitigation, governance practices and 
strategic priorities. 
We are dedicated to continually increasing our 
understanding and effective mitigation of actual, potential 
or emerging risks. The ongoing effectiveness and evolution 
of our human rights strategy is built on identifying 
opportunities to accelerate positive impacts and address 
risks. Insights from our FY24 third-party HRIA deepened 
our understanding of current, new and evolving salient 
risks and continues to inform and strengthen our risk 
mitigation strategies and governance practices. View 
our most salient human rights risks in the Human Rights 
section of this report.

Public policy 
We work across the public and private 
sectors on a variety of environmental, 
social, economic and technological 
challenges and opportunities. We 
recognize that both governments and 
companies have roles to play in response 
to mounting global concerns. 
Our approach 
We work with all our stakeholders as we formulate our 
positions on policy-related issues. When we decide where 
and when to engage on matters of public interest, we 
regularly engage with team members, customers, partners, 
communities, investors, policymakers, governments, NGOs 
and trade associations. Dell Technologies supports the 
following government actions and policies: 
• Taking climate action by leveraging technology, 
supporting research and development and 
promoting resiliency. 
• Leveraging advanced technology to undertake smart 
city plans and develop smarter options for mobility, 
safety, water consumption, renewable power 
generation and storage, power and water distribution 
and health care. 
• Working toward a more circular economy by 
eliminating waste and keeping resources and materials 
in use longer. 
• Promoting development, procurement and use of 
sustainable goods, considering whole product lifecycle 
and circular economy principles. 
• Identifying and solving for community-level needs 
at the intersection of broadband access, affordability 
and adoption. 
• Strengthening educational skills offerings and 
institutional relationships to develop innovative 
sustainability solutions. 
• Fostering globally harmonized environmental and 
social standards. 
• Supporting responsible use, while balancing safety and 
innovation in AI. 
• Implementing smart, open data platforms to share 
government data, with privacy safeguards, to develop 
innovative solutions for societal problems. 
Political contributions 
and associations 
Political disclosure and 
accountability policy 
Dell embraces a policy of strict adherence to campaign 
finance laws and regulations that govern political 
contributions and the disclosure of those contributions. 
Dell does not contribute corporate funds to political 
candidates, national political party committees or other 
political committees. 
Dell employees have established the Dell PAC, a separate 
fund or Political Action Committee (PAC) supported solely 
by voluntary contributions from eligible employees and 
spouses of eligible employees who choose to allocate 
contributions to U.S. federal candidates and committees. 
Dell PAC spending reflects company and employee 
interests and the values of the company and not those 
of individual officers or directors. Dell also has a strict 
policy regarding gifts to United States Congressional 
officials. Our Public Policy outlines Dell’s policy on political 
disclosure and accountability and provides details on how 
to review Dell PAC contributions. 
Work with trade associations and 
industry groups 
Each year, Dell conducts a thorough analysis of our 
contracts with trade associations and industry groups. 
This process ensures our relationships with trade 
associations and industry groups align to our priorities and 
ESG goals. As a result of this analysis, we work with trade 
associations to refine their understanding of our objectives 
for the coming year. In addition, we may begin new or end 
existing relationships with trade associations to better 
align with our priorities.

Detailed, three-year performance 
trends on key metrics provide an 
additional layer of transparency into our 
work and progress. 
Each year, we report on material indicators from across 
our business. Some contribute to or directly measure 
progress toward the goals set forth in our ESG plan, while 
others provide additional insight into other business 
indicators relevant to various stakeholders. 
We complement this information with our framework 
reporting per Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
standards, the standards published by SASB and on the 
World Economic Forum’s core Stakeholder Capitalism 
Metrics. Our Reporting Frameworks Index also provides 
mapping of GRI disclosures to the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures’ recommendations. In 
addition, we respond to CDP Water Security and Climate 
Change questionnaires, rounding out our robust global

Year-over-year emissions increases are due in part to improvements in the accuracy of supplier-reported emissions data, which provides 
a more complete view of our upstream supply chain footprint. We continue to incorporate this more accurate supplier-reported emissions 
data into our calculations. We have further refined our calculation methodology and improved quality control processes. 
Our FY22 data does not yet reflect the changes to our calculation methodology that were made in FY23. We are in the process of re-
baselining historical data. Future reporting will reflect this update. 
Our FY24 data is “N/A” due to the one-year lag in receiving suppliers’ data.

recycled, renewable or reusable materials in our packaging. In FY23, we expanded our goal to include where we utilize reused packaging — 
original packaging that has been recollected and reused. However, measurement and reporting capabilities for reused packaging are still in 
development and we now expect to reflect the expanded scope of this goal in future reports. 
We continued pioneering sustainable packaging through innovative renewable material designs, waste reduction efforts like multipack, and 
easy recyclability for customers. We advanced to 96.4% recycled or renewable materials in our packaging, an increase from 94.5% in FY23. 
This metric is used to track progress toward our goal:

We further refined how we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of product sold (in metric tons) in 
FY23. 
In FY24, Dell improved its product recovery rate to 30.1%, a 2.8 percentage point (pp) increase from the previous year. Dell initiatives for 
enabling responsible e-waste disposal and promoting a circular economy for technology products contributed to this change.† 
This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: 
By 2030, for every metric ton of our products a customer buys, one metric ton will be reused or recycled.

396,186,264 
Approximately 396 million people have benefited from our digital inclusion programs, partnerships and innovation in total since FY20, 
including 107 million in FY24 alone. By partnering with schools, governments, nonprofits and private organizations, we are creating an 
ecosystem committed to driving digital inclusion by creating opportunities for underrepresented communities around the world. 
The scope includes the total number of individuals reached directly or indirectly through Dell programs such as regional giving and 
social innovation (e.g., Digital LifeCare). Due to the vast geographical spread of data and limited capacity of partners to verify data at 
the granularity of each beneficiary, our direct and indirect impact metrics are not a unique representation of lives impacted. In FY24, we 
refined our methodology, tracking unique representation for our direct impact. Indirect impact is not tracked uniquely due to the nature 
of the community outreach, and this practice is in line with common measurement and evaluation practices across the industry. Impact 
measurement and reporting is evolving and maturing at a rapid pace. To ensure Dell’s measurement methodology aligns with latest 
industry best practices, Dell will undergo third party analysis on the 1 billion lives goal methodology in FY25. The analysis and adjustments 
as a result of the analysis will be shared and reflected in our FY25 ESG report. 
This metric is used to track progress toward our goal: 
By 2030, we will improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion.

Of the people reached directly through Dell programs such as regional giving and social innovation in FY24, 51.5% identify as girls and

development, and community support tailored to the needs of these underserved populations. 
Percentage of individuals who voluntarily identify as girls, women or members of underrepresented groups within the total number of

accommodation (mental, physical, sensory, cognitive and neurodiverse disability), LGBTQ+ persons, low socioeconomic groups.

leverage digital tools and better serve their communities. 
Currently, this measurement covers the number of nonprofit organizations that have participated in a Pro Bono program. We are developing 
measurements to include nonprofits that are supported through other Dell efforts, including direct business unit giving and those 
organizations that benefit from organic, skill-based employee volunteering. 
Dell has invested in the development of a Digital Assessment Tool that is now available to nonprofits globally. This tool enables nonprofits 
to measure and determine their current digital capacity, identify digital transformation priorities and recommended resources and track 
their progress against those priorities over time. The Digital Assessment Tool was developed by TechSoup, a third-party provider. 
This metric is used to track progress toward a key driver that supports our goal: 
By 2030, 75% of our team members will participate in giving or volunteerism in their communities.

About this report 
This FY24 Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) Report provides 
our stakeholders with a transparent 
view of how we are delivering on our 
commitments. View current and archived 
copies of our reports. 
Reporting year 
This annual report focuses primarily on fiscal year (FY) 
2024 activities, unless otherwise noted. All references to a 
year throughout the report refer to Dell fiscal years, unless 
calendar year (CY) is specified. Our fiscal year is the 52- or 
53-week period that ends on the Friday nearest to January 
31. The fiscal year for this FY24 ESG report ended Friday, 
February 2, 2024. 
Report scope and profile 
The metrics and information presented throughout our 
ESG report address outcomes we are working to achieve 
for Dell Technologies (“Dell,” “we” or “our”). Data for RSA, 
Secureworks, Boomi, Virtustream and Dell Financial 
Services is included where relevant. Data for RSA is 
included only until the date of the divestiture, September 1, 
2020. Data for Boomi is included only until the date of the 
divestiture, October 1, 2021. Data for VMware is excluded 
for all periods presented within this report. Dell completed 
its spin-off of VMware on November 1, 2021. 
Our previous ESG Reports were organized by our four 
ESG pillars: Advancing Sustainability, Cultivating Inclusion, 
Transforming Lives and Upholding Trust. To better align 
our reporting efforts with the broader ESG conversation, 
we have organized this year’s report across six of our most 
material ESG topics: Climate Action, Circular Economy,

Data assurance 
We commissioned an external third party to perform 
limited assurance on FY24 metrics for:  
• Scope 1, 2 and 3 (category 1, 3, 4, 6 and 11) greenhouse 
gas emissions 
• Total energy consumed and percent of electricity 
generated from renewable sources 
• Water withdrawals 
• Percentage of recycled/renewable material content in 
packaging 
• Representation metrics tied to our Inclusive 
Workforce goals* 
Data in this report reflects estimates using methodologies 
and assumptions believed to be reasonable and 
accurate, and may change in the future as a result of new 
information or subsequent developments. 
Restatements of information 
In FY23 we expanded the scope of one of our 2030 
Circular Economy goals to reuse or recycle one metric 
ton for every metric ton of our products a customer buys 
to include products received by all channels, rather than 
only products received by Dell-owned channels, within 
the reporting period. We further refined how we measure 
the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of 
total weight of products shipped, which better aligns with 
industry standards, and more accurately represents the 
collections volumes. In this report, we have restated FY22 
and FY23 using this new methodology to present a more 
meaningful view of our progress. 
The total number of people reached toward our goal to 
improve 1 billion lives through digital inclusion by 2030 
was underreported for FY23. Although the discrepancy in 
the total was relatively small, considering the cumulative 
nature of this metric, we restated the number in order to 
avoid creating a misleading impression of our progress in 
FY24 by attributing more than actually achieved within the 
reporting period. 
Data standardization and 
improvement 
In our ongoing efforts to enhance data accuracy and 
precision, we recognize the need for standardization 
in reporting numerical values. Historically, rounding 
conventions and decimal place consistency have varied 
throughout our reports. Moving forward, it will be standard 
practice to present uniform, comparable and specific data 
whenever possible. This will provide stakeholders with 
more detailed and reliable information. While this objective 
is newly instituted this year, we anticipate full alignment 
within two additional reporting cycles. 
Forward-looking statements 
This report includes estimates, projections and other 
“forward-looking statements,” which generally are identified 
by the words “believe,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” 
“estimate,” “intend,” “strategy,” “future,” “opportunity,” “plan,” 
“may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will 
likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking 
statements are based on current expectations and 
assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
that may cause actual results to differ materially.

ESG goals and key drivers methodology 
Material topic 
Goal 
Metric 
Methodology 
Advancing sustainability 
Climate action 
By 2050, we will achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions across scopes 1, 2 and 3 
MT CO2e of scope 1, scope 2 and 
scope 3 (reported categories) GHG 
emissions 
We focus on reducing direct and indirect emissions in areas with the largest opportunity for impact. Our goal is aligned with the SBTi definition 
of net zero, inclusive of 90% reduction and 10% abatement, and we submitted our net zero goal for SBTi validation in FY24. In accordance with 
the GHG Protocol accounting standards and guidance, we update our emissions methodology as deemed necessary. 
Key Driver: By 2030, we will reduce scopes 1 and 2 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% 
MT CO2e of scope 1 and scope 2 
market-based GHG emissions 
The measurement is the sum of our scope 1 emissions plus the scope 2 market-based emissions. We use the market-based method to 
measure emissions because it exhibits the influence that our renewable electricity purchases have on our emissions footprint. 
Key Driver: By 2030, we will source 75% of electricity 
from renewable sources across all Dell Technologies 
facilities — and 100% by 2040 
Percentage of electricity generated 
from renewable sources 
The quantity of renewable electricity includes purchased electricity for our owned facilities generated from wind, solar, hydroelectric and other 
renewable sources plus renewable electricity generated on-site, such as from solar panels. Calculations follow the RE100 technical criteria in 
addition to the GHG Protocol accounting standards and guidance. 
Key Driver: By 2030, we will reduce absolute scope 3 
GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 
45% 
MT CO2e of scope 3 category 1 
GHG emissions 
To calculate scope 3 category 1 emissions, we use a hybrid method that includes supplier-reported allocated emissions, commodity-level 
emission factors and Environmentally-Extended Input-Output (EEIO) factors to estimate our share of suppliers’ emissions contributions. This 
calculation is run for direct and indirect suppliers, with whom Dell has purchased goods and services from and then totaled to arrive at our 
scope 3 category 1 emissions number. 
Key Driver: By 2030, we will reduce absolute scope 3 
GHG emissions from use of sold products by 30% 
MT CO2e of scope 3 category 11 
GHG emissions 
Calculations for this key driver are done through a two-step process. First, we calculate the aggregate energy footprint for each product type. 
For client, displays, networking and server products, this calculation is based on the lifetime expected energy use for representative models and 
the number of units shipped by country during the reporting period for each of these models. For storage products, this calculation is based 
on the expected lifetime energy use for the representative drives and enclosures shipped during the fiscal year. Second, we calculate country-
specific carbon footprints using International Energy Agency (IEA) published emissions factors. We adjust the IEA emissions factors to account 
for the updates to Global Warming Potential factor differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fourth and Sixth 
Assessment Reports (AR4 and AR6). We sum the country-specific carbon footprints to estimate a worldwide scope 3 category 11 figure for 
Dell’s hardware portfolio. The country-level emissions factors for purchased electricity change regularly. For FY24, this calculation uses the 
2022 estimated emissions factors published by the IEA in 2023. Where those are not available, we use the IEA’s 2021 figures that were also 
published in 2023.

Advancing sustainability 
Circular economy 
By 2030, more than half of our product content will 
be made from recycled, renewable or reduced carbon 
emissions material 
Percentage by weight of recycled, 
renewable and reduced carbon 
emissions content in shipped 
products 
The scope includes of all Dell Technologies-branded products shipped within the reporting period. The measurement is based on the estimated 
amount of recycled and renewable materials as a percentage of total weight of materials used. In FY23 we expanded our goal to include 
reduced carbon emissions material (see the Glossary of this report), and the change is reflected within the reported metrics beginning in FY24. 
By 2030, 100% of our packaging will be made from 
recycled or renewable material, or will utilize reused 
packaging 
Percentage of recycled, renewable 
or reused material content in 
packaging 
The scope includes packaging of all Dell Technologies-branded materials sent to customers. The measurement is based on survey responses 
from packaging suppliers across multiple lines of business, used to determine approximate percentages of total weight of recycled, renewable 
or reusable materials in our packaging. In FY23, we expanded our goal to include where we utilize reused packaging — original packaging that 
has been recollected and reused. However, measurement and reporting capabilities for reused packaging are still in development and we now 
expect to reflect the expanded scope of this goal in future reports. 
By 2030, for every metric ton of our products a customer 
buys, one metric ton will be reused or recycled 
Percentage of product collected 
(percentage by weight of total 
captured for recycling and reuse 
over products sold) 
The scope of this goal includes products received by Dell-owned channels within the reporting period. In FY23, we expanded the scope of this 
goal to include products received by all channels, rather than products received by Dell-owned channels, within the reporting period. We further 
refined how we measure the goal, from units to overall weight, as a percentage of total weight of product sold (in metric tons) in FY23. 
Transforming lives 
Digital inclusion 
By 2030, we will improve 1 billion lives through digital 
inclusion 
Total number of people 
reached (cumulative measurement 
beginning FY20, direct + indirect 
reach) 
The scope includes the total number of individuals reached directly or indirectly through Dell programs such as regional giving and social 
innovation (e.g., Digital LifeCare). Due to the vast geographical spread of data and limited capacity of partners to verify data at the granularity of 
each beneficiary, our direct and indirect impact metrics are not a unique representation of lives impacted. In FY24, we refined our methodology, 
tracking unique representation for our direct impact. Indirect impact is not tracked uniquely due to the nature of the community outreach, and 
this practice is in line with common measurement and evaluation practices across the industry. Impact measurement and reporting is evolving 
and maturing at a rapid pace. To ensure Dell’s measurement methodology aligns with latest industry best practices, Dell will undergo third party 
analysis on the 1 billion lives goal methodology in FY25. The analysis and adjustments as a result of the analysis will be shared and reflected in 
our FY25 ESG report. 
Key Driver: Each year through 2030, 50% of the total 
people directly reached will be those who identify as 
girls and women, or underrepresented groups 
Percentage of people reached 
directly who identify as girls and 
women, or underrepresented 
groups (direct reach only) 
This metric captures the percentage of those who identify as girls, women or underrepresented groups out of the total number of individuals 
directly reached within the reporting year. “Girls” and “women” are individuals who self-identify as female. The term “underrepresented” includes 
but is not limited to the following groups: girls or women, racial/ethnic minorities, beneficiaries requiring an accommodation (mental, physical, 
sensory, cognitive and neurodiverse disability), LGBTQ+ persons, low socioeconomic groups. To ensure our methodology aligns with industry 
best practices, we will be undertaking third-party analysis on our 1 Billion Lives goal methodology in FY25 - inclusive of this key driver. We 
expect any adjustments as a result of the analysis will be reflected in future reports. 
Key Driver: Each year through 2030, we will deliver 
future-ready skills development for workers in our 
supply chain 
Total number of future-ready 
skills training hours at in-house 
manufacturing locations 
The scope is the total future-ready skills training data for all in-house manufacturing locations in our pilot program. 
Total number of future-ready skills 
training hours in supply chain 
The scope is the total future-ready skills training data for two key suppliers in our pilot program.

emissions are calculated from the regional energy grid, 
while market-based emissions align to the contracted 
source of the energy purchased. 
Scope 3 emissions: Indirect greenhouse gas emissions 
that are the result of activities and assets in the value 
chain that are not directly owned or controlled by the 
reporting organization. 
Single-use plastics: Plastic items designed to be used 
once before being disposed of.

American and Hispanic/Latino, that have historically been 
underrepresented in the organization compared to the 
addressable U.S. workforce in the technology industry. 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 
A collection of 17 interlinked global goals, designed to 
be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable 
future for all.” The SDGs were set in 2015 by the U.N. 
General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by the 
year 2030. 
Upcycle: To reduce the consumption of new raw materials 
and prevent wasting potentially useful materials by 
creating a new, useful product. 
Upstream: Refers to the material and service inputs 
needed for the production of goods or services. 
Value chain: A set of activities that a company performs 
to deliver a good or service to a customer. This includes 
operations, upstream and downstream activities. 
Water consumption: Sum of all water that has been 
withdrawn and incorporated into products; used in 
the production of crops or generated as waste; has 
evaporated, transpired, or been consumed by humans or 
livestock; or is polluted to the point of being unusable by 
other users; and is therefore not released back to surface 
water, groundwater, seawater or a third party over the 
course of the reporting period (source: Global Reporting 
Initiative [GRI]). 
Water discharge: Sum of effluents, used water and unused 
water released to surface water, groundwater, seawater or 
a third party, for which the organization has no further use, 
over the course of the reporting period (source: GRI). 
Water risk: The possibility of an entity experiencing 
water-related challenges related to water availability, 
quality or management. Some of these challenges may 
include water scarcity, flooding, pollution, water stress, 
infrastructure decay and drought. 
Water security: The availability, access and sustainable 
management of water resources to meet human 
needs while maintaining the health of ecosystems. It 
encompasses both the quantity and quality of water. 
Water stewardship: The responsible planning and 
management of water and wastewater. 
Water stress: A situation in which the water resources in 
a region or those available to a company are insufficient 
for its needs. For determining water stress, we use the 
WRI Aqueduct Baseline Water Stress indicator. The areas 
considered to be water stressed are those that have 
indicator scores of high or extremely high. 
Water withdrawal: Sum of all water drawn from surface 
water, groundwater, seawater or a third party for any use 
over the course of the reporting period (source: GRI).

An absolute reduction measures the decrease in a company’s GHG emissions by a set quantity within a defined time frame, often 
referred to as a baseline year. 
4 
Scope 2 emissions can be calculated according to two different methodologies—location-based and market-based. Our base-
year inventory includes both a location-based and market-based scope 2 total as required by the GHG Protocol. For reporting, 
we continue to include scope 2 market-based emissions in our target to remain consistent with previous reporting years. GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. 
5 
We use fossil fuels, such as natural gas and propane in some buildings for food preparation, hot water heating and building heating 
and cooling. We use diesel fuel to power backup electrical generators and fire sprinkler booster pumps in some locations, and 
gasoline or diesel in most of our on-site vehicles. 
6 
We currently only have discrete climate action targets for scope 3 categories category 1 and category 11. We review our targets 
regularly and continue to follow guidance from organizations such as the SBTi for additional target-setting strategies. 
7 
Levers are factors that can affect emissions for which we have high, medium, or low levels of influence over. For FY24, our high-
influence levers included telemetry sourced from customer energy usage profiles and design changes within our products. Our 
medium-influence levers included customer demand for compute, data and connectivity resources; product service life; customer 
shift from on-premise to colocations; and customer adoption of renewable energy. Our low-influence levers included changes in 
either the public grid energy mix and projected power consumption.

PAIA was developed in an industry consortium, this streamlined PCF methodology is based on IEC TR 62921 which quantifies GHG 
emissions for ICT systems based on ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. Dell Product Carbon Footprint 
9 
Emissions savings are scope 1 emissions reductions for the sector implementing the solution; scope 2 emissions reductions for 
electricity grid customers; and scope 3 reductions for the organization manufacturing the solution. It is recommended to separately 
calculate carbon emissions savings and report with other activities as a collective effort. 
10 Front-of-meter is on the utility side of the service meter, or the substation level. Voltage optimization is systematic improvement in 
the voltage sent by energy producers to energy consumers, reducing energy use and electricity demand. 
11 Behind the meter is on the customer side of the utility service meter. 
12 IPE is an environmental research organization that collects, collates and analyzes information across a wide range of entities to 
improve governance and disclosure. The CITI Report indicates 742 total companies evaluated for FY24. 
13 Efforts in this area include encouraging suppliers to report data to a pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR), which the 
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development considers a tool for governments to provide data to the public regarding 
the amount of chemicals and pollutants released to air, water and soil transferred off-site for treatment or disposal. For FY24, 271 
of our suppliers reported PRTR. 
14 Using an environmentally-responsible extraction process, Dell recovers gold from used technology and brings it back into the 
circular economy. We no longer use gold in our motherboards, since we have moved to a more sustainable material but we are still 
extracting the gold from e-waste that is returned for Dell to be properly recycled. 
15 NextWave is a collaborative and open-source initiative that brings together multinational technology and consumer brand 
companies, including competitors, across many industries to develop the first commercial-scale ocean-bound plastics supply 
chain. NextWave Plastics. 
16 N50 Partners is a coalition of Fortune 500 companies, NGOs, academic institutions and entrepreneurial ventures. N50 Partners 
share a drive by delivering applications and contents to communities along the outer edge of the digital infrastructure. 
17 Known to be in Dell Technologies supply chain. These include second tier, third tier and beyond. 
18 An audit cycle includes an initial audit and closure audits to confirm that findings from an initial audit have been addressed. 
This improvement is based in factories that improved their initial audit scores between cycles, which is an indicator of 
long-term improvement. 
19 Workers refer to all types of direct employees of the supplier and contract labor, including but not limited to temporary, student and 
dispatch labor. 
20 According to data collected through the Responsible Business Alliance Validated Assessment Program and reported in the RBA 
2022 Annual Report. 
21 Small and diverse spend certificates are validated on an annual basis. 
22 These 11 physical hazards are windstorms, heavy rain, tropical cyclones, cold waves, droughts, riverine flooding, coastal 
flooding, heatwaves, water scarcity, extreme snow and heat stress. Sourced from the 3rd party climate risk tool that Dell uses for 
climate assessments.
