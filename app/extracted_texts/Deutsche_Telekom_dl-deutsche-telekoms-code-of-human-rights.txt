Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 4 of 14 
 
1 Introduction 
 
“Acting responsibly” is an integral part of our corporate strategy and therefore a requirement for all 
employees in our Group. Our core business is all about connecting people, and we are confident that every 
connection we make is an opportunity for sustainable development. For more than two decades, 
environmental and social responsibility have been essential aspects of our day-to-day 
business and integral to our corporate governance. Our core company processes are consistently geared 
toward sustainability. 
 
With this Code of Human Right, the Deutsche Telekom Group undertakes to respect and promote human 
rights and environmental concerns. 
 
This Code of Human Rights is also a component of the policy statement on its human rights to be issued 
by company management in accordance with § 6 (2) of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act  1  and 
can be augmented with supplementary statements as required. To this end, this Code of Human Rights is 
also available to the public. 
 
 
2 Target group and scope  
 
The Code of Human Rights applies to the affiliated companies of Deutsche Telekom AG provided that the 
respective management body has passed a resolution, or the responsible member of management has 
taken a decision on the validity. 
The management of each company is responsible for compliance with this code. No individual or third-party 
rights may be derived from this Code of Human Rights. 
 
 
3 Local adjustments  
 
When this code is implemented in the affiliated companies, the precedence of national and supranational 
law and the cultural norms within this framework, as well as any participation rights of the responsible or 
authorized employee representatives, are to be observed. 
 
In the case of conflict between national law and the content of this code, the central unit responsible for 
Corporate Responsibility (currently Group Corporate Responsibility – DTAG GCR) will work with the 
relevant company to achieve the effect that is as close as possible to the objective of this code. 
 
 
4 Our commitment to respecting human rights and 
environmental concerns 
 
This is our commitment to respecting and promoting human rights and environmental concerns 
everywhere we operate, including our supply chain and business partners:  
 
Deutsche Telekom takes all internationally recognized human rights and environmental concerns 
seriously and acknowledges its corporate responsibility as a global telecommunications company. The 
success of our company is built on our high-quality standards, our integrity, and our values. We ensure

Chains”, in german: Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz „LkSG“ 

 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 5 of 14 
that we always respect human rights and environmental concerns by implementing Group-wide due 
diligence processes, which we systematically refine. 
 
Alongside the legal requirements, we are committed to observing numerous international human rights 
and environment-related reference tools. These are currently:  
▪ „International Bill of Human Rights“, consisting of the „Universal Declaration of Human Rights“, „ 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights“ within which the civil, political, and social rights that 
everyone is entitled to are set out;  
▪ „International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work” 
defining its five basic principles, namely freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right 
to collective bargaining,  elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, effective abolition of 
child labour, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation  and a safe and 
healthy working environment. 
▪  „OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises“ of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development   
▪ principles of UN Global Compact; 
▪ Tripartite declaration of principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy (MNE 
Declaration) 
▪ United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights 
 
5 Our human rights and environment-related principles 
and expectations 
 
The human rights and environment-related principles detailed below provide the basis for all of our 
business activities. They apply in equal measure to our employees and to our suppliers and business 
partners. They outline our values and standards, which are set forth in greater detail in our internal Group 
Policies, procedural instructions und process and thus creating our framework for action. 
 
5.1 Our principles and expectations regarding our employees 
 
We entrench internal regulations and processes aimed at promoting respect for employee rights. These 
include, in particular:  
 
Prohibition of child labor 
We respect the rights of the child. We forbid the use of child labor. All employer practices are, as a minimum, 
to be aligned with the current version of ILO conventions no. 138 and 182 and are to ensure that all 
employees have reached the legal minimum age in accordance with relevant national regulations. 
 
Prohibition of forced labor and all forms of slavery 
We are expressly committed to the prohibition of all forms of forced or compulsory labor and all forms of 
slavery, including modern slavery and trafficking in human beings. All employer practices are, as a 
minimum, to be aligned with the current version of the ILO core labor standards.  
 
Occupational safety and health protection at work 
As an employer, we provide occupational safety and health protection at work for our employees that is at 
least compliant with applicable law, and we support ongoing developments aimed at improving the world 
of work. This includes the implementation of appropriate work organization to prevent excessive physical 
and mental fatigue in terms of working hours and rest breaks. We comply with the regulations on 
occupational safety when using employees from contractor firms. 
 

 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 6 of 14 
Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining 
We recognize the fundamental rights of association and to collective bargaining, as well as the right to 
strike within the framework of national regulations and existing agreements. In addition, we are committed 
to cooperating with legitimate, democratically elected employee representatives in an open and trusting 
manner based on constructive social dialog, with the aim of achieving a fair balance of interests. We will 
not prevent our employees from or restrict them in exercising these rights. We do not accept or tolerate the 
threat of reprisals against employees making use of their right to self-organization.  
 
Prohibition of unequal treatment in employment  
We defend equal opportunities and freedom from discrimination throughout the seven dimensions of 
diversity:1. Age, 2 Gender and gender identity, 3. Ethnic background and nationality, 4. Sexual orientation, 
5. Mental and physical abilities/status, 6. Religion and world view, and 7. Social background (education 
and financial situation of the family of origin).  
With regard to these dimensions, we continually work in support of the removal of systemic barriers to 
inclusion (e.g., in our buildings and IT systems).  
The globally applicable basis for cooperation in the Group is formed by our “Guiding Principles” and our 
“Code of Conduct”.   To further strengthen this basis, we have anchored the issues of diversity, equity, and 
inclusion in our policy of the same name, the “DE&I Group Policy” as well as in our “Leadership Anchors”, 
the DT leadership behavioral guidelines. 
 
Adequate living wage 
We respect the right to a fair and appropriate contractual remuneration that reflects the legal minimum 
wage on the national labor market and that, at the very least, provides our employees with a decent 
standard of living livelihood in terms of the international reference tools mentioned above in section 4.  
 
Zero-tolerance approach to violence or harassment of any sort  
Deutsche Telekom has zero tolerance for physical, psychological or sexual violence, the threat of this, or 
any other type of harassment.  This also applies in relation to the commissioning or use of private or public 
security forces to protect a business project if, due to a lack of instruction or control, the use of security 
forces could lead to a violation of this basic principle.  
 
Training  
The digital world of work is becoming more complex and diverse, and it calls for a great deal of flexibility. 
We support upskilling and reskilling in the interests of both our employees and the company, in order to 
ensure consistently high standards of performance and a high quality of service. The learning formats we 
offer focus in particular on forward-looking future topics that address the increasingly digitalized world of 
work and the workplace challenges and technological, environmental and social change that this brings 
with it. We use digital learning formats that provide the best possible environment for independent, 
flexible learning tailored to the employee’s needs. 
 
5.2 Our principles and expectations regarding our customers 
 
Data protection  
Protecting the personal data of all those who are connected with the Deutsche Telekom Group is a key 
objective for us. 
We ensure the lawful processing of personal data, considering the fundamental human rights. We are 
committed to the fundamental right to data protection and informational self-determination valid in the EU 
and promote its global recognition. We continually enhance technical standards and promote maximum 
transparency. To achieve this, we have comprehensively anchored data protection measures and 
regulations throughout the Group’s processes. This also includes the data-protection-compliant 
determination and consideration of human rights aspects in the development and use of artificial 
intelligence (AI) or other algorithm-based applications.  

 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 7 of 14 
At the same time, we work to ensure that every individual retains control over the use of their data. This 
includes providing information on how data-driven business models work and how, for example, our 
customers can exert digital sovereignty.  
We have introduced a range of internal policies to ensure a uniform high standard of data protection in the 
Group. Of these, the "Binding Corporate Rules Privacy" are the Group-wide data protection regulations to 
which the companies of the Deutsche Telekom Group have committed themselves - as far as legally 
possible. 
 
Freedom of expression and information 
We respect freedom of expression and protect it so that we can prevent or minimize the effects, for 
example, of potential state restrictions. These restrictions must comply with national and/or international 
provisions and legislation and must be necessary and appropriate for achieving the desired objective, for 
example, national security or the protection of children. 
 
Protection of children and young people 
We protect children and young people when they are using digital media and take the relevant criteria for 
the protection of children and young people into account when developing our products and services. 
 
 
5.3 Our principles and expectations regarding society and our 
commitment to environmental protection 
 
Compliance and combating corruption 
Our compliance culture is a key component of corporate governance based on integrity and respect. As a 
Group, we are committed to complying with ethical principles and both legal and statutory requirements. 
We have anchored this pledge in our “Guiding Principles” and our “Code of Conduct”. 
Corruption violates national and international law. We reject all forms of corruption - both bribery as active 
corruption and venality as passive corruption - in the public and private sectors. Any form of corruption as 
well as actions that could be construed as such are to be refrained from.  
 
Digital responsibility and participation 
We strive always to protect and respect human rights in regard to the responsibilities that emerge as a 
result of technological change and the digital transformation. Our objective is for our technology to be 
implemented on the basis of humanist values.  
We are determined to contribute to shaping a digital society that is based on our fundamental democratic 
values and in which all people can participate safely, competently, and with autonomy: We want to make 
the digital world a tolerant, safe space for everyone and enable society to bridge the digital divide. 
 
The rights of local communities and the ability to maintain a livelihood 
We respect and protect the rights of local communities, for example, indigenous peoples. Where our 
activities could affect the people in local communities, we make every effort to avoid negative impacts on 
human rights. We actively consult with the communities that are potentially affected, to achieve 
agreement or consent.  
When we acquire, build on or otherwise use land, forests or waters, the use of which secures the livelihood 
of a person, we are committed to implementing the prohibition of unlawful eviction and taking of land, 
forests and waters.

Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 8 of 14 
Mobile communications and health  
Electromagnetic fields are a key component of our connected world. We ensure compliance with the 
relevant statutory thresholds, based on the recommendations of the International Commission on 
Radiological Protection. The guidelines we have published on the topic of high-frequency electromagnetic 
fields (EMF) provide additional information, outline our approach, and are complemented with an annual 
report on the topic. 
 
Environmental protection 
We are dedicated to environmental protection and contribute in particular to helping mitigate climate 
change and achieving compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Environmental risk assessments are 
an integral component of our environment-related due diligence processes, including during mergers and 
acquisitions. These assessments include all environmental issues on which our business activities may have 
a negative impact, including e.g. actions causing harmful soil changes, water or air pollution, harmful 
noise emission, or excessive water consumption, or deforestation and loss of biodiversity which may 
significantly impair the health and/or the natural bases for livelihood of a person 
 
We avoid waste as far as possible, and promote continued use and reuse and - where this is not possible - 
the priority recycling of waste.  
Within our global supply chain, we pay regard to the prohibited production and/or use of materials covered 
by the Stockholm Convention (persistent organic pollutants – POPs), the non-environmentally 
appropriate handling of waste containing POPs, and the improper shipment of hazardous waste within the 
meaning of the Basel Convention.  
Under the Minamata Convention, the production, use/application and/or disposal of mercury and mercury-
containing wastes is regulated. In order to avoid environmental risks linked to our business activities in this 
regard, we take this into account in our due diligence processes. 
 
Our integrated climate strategy is based on four pillars: Emissions from the value chain; renewable energy; 
energy efficiency; and enablement. We set concrete objectives for each of the four pillars, and report on 
these. We have a group-wide environmental management system, which provides the basis for anchoring 
environmental due diligence. 
 
 
5.4 Our principles and expectations regarding our suppliers  
 
We expect, in particular, the following obligations from direct suppliers with whom we have a contractual 
relationship, and we put appropriate measures in place to ensure that these obligations are met: 
▪ 
For many years, we have expected our suppliers also to commit to respecting human rights and 
environmental concerns, and to observe our principles on these matters (sections 5.1–5.3), to 
undertake to establish appropriate due diligence processes based on risk, and to pass on these 
expectations to their own suppliers.  
▪ 
We establish review processes- if required together with the suppliers - that enable compliance with 
these expectations. 
▪ 
We work in particular to ensure responsible procurement of raw materials throughout our supply chain, 
and therefore require compliance with standards on the handling of metals, especially conflict 
minerals. Beyond that, we support, in particular, initiatives aimed at creating a global system for 
monitoring the origins of minerals, which we consider a useful step towards improving transparency 
throughout our supply chain.

6 Implementation: our human rights and environment-
related due diligence processes 
  
The Deutsche Telekom Group has developed a comprehensive human rights and environment-related due 
diligence program in line with the international reference tools listed in section 4; the program has now 
been in place for a number of years. Based on the knowledge we have acquired, and with the involvement 
of internal and external experts, we have identified groups of people on whom our business activities 
could potentially have a negative or a positive impact (human rights impact assessment):  
• 
Employees in our Group companies  
• 
Employees of our direct or indirect suppliers 
• 
Our customers  
• 
Children and young people  
• 
Members of specific communities  
 
When carrying out our due diligence processes, we therefore pay special attention to the interests of 
particularly vulnerable groups, such as: children, young people, women, migrant workers, and other 
members of national or ethnic, religious, or linguistic minorities. We make sure that this identification of 
vulnerable groups is constantly evolving, and revise it at least once per year after carrying out our annual 
human rights and environment-related risk assessment.  
 
We publish new findings on our website in the annual Deutsche Telekom AG policy statement on the 
human rights strategy and environment-related matters (“Annual report LkSG”)]. 
 
6.1 Risk management anchored in essential business operations 
 
Our Group-wide risk management system implements process steps in all essential business operations, 
with the aim of identifying and minimizing human rights and environment-related risks, and preventing, 
ending or minimizing the extent of violations of environment-related or human rights obligations.  
The Group-wide risk management systems covers all Group companies over which Deutsche Telekom exercises 
decisive influence (in the following “Group-companies”)  
 
The Group-wide key process steps include: 
▪ 
Appointment of the person responsible for monitoring the risk management  
▪ 
Setting up of a complaints procedure  
▪ 
An annual risk analysis for the Group-companies belonging to the own business area and their 
direct suppliers 
▪ 
Ad hoc risk analysis for the entire supply chain, including business partners 
▪ 
And in addition, for direct suppliers: ongoing identification of risks  
▪ 
Derivation and implementation of preventive and remedial action 
▪ 
Audits and effectiveness reviews 
▪ 
Documentation and archiving  
▪ 
Annual reporting 
 
We have defined responsibilities for the exercise of and compliance with our due diligence processes:  
▪ 
At the highest management level, the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG is 
responsible for respecting human rights and environment related obligations.  
▪ 
Regular and/or ad hoc internal reporting on human rights or environment-related results in 
decision-making bodies such as company’s Board of Management means that decisions are always 
informed.

Page 10 of 14 
In a supporting function, one person is appointed to monitor Group-wide due diligence processes on the 
level of Deutsche Telekom AG  (known as the “human rights officer” or the “LkSG  officer”). This person 
reports directly to the Chair of the Board of Management of Deutsche Telekom AG and has further 
supporting functions. 
Where national regulations prescribe this (for example, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act), Group 
companies also appoint this type of supervisory figure for their business area.  
 
6.2  Risk analysis  
 
Our risk management system includes an annual risk analysis aimed at determining human rights and 
environment-related risks. The risk analysis is carried out for the Group-companies and their direct suppliers 
for the financial year in question. When considering and assessing risks, we pay particular attention to the 
interests of any persons affected/injured.  
 
A risk exists where there are at least actual indications that suggest that a violation of human rights-related 
or environment-related obligations in terms of section 4 may be possible or that a specific violation has in 
fact taken place and that a Group-company has caused or contributed to this. Such a risk may also arise 
from violations that have already occurred due to a breach of human rights or environmental obligations, 
insofar as the repetition of the facts could not be mitigated by means of appropriate preventive measures. 
 
Alongside the annual risk analysis, additional ad hoc risk analyses are carried out in cases where we have 
actual indications that a risk of the type outlined above is possible or  if we must expect a significantly 
changed or expanded risk situation in the supply chain.. This applies to all Group-companies, direct 
suppliers and indirect suppliers that are known to us, and other business partners.  
 
Prior to a merger or acquisition, human rights and environment-related risks are also systematically 
analyzed. 
 
The key process steps in a regular risk analysis are: 
 
Step 1: Identifying  Group-companies/branches/sites in our own business area, as well as their direct 
suppliers, with a higher propensity to risk by 
- 
Comparing external and internal information and sources 
- 
Mapping country-specific political conditions (e.g., risk mapping by business areas, sites, products, 
or countries of origin) 
- 
Looking at material group-specific and product-specific risks to analyze risk in relation to suppliers. 
 
Our sources for this are public reports on country and sector risks, internal information from management 
processes we have in place such as complaints procedures, risk questionnaires in the Group-companies, 
employee surveys, audits, and certifications. We also incorporate internal and external human rights 
expertise from expert, business partners, and selected stakeholders, including representatives of groups 
that are or could be affected.  
To identify direct suppliers that are susceptible to risk, we also use risk data from specialist external 
providers. This allows us to continually monitor our global supplier chains on the basis of risk, and to carry 
out an ongoing assessment based on a range of publicly available sources.  
 
We increasingly endeavor to identify particularly vulnerable groups (such as children, ethnic and religious 
minorities, defenders of human rights, women, or indigenous peoples) and to analyze the human rights 
risks facing them in greater detail. 
 
Step 2: Carrying out a plausibility check of the results of Step 1 and weighting and prioritizing concrete 
human 
rights 
and 
environment-related 
risks 
in 
a 
specific 
context 
in 
the 
companies/branches/sites/suppliers as part of a cross-departmental risk dialog. An expert committee 

 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 11 of 14 
consisting of the central specialized departments and the risk management supervisory figures (Supply 
Chain Act Risk Board) carries out a plausibility check and the weighting and prioritizing of risks within a joint 
risk dialog.  
All findings (risks and violations) are evaluated as increasing or minimizing risk and are translated into a 
points scale, and in the next step, they are prioritized based on following criteria of adequacy e.g.  
 
▪ 
Nature and extent of the business activity: “Material group classification” (e.g., material groups 
in which raw materials are used that are demonstrably mined in conflict or high-risk regions or 
that are generally associated with violations of human rights or environmental damage; the use of 
dangerous machines and/or chemicals in the manufacture of (upstream) products; production 
using a high proportion of low-skilled manual labor, migrant workers, remote/hardly accessible 
workplaces, and/or a seasonal/fluctuating demand for workers) 
▪ 
Ability to influence the party who is directly responsible 
▪ 
The severity of the violation that can typically be expected and the probability of occurrence of 
the violation: number of persons affected, existence of effective prevention measures  
▪ 
Causal contribution: party who is directly/indirectly responsible 
 
The risk matrix or risk scale that is compiled on this basis each year, and that distinguishes between 
companies/suppliers with a high, medium or low risk of human rights violations or environmental damage, 
is approved by the Group Board of Management and forms the basis for deriving further measures, as well 
as internal and external communication, and is included in corporate decision-making processes. 
 
We use the results as the basis for compiling and, where necessary, adapting internal provisions, processes, 
and training, to respond to the evolving demands on our due diligence processes. 
 
6.3 Preventive measures  
 
If a high risk is identified and prioritized during a risk analysis, we immediately take appropriate, risk-
based preventive measures, such as: 
 
For our own Group-companies (own business area): 
We put policies and guidelines in place to implement our human rights and environment-related strategies, 
and adapt these as necessary. They include e.g.:  
▪ Code of Human Rights  
▪ Code of Conduct 
▪ Description of Due-Diligence Risk Management  
▪ Global Procurement Policy 
▪ Management system for quality, health, safety, and environmental protection 
▪ Environmental guideline 
▪ Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Group Policy 
 
In addition, we carry out on-site training and risk-based control measures, for example, human rights 
impact assessments, as well as internal and external auditing on site. 
 
In relation to suppliers: 
Our human rights and environment-related principles and expectations regarding direct suppliers have 
been a fundamental element of our contracts for many years, and are taken into account in the selection 
of suppliers. 
In addition, we take further appropriate risk-based measures, such as contractual guarantees, including the 
establishment of suitable control mechanisms e.g.: 
▪ 
Agreeing on special contractual clauses for carrying out risk-based control measures such as 
supplier audits, support of the direct supplier in the implementation of measures towards direct 
suppliers in connection with risks identified  

 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Code of Human Rights – Deutsche Telekom AG – as of: Dec. 1st, 2023 
Page 12 of 14 
▪ 
Offering training on our human rights and environmental expectations  
▪ 
Participation in cross-sector initiatives 
 
We have a range of control mechanisms in place for annual or ad hoc monitoring of the effectiveness of 
preventive measures that we have implemented in our own business area or for our direct or indirect 
suppliers, and we update these measures as necessary. These effectiveness and control mechanisms 
include e.g.: 
▪ 
Checking the implementation of Group Policies by means of a survey in the Group-companies 
within an annual risk assessment  
▪ 
Carrying out employee surveys 
▪ 
Monitoring the participation rate in training courses 
▪ 
Carrying out internal and external audits and certification  
 
6.4 Remedial action  
If, on the basis of our risk analysis, we establish that a violation of our human rights or environment-related 
obligations has already occurred or is imminent, we immediately take appropriate remedial actions and 
prioritize them if required in accordance with the adequacy criteria described in section 6.2.:  in particular, 
the following remedial action:  
 
For our own Group-companies (own business area) in particular: 
▪ 
Immediate measures with the aim to prevent, end or minimize the extent of violation 
▪ 
Holding training courses 
▪ 
Supplementing policies and adjusting processes 
▪ 
Taking measures under labour law 
▪ 
Involving additional specialist units and employees’ representation bodies to work on a concept 
 
The aim of the remedial action is to end the violation.  
 
In relation to suppliers: 
In regard to our direct suppliers, we make immediate contact, discuss the situation and call for behavior 
that is violating human rights or environment-related obligations to be stopped. If it will not be possible to 
end the violation in the foreseeable future, we are ready to come to an agreement with the supplier on a 
joint concept to end or minimize the violation, including a concrete timetable. To do this, we also call on 
external partners and sector initiatives.  
If it is or becomes clear that the supplier will not meet the demands, we consider the temporary suspension 
of the business relationship and/or the removal of the supplier from contract award lists. If the violation is 
serious and/or cannot be ended, then termination of the business relationship is considered as a last resort. 
Given that we have no contractual relationship with indirect suppliers, in case of violations, we will first 
make contact with our direct supplier, if necessary, an in scope of the possible. In such cases, too, we strive 
to work with all those involved to come up with a concept to prevent, end or minimize the violation, and to 
work together to implement this concept. We also look into participation in relevant sector initiatives.  
 
We have a range of control mechanisms in place to check at least once per year or on an ad hoc basis 
the effectiveness of the remedial action described above. These effectiveness and control mechanisms 
include: 
▪ 
Adding specific questions to employee surveys 
▪ 
Monitoring the participation rate in training courses 
▪ 
Carrying out internal and external audits and certification

6.5 Documentation and annual reporting 
 
We continually document our endeavors to effectively implement our due diligence obligations.  
In addition to the human rights and environmental strategy published in this Group Policy, Deutsche 
Telekom AG also publishes further reports on meeting its due diligence obligations. These are currently: 
 
▪ 
An annual Policy Statement on possible priority human rights and environment-related risks at 
Deutsche Telekom AG after the annual risk analysis has been carried out in accordance with the 
Supply Chain Due Diligence Act. The Policy Statement is published on our website  - “Annual report 
LkSG” 
▪ 
An annual report on sustainability in accordance with the relevant applicable statutory 
sustainability reporting obligations 
 
7 Internal complaints procedure  
 
Our Group-wide whistleblower portal TellMe provides all interest groups with the possibility to report, 
among other things, grievances regarding human rights or environmental concerns related to Deutsche 
Telekom, and to make us aware of these issues. 
 
The public can access the procedure through our homepage and via the websites of the Group-companies. 
To ensure the widest possible accessibility of the complaints procedure, concerns and complaints can be 
expressed in a variety of ways:  
 
▪ 
By telephone, using the free international service number  
 +8000 3824835 
▪ 
By email:         tell-me@telekom.de 
▪

53113 Bonn, Germany 
▪ 
Anonymous online reporting 
 
All concerns raised will be recorded by our trained Compliance staff to be dealt with as prescribed by law 
and with all due consideration to protecting the person making the complaint. As a rule, confirmation that 
the concern or complaint has been received will be sent within seven days, together with a point of contact 
for the next steps in the procedure. Our team of experts will assess the validity of the concern raised and 
assign further responsibilities. For clarification of facts, if necessary and in consultation with the person 
making the complaint, it may make sense to involve other parties. Our aim is to communicate the result and 
any measures that have been derived from the complaint to the person making the complaint within 
approximately three months of sending the confirmation of receipt. 
 
We continually, and at least once per year, monitor the effectiveness of the complaints procedure and 
develop the procedure as necessary. Findings from the complaints procedure are taken into consideration 
in our annual risk analysis and can be a catalyst for carrying out an ad hoc risk analysis. In addition, we 
examine the further initiation of measures by exhausting the respective legal possibilities, e.g. steps under 
labor law and/or criminal law.
