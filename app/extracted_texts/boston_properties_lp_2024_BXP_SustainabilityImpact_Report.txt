SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT REPORT

In 2024 we continued to conduct our business, the 
development and operation of new and existing buildings, 
in a manner that contributes to positive outcomes for 
our clients, shareholders, employees, and the communities 
we serve. Across our portfolio, we remain focused on the 
discovery and implementation of cost-effective initiatives 
that conserve resources, control expenses, and improve 
the resilience and sustainability of the cities where 
we operate.  
Sustainability is a smart business strategy that aligns with 
principles of fiscal responsibility, economic growth, and 
long-term value creation. Conservation efforts, including 
retro-commissioning, demand response, and heat recovery, 
help offset escalating operating costs. The integration 
of sustainable design and operating principles – from LEED 
and ENERGY STAR to clean energy and low-carbon 
building materials – helps attract certain clients seeking 
healthy, high-performance premier workplaces. Through 
performance and risk management processes, we are more 
prepared to minimize regulatory and transition-related 
risks. In totality, we believe the thoughtful approaches 
we have taken, outlined in this Sustainability & Impact 
report, make BXP a stronger and more profitable company.

SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT REPORT
CONTENTS

We actively work to promote our growth and operations 
sustainably and responsibly across our six regions. The 
BXP Sustainability and Impact (S&I) strategy is to conduct 
our business, the development and operation of new and 
existing buildings, in a manner that contributes to positive 
economic, social, and environmental outcomes for our 
clients, shareholders, employees, and the communities 
in which we operate.
Our investment philosophy is shaped by our core strategy 
of long-term ownership and our commitment to our 
communities and the centers of commerce and civic life 
that make them thrive. We are focused on developing 
and maintaining healthy, high-performance buildings, while 
simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the 
potential external impacts of energy, water, waste, GHG 
emissions, and climate change.
BXP and its employees also make a positive social impact 
through charitable giving, volunteerism, and public realm 
investments.
We continue to address the needs of our stakeholders by 
making efforts to maintain and improve our S&I performance 
across three pillars: climate action, resilience, and social 
good. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating 
and developing commercial real estate can be conducted 
with a conscious regard for the environment and wider 
society while mutually benefiting our stakeholders.

SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT REPORT
CONTENTS

The intent of this report is to present information related to 
S&I performance indicators in a format that is understandable 
and accessible. BXP’s reporting is with reference to the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the United Nations SDGs, 
and the Sustainability Accounting Standards (SASB). 
BXP continues to focus on full alignment with the Task 
Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
recommendations.
This report is focused on the performance of our total 
in-service portfolio in our Boston, Los Angeles, New York, 
San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC regions 
from January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024. For questions 
regarding BXP's 2024 S&I Report, please contact 
sustainability@bxp.com. 
Actively Managed Office Portfolio 
Key Performance Indicator (KPI) data related to energy, 
water, waste, and our building certification target reflect 
the performance of our occupied actively managed 
office building portfolio across our six regions. Occupied 
office buildings are defined as buildings with no more 
than 50% vacancy. Actively managed office buildings are 
those over which we have operational control of building 
system performance and investment decisions and are 
occupied by more than one client. By concentrating on 
similarly situated buildings, we can meaningfully benchmark 
performance and measure the efficacy of our sustainability 
measures. Unless otherwise noted, all data presented in 
this report relate to occupied and actively managed office 
buildings as specified above. Over time, we will continue 
to assess available data and determine whether, and 
if so, when we can expand this report to address other 
property types and information.
At the end of 2024, BXP's total in-service portfolio totaled 
54.4 million gross square feet (SF) and 178 buildings. BXP’s 
actively managed office portfolio totaled 39.6 million SF 
and 75 buildings, accounting for 73% of the Company's 
total in-service portfolio by area.

MEANINGFUL PARTNERSHIPS  |  In November 2024, BXP participated in the Berkeley Real Estate Club Summit at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. 
Rod Diel, BXP's West Coast EVP,  joined a distinguished panel to discuss the current state of commercial real estate. Abby Dong, Property Manager at 
Salesforce Tower, moderated the panel. The conversation highlighted BXP’s collaboration with the City of San Francisco to reimagine the Embarcadero, 
showcasing a transformative initiative to enhance the waterfront’s vibrancy and connectivity. This event reflects BXP’s commitment to innovation and 
meaningful partnerships within our communities.
We seek to understand the views and priorities of 
our stakeholders by engaging our shareholders, supply 
chain, clients, employees, communities, and partners 
throughout the lifecycle of our activities. BXP management 
identifies and seeks to understand the groups and 
organizations that may affect or be affected by a decision, 
activity, or outcome of a project. During stakeholder 
engagement processes, we work closely with our clients, 
vendors, and service providers to gather knowledge, 
plan, and implement design solutions, technologies, and 
programs that drive improvement in KPIs. We regularly 
participate in public forums during the development process 
to seek community input and apply green building standards 
to manage our supply chain. In our communities, we actively 
participate in business improvement districts (BIDs), 
associations, nonprofits, and other civic engagement 
activities intended to strengthen public-private partnerships 
and advance sustainability at the neighborhood scale.
We are directly engaged with several third-party suppliers 
for the procurement of materials and services required 
for the construction of new development projects and the 
ongoing operation of our existing buildings. BXP requires 
all service providers and contractors to comply with 
applicable laws relating to the payment of wages and benefits, 
worker health and safety, interactions with labor organizations, 
and other workplace laws such as non-discrimination, 
proper classification of employees, and maintenance of 
insurance. With respect to the use of unionized labor, 
BXP is committed to a position of neutrality, guided by 
the interests of its partners, investors, and clients.
We continue to engage investors on S&I issues, with a 
particular focus on environmental performance and outcomes 
that matter most to them and our other stakeholders. 
Sustainability-focused investor engagement in 2024 reached 
more than 79 firms (more than 100 individual investors) 
and was conducted through BXP's third annual virtual S&I 
Investor Update and several one-on-one meetings with 
S&I-focused investors.

GREEN LEASING IN GREEN BUILDINGS  |  In Q4 2024, BXP announced a long-term lease renewal with Ropes & Gray for approximately 413,000 SF at the 
Prudential Tower located at the Prudential Center through 2041, which includes the most up-to-date green lease language covering the next 17 years. The 
Prudential Tower earned ENERGY STAR certification in 2024 and continues to operate efficiently with the help of our clients.
THE PRUDENTIAL CENTER  
BOSTON, MA
The environmental impact of our in-service portfolio 
depends on the behavior of our clients. Effective engagement 
with our clients is critical for the successful execution of 
our sustainability strategy. We have integrated sustainability 
into our property management practices, executive 
leadership and regional annual goals, leasing and construction 
documents, client improvement guidelines, and our 
routine meetings with existing and prospective clients. In 
addition to client meetings, we survey regularly to collect 
feedback regarding client satisfaction. We believe that by 
developing green buildings we maximize the likelihood of 
sustainable performance and through effective stakeholder 
engagement, we can align efforts toward positive economic, 
social, and environmental outcomes.
We recognize and have taken steps to address the role of 
our clients in supporting the execution of our sustainability 
strategy through our leasing activity. Approximately half 
of our active lease agreements incorporate "green lease" 
language, and all our Master Lease forms for new leasing 
include "green lease" language. BXP has been named 
a Green Lease Leader at the Platinum level by the Institute 
for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of 
Energy for exhibiting a strong commitment to high 
performance and sustainability in buildings, implementing 
social priorities and policies, and exhibiting best practices 
in leasing. To align our sustainability efforts with our clients, 
our Master Lease forms include cost recovery for capital 
expenditures made to reduce operating expenses, cost 
recovery for certifications (including LEED and ENERGY 
STAR), sub-metering of high-intensity client equipment, 
and required client energy disclosure (benchmarking). 
Our legal counsel and leasing teams negotiate our 
leases with the intent of preserving green lease clauses 
without alterations or exceptions.

BXP conducts periodic materiality assessments to identify 
the material economic, social, and environmental issues 
that impact our business and that are important to our 
stakeholders. We first conducted this assessment in 2016, 
and we refreshed our materiality assessment in 2019 and 
2022, with more input from stakeholders, including clients, 
investors, community members, and a randomly selected 
group of BXP employees. The results of these materiality 
assessments are based solely on the importance of 
these topics to our stakeholders and are primarily used 
to establish and/or inform S&I-related performance 
indicators in our organization, prioritize resources, and 
determine the contents of this report. 
This report prioritizes the following material topics based 
on the assessment results: economic performance; 
resource use; energy; GHG emissions; water; waste; 
customer satisfaction; public transportation; climate 
preparedness and resilience; green building; local 
community impact; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and 
the health, safety, and wellness of our clients and 
employees. In recent years, there has been rising interest 
in S&I issues from our stakeholders, particularly related 
to healthy buildings and climate action. This report includes 
more information detailing BXP’s efforts to address 
these important issues.

Our sustainability goals establish targets for energy, GHG emissions, building certifications, water consumption, and waste. We achieved our first 
round of energy, emissions, and water targets three years ahead of schedule in 2016, our second emissions reduction target in 2019, and our 
second energy and water targets in 2022. In 2024, we set new energy, GHG emissions, and water targets. By resetting company-wide goals, we 
seek to increase stakeholder awareness and endeavor to drive continuous year-over-year, like-for-like key performance indicator improvement. 
We have adopted goals with the following specific time frames, metrics, and targets below the noted baseline years:
Goals & Progress
1
GOALS & PROGRESS
Reduce energy use intensity, targets 
a 42% reduction by 2030. Units are 
kBtu/SF.2,3
42x30 Energy Use 
Reduction Goal
STATUS: In Progress
NOTES: In 2023, we officially achieved our energy use reduction goal 
and have since worked to set a new reduction goal. This new energy 
reduction goal sets an updated reduction target of 42% by 2030. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have decreased energy consumption 
39% when compared to the 2008 baseline year. The continued 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on physical occupancy have resulted 
in a significant decrease in energy use intensity. We expect the intensity 
to rebound over time, therefore; we will not claim full completion of the 
goal until building repopulation stabilizes.

decreased Scope 3 - Category 1: Purchased Goods & Services and 
Category 13: Downstream Leased Assets 66% when compared to the 
2018 baseline year. The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 
on physical occupancy have resulted in a significant decrease in GHG 
emissions intensity. We expect the intensity to rebound over time, 
therefore; we will not claim full completion of the goal until building 
repopulation stabilizes. See Page 36 for our full Scope 3 emissions

BXP is a corporate member of the USGBC and has a long 
history of owning, developing, and operating properties 
that are certified under USGBC’s global LEED Green Building 
Rating System. LEED is a voluntary, consensus-based 
national standard of design guidelines for high-performance 
and sustainable buildings. Since 2008, BXP has certified 
more than 34.9 million square feet (64%) of our total 
in-service office portfolio, of which 91% is certified at the 
highest Gold and Platinum levels.
LEED For Operations and Maintenance (LEED O+M)
Green building certification of our existing properties is 
an important component of our strategy to achieve 
operational sustainability. BXP continues to actively pursue 
LEED O+M certification across our portfolio and has 
a Company-Wide Sustainable Operations Committee 
dedicated to sharing best practices. Using the LEED 
rating system and the Arc platform, we are using performance 
scoring to benchmark new LEED O+M projects across 
five performance areas: energy, water, waste, transportation, 
and human experience. Currently, we have certified 
24 of our total in-service properties under the LEED O+M 
program totaling 18.9 million square feet, or 35% of our 
total in-service portfolio. 
LEED For Communities and LEED For Neighborhood 
Development (LEED ND)
BXP certified Reston Town Center in Reston, VA, under 
the LEED for Communities scorecard. This 3.4 million 
square foot mixed-used development area earned 
Platinum certification. In addition, the next phases of 
BXP’s Reston Town Center development have also 
earned LEED ND – Gold certification.

life sciences building will be BXP’s first life sciences development with electric heating systems that eliminate onsite fossil fuel combustion. The project will 
also provide bike hub facilities with an in-house repair shop, an expansive conference and fitness amenity, and plentiful access to daylight and fresh air via 
outdoor terraces along the exterior of the building. In addition to these green building design strategies, the optimal Kendall Square location provides access 
to a series of urban green spaces, a landscaped public plaza, and walkability to the MBTA subway system, and the development project includes a robust 
high school training and education program for local students.
Building Materials
As part of our commitment to developing LEED projects, 
sustainability criteria inform the building materials 
selection process. These criteria, aligned with the LEED 
rating system, support sustainable construction material 
procurement, green building delivery, conservation of 
natural resources, waste reduction, and occupant health. 
Project teams review vendor disclosures and aim 
to cost-effectively procure building materials that are:
•	 Lower embodied carbon and lower global warming 
potential,
•	 Extracted, harvested, recovered, and manufactured 
within 500 miles of the project site,
•	 Composed of the maximum possible recycled content,
•	 Third-party validated sustainably harvested wood 
products, and
•	 Non-toxic and supportive of healthy, productive indoor 
environments containing no volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs), urea-formaldehyde, and/or other chemicals 
of concern.
Whole Building Life Cycle Assessments
BXP performs whole building life cycle assessments 
(WBLCA) on large development projects to evaluate 
the environmental impacts of a building across its entire 
lifecycle, from material extraction to demolition, 
encompassing both embodied and operational carbon.
Green Building Education
Maintaining and strengthening BXP’s internal green 
design, construction, and operations capabilities and 
knowledge base is a key aspect of the Company’s 
overall environmental strategy. Ongoing training and 
education of our employees is essential to sustainable 
operations and growth. We have made a concerted 
effort to train and accredit our managers and staff in 
green design, construction, and operations. Over 
80 employees across our development, construction, 
and property management departments are LEED 
Accredited Professionals or Green Associates. In addition, 
100 employees have received Green Professional 
(GPRO) Operations & Maintenance building skills training, 
a program that is endorsed by the USGBC. In sum, 
these employees represent 47%1 of all employees in their 
respective departments. Our trained property management 
professionals are equipped to effectively engage clients 
to promote more sustainable client behavior and 
discover opportunities.

SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT REPORT
CONTENTS

BXP is a leading REIT in the issuance of green bonds. BXP 
has marketed and issued an aggregate principal amount of 
$5.1 billion of green bonds in six separate bond offerings 
and has provided impact reporting for each. BXP will issue 
updated Green Bond Reports as needed.
Green bonds restrict the use of proceeds to “Eligible 
Green Projects," which are defined as: (1) investments 
in acquisitions of buildings; (2) building developments or 
redevelopments; (3) renovations in existing buildings; 
and (4) client improvement projects, in each case, that 
have received, or are expected to receive, in the three 
years prior to the issuance of the notes or during the 
term of the notes, a LEED Gold or Platinum certification 
(or environmentally equivalent successor standards). 
Sustainability-Linked Credit Facility
On June 15, 2021, Boston Properties Limited Partnership 
(BPLP) entered its 2021 Credit Facility, which features a 
sustainability-linked pricing component such that if 
the Company meets certain sustainability performance 
targets, the applicable per annum interest rate will be 
reduced by one basis point. The sustainability-linked pricing 
component informed the creation of BXP’s 87x25 
Building Certification Goal, which targets an increase in 
building certifications, including ENERGY STAR, LEED, and 
Fitwel from 77% to 87% by 2025. In 2023, BXP exceeded 
this goal with 91% of our actively managed office 
portfolio certified under at least one rating system, and 
further increased this metric to 96% in 2024.1 
Onsite Solar Power Purchase Agreements
BXP has financed the installation of solar photovoltaic 
(PV) onsite renewable energy systems with power 
purchase agreements (PPAs) since 2010. Under a PPA 
contract, a counterparty designs, finances, builds, 
owns, operates, and maintains the renewable energy 
system. BXP agrees to host the system and purchase 
power generated by the system from the counterparty 
over the contract term. Advantages of the PPA delivery 
model include no significant upfront costs to BXP, energy 
cost savings over the contract term, and the ability 
to capture the indirect economic benefit of monetized 
federal tax credits. As of December 31, 2024, BXP has 
executed 14 onsite solar PPAs across our entire portfolio.

At BXP, we believe we can play a leading role in advancing 
the transition to a low-carbon economy through our 
climate action efforts. As a long-term owner and active 
manager of real estate assets in operation and under 
development, we take a long-term view of climate change 
risks and opportunities. We are focused on understanding 
how climate change may impact the performance of our 
portfolio and the steps we can take to increase climate 
resilience. We continue to evaluate the potential risks 
associated with climate change that could impact our 
portfolio and are taking proactive steps to plan for and/or 
mitigate such risks.
Task Force On Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD)
We have aligned our climate-related disclosures with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD framework has 
informed the development of our strategy for identifying 
and managing both physical and transition risks associated 
with climate change. As defined by the TCFD framework, 
physical risks associated with climate change include 
acute risks (extreme weather-related events), chronic 
risks (extreme heat and sea-level rise), and transition 
risks such as policy and legal risks, and other technology, 
market, and reputation-related risks.

Governance
Various roles assessing and managing climate-related 
risks, opportunities, and initiatives are spread across 
multiple teams throughout our organization, including our 
Board of Directors and executive leadership, in addition 
to our Sustainability, Risk Management, Development, 
Construction, and Property Management Departments. 
BXP has a dedicated team of sustainability professionals 
focused on S&I issues that coordinate and collaborate 
across corporate and regional teams to advance 
environmental sustainability issues and initiatives. As a 
vertically integrated, full-service real estate company, 
we are engaged in addressing climate-related issues at all 
levels of our Company. In 2021, our Board of Directors 
established a Board-level Sustainability Committee to, 
among other things, increase Board oversight over 
sustainability issues, including climate-related risks and 
opportunities. The Sustainability Committee directly 
reports to the full Board of Directors on matters related 
to the environment, sustainability, climate change, 
and resiliency.
Our approach to climate-related issues is informed by 
robust stakeholder engagement. We are in frequent 
dialogue with investors, clients, community members, 
governmental policymakers, consultants, and other 
non-governmental organizations. We are heavily involved 
in industry associations and participate in conferences 
and workshops covering sustainability and climate resiliency 
topics. Through these engagements, we enhance our 
knowledge of climate-related issues and those issues that 
are most important to our stakeholders as well as industry 
best practices.
Strategy
We continue to proactively assess the potential risks 
that may impact the properties in our portfolio, but 
our assessment and analysis remain preliminary as we 
gather information and monitor the evolving regulatory 
landscape related to climate change. Our process for 
assessing climate-related risks and their implications on 
our properties and business includes conducting climate 
change scenario analysis on our portfolio assets. In 2024, 
we engaged First Street, an independent provider of 
science-driven insights and analytics on climate risk, for 
its climate risk scoring to evaluate the forward-looking 
physical climate risk exposure of our entire portfolio. The 
scenario analysis and physical risk scoring was based 
on an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, which is a worst-case, 
high-emissions scenario, under a time horizon up to 2054. 
The scenario analysis examined all in-service assets owned 
by BXP and included climate events such as flood, wind, 
wildfire, hail, extreme heat, air quality, and drought. We are 
also using climate risk data to identify potential risks 
during the new acquisition diligence process. The analysis 
of our portfolio yielded no material findings.
We consider climate-related risks and opportunities 
in the context of the following time horizons: short-term 
(1-2 years), medium-term (3-10 years), and long-term 
(>10 years). Based on the foregoing process for evaluating 
climate-related risks, including the scenario analysis, 
we have identified (1) the following potential physical and 
transition risks associated with climate change that could 
impact our portfolio in the future across the stated time 
horizons and (2) BXP’s climate-related opportunities. 
We will continue to analyze the results of climate risk 
analyses, including the following risks and opportunities 
to understand our potential exposure and inform our 
climate resilience strategy and future investments, which 
include climate-related risk mitigation and initiatives.

Increased severity of extreme weather events, including flooding and wind damage, extreme heat, and sea-level rise may cause one or more of the 
following to occur:
Non-compliance with regulatory requirements, including energy and carbon performance standards, may increase costs and/or introduce potential fines.
Compliance with green building codes, including electrification of heating systems, may increase development and operational costs.
Failure to meet the sustainability needs (e.g., net-zero requirements) of clients and investors could result in lost business.
Additional growth, particularly in life sciences, may increase energy and emissions intensities.
Energy and carbon reductions could result in greater product differentiation and competitive advantage.
Stronger S&I disclosures, particularly regarding climate action and resilience, may qualify BXP for greater inclusion in S&I ETFs and other funds.
BXP may benefit from a lower cost of capital from green bonds and/or sustainability-linked credit.
BXP may avoid operating cost increases from rising energy costs through actions focused on efficient operations.
Building adaptation, including architectural and mechanical improvements, could increase capital expenditure requirements.
Extreme drought and wildfires could adversely impact demand in markets prone to water scarcity and annual wildfire risk.
Sea-level rise and extreme weather events could make property insurance unavailable in high-risk areas.
Public transportation system disruptions could impact access to BXP buildings.
Chronic climate-related physical risks and associated downtime could result in declining demand for office space at impacted buildings.
Real estate taxes may increase because of public projects to improve regional and neighborhood-scale resilience.
BXP may avoid penalties associated with building energy and carbon performance standards.
Assets may be converted and/or certified net-zero, which may increase demand for office space.
By focusing on the risks of climate change associated with acute and chronic physical risks during the development, acquisition, and operating life of 
assets, BXP may mitigate losses and downtime resulting from extreme weather events.

Climate Risk Management
BXP is committed to managing the avoidable and avoiding 
unmanageable impacts of climate change. Our risk 
management program includes physical and transition risks, 
including both climate mitigation (resource efficiency 
and emissions reduction) and adaptation (integration of 
climate resilience into our investment decision-making). 
We are actively acquiring, developing, and operating a 
geographically diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial 
real estate properties. Individual assets have unique risk 
profiles and insurance requirements. Through the processes 
of acquisition, development, and operation of our in-service 
portfolio, our experienced real estate professionals are 
identifying risks, including business continuity risks, loss 
exposure related to extreme weather events, and 
impacts of regulation, such as permitting requirements, 
codes, and energy and carbon performance standards. 
The climate risk profile of each property is largely dependent 
on the property’s unique attributes, physical location, 
and jurisdictional regulatory requirements.
Asset-Level Risk Management
We carry all-risk property insurance on our properties 
including those under development. Insurance coverage 
mitigates the impact on BXP from losses associated with 
natural catastrophes, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, 
and wind events. 
We are preparing for long-term climate risk by considering 
climate change scenarios and continue to assess 
climate change vulnerabilities resulting from potential 
future climate scenarios and sea-level rise. We continue 
to evaluate existing plans and procedures and proactively 
implement practical, cost-effective resiliency measures 
and infrastructure enhancements, including:
•	 Business Continuity Plans,
•	 Emergency Response and Life Safety Plans,
•	 Emergency evacuation planning, procedures, 
and drills,
•	 Client engagement and coordination,
•	 Life safety analysis,
•	 Elevation of vault, switchgear, and critical equipment 
during new development,
•	 Waterproofing of subgrade infrastructure,
•	 Floodable first floors,
•	 Temporary flood barriers,
•	 Backup generation, emergency lighting, and 
fire pumps, and
•	 Onsite energy resources and distributed generation, 
storage, and solar PV systems.
Our exposure to physical climate risks and the resilience 
of our markets may depend on the actions taken by cities 
to adapt transportation, energy, and communication 
infrastructure for extreme heat, weather events, sea-level 
rise, and flooding. We will continue to influence the 
adaptation of our cities and management of physical and 
transition risks by maintaining a voice in policy decision-
making at the local level through direct engagement and/or 
advocacy through collective membership-based groups.
We are managing transition risks by, among other things, 
benchmarking energy, carbon, water, and waste performance 
at the asset level and prioritizing interventions at 
underperforming assets. We develop, operate, and maintain 
a large portfolio of buildings that are LEED, ENERGY STAR, 
and/or Fitwel certified. In 2024, 96% of our total in-service 
portfolio was certified under one or more of these 
frameworks. As a leader in green building, we will continue 
to make investments in building performance, energy 
efficiency, and decarbonization.
Through our climate action efforts, we believe we can play 
a leading role in advancing the transition to a low-carbon 
economy and are taking action to decarbonize operations. 
GHG sources include the generated electricity and steam at 
offsite generation facilities, the onsite combustion of fuels 
(e.g., natural gas), and emissions associated with other 
business activities, including business travel and new 
development. We continue to explore and implement creative 
and cost-effective measures that reduce GHG emissions 
from our operations. GHG mitigation efforts include energy 
efficiency measure implementation at existing in-service 
assets, high-performance new development, onsite 
renewable energy (e.g., solar PV systems), procurement of 
offsite renewable energy, public portfolio, and asset-level 
GHG short and long-term reduction targets, engagement 
of property engineers using real-time energy consumption 
data, sustainability education, and client engagement.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
Introduction
BXP committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations 
(CNO), or net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent emissions 
from operations, by 2025. As of December 31, 2024, 
we have officially achieved our 2025 CNO Goal. This ISO 
14068-1:2023-aligned Carbon-Neutral Management 
Report (CNMR) outlines the approach in achieving this goal. 
BXP’s CNMR is delivered and managed by BXP’s 
Sustainability Department and is reviewed by BXP’s 
Corporate Sustainability Steering  Committee.  
The boundary of BXP's 2025 CNO Goal includes direct 
and indirect Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions associated 
with BXP operations at occupied and actively managed 
office buildings as defined on Page 8. Scope 1 emissions 
are associated with the onsite combustion of fossil fuels 
for heating, hot water, and standby generators, in addition 
to fugitive emissions associated with the unintended 
release of gases or vapors from pressurized equipment 
such as HVAC and refrigeration systems. Scope 2 
emissions include all emissions associated with the offsite 
generation of electricity and steam consumed by the 
base building operations.
BXP’s larger carbon footprint includes indirect Scope 3 
emissions that occur from activities that are not owned 
or controlled by the Company, including Purchased Goods 
and Services, Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities Not 
Included in Scope 1 and Scope 2, Waste Generated in 
Operations, Business Travel, Employee Commuting, 
and Downstream Leased Assets. All client-related GHG 
emissions are allocated to Downstream Leased Assets, 
per the GHG Protocol.
GHG Emissions Metrics
BXP works closely with governments, policymakers, 
strategic partners, and our clients to decarbonize our 
operating activities with the long-term objective of 
achieving carbon-neutrality. 
As our business continues to grow, carbon reduction 
methods, targets, and the transparent disclosure of 
S&I metrics will remain a priority. We closely monitor GHG 
emissions and have provided detailed Scopes 1, 2, and 3 
emissions inventories in the accompanying table and 
graph. Per the GHG Protocol Measurement and Estimation 
Uncertainty of GHG Emissions Tool, the aggregated 
uncertainty of BXP's Scope 1 and 2 emissions is +/-5.6%.

GHG Emissions Reduction Targets & Methodologies
BXP has three existing GHG emissions goals: 
1.	2025 CNO Goal 
•	 Achieved as of December 31, 2024
2.	74x30 Science-Based Scope 1 + Scope 2 
Emissions Target
•	 BXP commits to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG 
emissions 73.57% per kgCO2e/m2 by 2030 from a 
2018 base year 
3.	58x30 Science-Based Scope 3: Purchased Goods 
and Services and Downstream Leased Assets 
Emissions Target
•	 BXP commits to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from 
Purchased Goods and Services and Downstream 
Leased Assets 58.14% per MtCO2e/m2 by 2030 
from a 2018 base year
The Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) Target Validation 
Team has classified BXP’s target ambitions as a science-based 
pathway and determined that they are in line with a 1.5°C 
trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the 
time of submission. At the time of BXP’s next target setting 
process, the targets will align with new climate science 
information as applicable. 
The baseline year for both science-based targets is 2018, 
which is the first year with verifiable Scopes 1, 2, and 3 
emissions data, and is a representative year for typical 
business activities at BXP. There is no baseline year for BXP’s 
2025 CNO Goal, as this goal reflects carbon-neutrality 
in the current state.
To calculate the baseline and current year emissions for 
Scope 1 (onsite combustion of fuels) and Scope 2 (electricity 
and steam), BXP multiplies activity data by appropriate 
emissions factors. Refer Pages 8-11 of BXP’s Environmental 
Management System, published annually in the Reports 
section of our Commitment webpage.

The SBTi Target 
Validation Team has 
classified BXP's target 
ambition and has 
determined that it is 
in line with a 1.5°C 
trajectory, currently 
the most ambitious 
designation available.
NET-ZERO DEVELOPMENT   |  BXP's first net-zero repositioning is located 
at 140 Kendrick Street - Building A in Needham, MA. The scope of the
renovation project included full electrification, building envelope improvements, 
advanced energy recovery systems, mechanical system modernization, 
and theaddition of on-site renewable energy generation. 140 Kendrick Street - 
Building A serves as precedence for the future of net-zero developments 
and repositioning projects.
MODERNIZING SYSTEMS & AMENITIES   |  Strong economically performing 
assets built in the 1960s, like 767 Fifth Avenue, require updating to maintain 
Class A sustainability and functionality expectations. BXP has advanced 
execution of a new chiller plant, amenity area, and building management 
system fault detection that will better serve clients, improve comfort 
control, and reduce operational energy costs and carbon emissions. These 
strategies have led to the building reducing its EUI by almost 50% and the 
ability to earn ENERGY STAR Certification for the first time.

1.	 ENERGY EFFICIENT OPERATIONS – approximately 1/3 of total 
carbon reductions by 2025 (below a 2018 base year) from energy 
conservation and efficient operations.
2.	RENEWABLE ENERGY – Advancement of onsite development of 
renewable energy systems and sourcing offsite renewable energy 
including green tariffs, unbundled renewable energy credits (RECs), 
and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to meet 100% of our electricity 
needs by 2025. 
•	BXP executed its first large-scale solar PPA in 2023 with Enel 
North America. In 2025, the Estonian Solar Project, a solar and 
storage project in Delta County, TX, officially came online. The 
solar project is expected to generate around 499 GWh of clean 
electricity each year and Enel North America is selling 21 MW of 
solar power from the project to BXP. This large-scale PPA plays 
a key role in advancing BXP's commitment to climate action and

Documentation Maintenance and Retention Procedure
As part of the annual S&I reporting process, BXP updates 
all GHG emissions documentation to reflect the activities 
in the most recent calendar year.
All previous GHG emissions documentation is stored 
locally on BXP servers as well as within previous S&I Reports 
published on BXP’s Commitment website.
Monitoring, Reporting, & Continuous Improvement
BXP continuously monitors GHG emissions and offsetting 
activities to ensure progress toward carbon-neutrality. 
Our annual S&I Report, published around Earth Day each year, 
continues to detail GHG emissions, reduction efforts, 
goal progress, and offsetting activities. 
Through this annual S&I reporting process, BXP regularly 
reviews our CNMR, evaluates the effectiveness of our 
annual target progress, and implements corrective actions 
where appropriate to ensure that targets are met.
Throughout the year, BXP’s Sustainability department 
meets with regional leadership, Engineering, and Property 
Management to identify GHG emissions reduction 
opportunities, and works with Development and Construction 
to design more efficient buildings.
BXP quantifies and monitors the social impacts of all 
new development projects related to Scope 3 Category 1: 
Purchased Goods and Services through an annual 
operational exercise. Refer to Page 48 for the 2024 metrics.
Additional Emissions Reduction Initiatives
BXP has achieved a 45x25 GHG Emissions Reduction 
Goal, a 39x24 Science-Based Scope 1+2 Emissions 
Target, a 14x25 Science-Based Scope 3: Capital Goods 
Emissions Target, a 32x25 Energy Use Reduction Goal, 
and as of December 31, 2024, our 2025 CNO Goal.
Additionally, as an active ULI Greenprint member, we 
have publicly committed to the ULI Greenprint Net-Zero 
Operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2050 Goal. 
In 2022, BXP signed on to the U.S. Department of Energy’s 
(DOE) Better Climate Challenge by committing to a 50% 
reduction in GHG emissions intensity and a 15% reduction 
in energy use intensity across our actively managed 
portfolio over ten years. BXP officially achieved the GHG 
emissions goal in 2023.
In 2023, BXP joined the NYSERDA Empire Building Challenge 
to decarbonize our 601 Lexington Avenue property. 
The project is estimated to reduce the building’s steam 
consumption by over 30% through the deployment of 
existing technology in a novel way, creating a thermal network 
that recovers and utilizes heat that would otherwise be 
rejected by the cooling towers. 
In 2024, BXP and an inaugural group of 16 cities, states, 
real estate firms, and cement and ready-mixed concrete 
producers, joined the Clean Concrete Pledge Initiative 
hosted by RMI, the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
and the National Ready-mixed Concrete Association, in 
collaboration with the White House. BXP pledged to purchase 
concrete with 15% lower emissions by December 2025.

Energy Management
Managing energy consumption and implementing energy 
conservation measures aligns with our objective to provide 
the greatest benefit to our stakeholders. We continually 
measure and manage the usage of electricity, gas, and 
steam using Energy Intelligence Software (EIS), EPA’s 
ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager®, and energy audits. Our 
Regional Managers and Heads of Property Management 
have annual performance goals with energy, GHG emissions, 
water, and waste targets. These goals are formulated at the 
asset level and roll up to regional and company-wide targets.
Energy Intelligence Software
Since 2011, BXP has strategically partnered with EnerNOC 
and Measurabl (formerly Hatch) to deploy real-time 
energy monitoring infrastructure, including 308 commodity 
meters at 107 sites. As active managers, BXP leverages 
interval data, automated alerts, conservation measure 
recommendations, and increased energy use awareness 
to optimize facility operations and control utility costs by 
adjusting Building Management System (BMS) programming, 
verifying nighttime shutdowns/setbacks, holiday scheduling, 
peak load shedding, optimizing equipment runtime, and 
executing strategic demand response events. 
Across the portfolio, 205 BXP employees log in monthly, 
while an average of 70 employees log in daily. Using interval 
data to optimize energy performance, BXP implemented 
more than 18 million kWh in automatically generated energy 
savings measures from 2017 through 2024, resulting in 
approximately $2.2 million in cumulative avoided annual 
energy expenses.

Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs)
We are committed to identifying and implementing ECMs 
and capital improvements that reduce energy use. 
Identified ECMs are reviewed and the projects that meet 
certain investment criteria are implemented. Since 2017, 
energy projects have cut annual use by over 21.6 million 
kWh, saving approximately $2.6 million per year. ECMs 
include lighting retrofits, HVAC upgrades, the addition 
of building management system (BMS) programming 
and controls, and any additional measures or capital 
improvements identified through our Comprehensive 
Retro-Commissioning (RCx) Program. 
Comprehensive Retro-Commissioning Program
With the passing of local energy and carbon regulations within 
most of our markets, BXP evaluated our total-in-service 
portfolio to project energy consumption, GHG emissions, 
and energy costs between 2025 and 2050 to determine 
exposure to upcoming regulatory risks. Based on the 
findings, BXP may mitigate such risks by reducing energy 
consumption and GHG emissions year-over-year. Out 
of this, our Comprehensive RCx Program was developed in 
2023 as a key strategy for optimizing building performance, 
which included studies to identify and correct inefficiencies 
in existing systems and quantify savings potential and 
implementation costs, focusing on major base building 
mechanical, plumbing, and lighting systems upgrades. 
As of December 31, 2024, 14 significant assets totaling 
13.2 MSF across our Boston, New York, and San Francisco 
regions have been included in the RCx Program.
Lighting Improvements
Implemented measures include the relamping and 
replacement of fixtures with high-efficiency LEDs and 
fluorescent lamps. Lighting system improvements also 
include the addition of occupancy and daylighting sensors 
and controls. Lighting improvements conserve resources, 
improve energy efficiency, and provide improved lighting 
quality that supports healthy and productive indoor 
environments for our clients.
HVAC Upgrades
Implemented measures include a variety of heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning improvements. Upgrades 
have been made to heating and cooling systems, including 
boiler retrofits, compressor replacements, air handling 
unit replacements, the addition of variable frequency drives, 
installation of heat exchangers, and improved filtration on 
cooling towers. HVAC equipment upgrades and replacement, 
central plant improvements, modernization and 
reconstruction projects are helping drive energy savings, 
and optimize occupant comfort, health, and wellness.
BMS Programming & Controls
Implemented measures include demand control ventilation, 
airflow stations and monitoring, occupancy sensors, 
and the addition of direct digital control points to building 
automation systems. Adjustment of ventilation rates to 
meet demand improves energy efficiency and air quality, 
particularly CO2 concentration. BMS fault detection 
pilots have been launched in Boston and New York.
Renewable Energy
In 2024, BXP generated 3,714 MWh renewably onsite at 
our actively managed offices. At specific sites, distributed 
generation technologies, like solar PV, can produce energy 
more cost-effectively than traditional technologies. We 
are pursuing renewable energy projects where these utility 
cost discounts are evident. We are actively researching 
and pursuing the adoption of alternative renewable energy 
technology, including battery storage, at our existing buildings 
and new developments. As of December 31, 2024, the 
total renewable energy consumed, both generated onsite 
and offsite, was 456,102 MWh.

We recognize the growing importance of water conservation, 
particularly where water scarcity has been an issue. Over 
the past nine years, BXP has upgraded plumbing fixtures 
across more than one-third of our in-service portfolio and 
has continued to execute LEED-certified new development 
projects that are designed to use 30% to 40% less 
water than code. Since 2008, BXP has reduced water 
use intensity (gallons/SF) by 49%. 
We use ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to monitor 
and benchmark water usage in buildings where we have 
access to water meter data. We prioritize the oldest, 
least efficient fixtures for improvement, and focus our 
efforts on some of our largest properties to ensure that we 
are maximizing our conservation efforts. Implemented 
improvements include smart controllers, low-flow sprinkler 
heads, rain sensors, cooling tower retrofits, and 
infrastructure improvements.

In partnership with our vendors and clients, BXP 
has implemented best waste management practices, 
including single-stream recycling, composting, 
and e-waste programs for solid waste in all our regions. 
As a result, 51% of office waste by weight is recycled, 
donated, or composted across our portfolio, which is 
a 42% increase since 2008. We also work closely with 
our vendors and clients to promote responsible waste 
management practices, including haul trip optimization 
and composting at cafés and restaurants. In 2016, we 
established a bold commitment to achieving a 65% 
diversion rate by 2020. Unfortunately, we fell short 
of that goal by a margin of approximately 10%. Diversion 
has become more challenging as the economics of 
recycling have become less favorable and waste haulers 
have become more discerning regarding contamination 
(recycling that contains non-recyclable materials). Going 
forward, we will perform more auditing of waste streams, 
engage clients to promote recycling, and will make 
efforts to introduce composting at more sites. In 2021, 
we reset our waste diversion target to 60% by 2025.
Single-Stream Recycling
We have worked across our portfolio with our clients 
and waste haulers to transition to single-stream recycling 
programs. Single stream simplifies recycling. Commingled 
materials are collected in one container and sorted offsite 
at a material recovery facility. The advantages of single-
stream recycling include increased client participation and 
potentially higher waste diversion rates.
Composting
Our integrated composting program diverted nearly 
1,700 tons of organic material from landfills in 2024. 
We work with our clients to ensure that they have signage 
and receptacles, and that our buildings have designated 
central compost bins with frequently scheduled pickup. 
Composting produces valuable nutrient-rich soil, avoids 
potentially significant methane emissions, and reduces 
the frequency of waste hauls required.

More than 82% of the square footage of our properties 
is in central business districts with ready access to public 
transportation. Within 0.25 miles of our buildings, our 
clients and the communities we operate in have access 
to thousands of alternatives to non-single occupancy 
vehicle (SOV) transportation, including bike spaces, bike-
sharing stations, bus stops, subway stations, commuter 
rail stations, car share spaces, hybrid spaces, vanpooling 
spaces, and EV charging stations.
BXP promotes the use of mass transit by our clients through 
on-site events, employee newsletters, and one-on-one 
meetings with client contacts. Our employees support 
alternative transportation programs by working with local 
transportation management authorities and supporting 
the use of carpooling. We encourage our employees to use 
alternatives to SOV by subsidizing the purchase of 
transit passes and enabling employees to fund many of 
their additional commuting expenses, such as vanpools 
and parking at public transportation stations, by using 
pre-tax dollars through our Commuter Benefits program.

BXP makes efforts to protect and enhance biodiversity 
and ecosystems during the development of new buildings 
and the operation of our existing buildings. Much of our 
new construction involves the redevelopment of existing 
sites, which conserves natural areas and habitats. In some 
cases, the redevelopment of sites involves the remediation 
of soil and water contamination caused by industrial 
activities by others. We design buildings to minimize light 
pollution which increases night sky access and reduces 
the consequences of development for wildlife and people. 
When we install site lighting, we typically model light 
levels and specify fixtures that minimize the trespass of 
light beyond the site boundary. We are also committed to 
supporting biodiversity by maintaining tree canopy cover 
and vegetated areas. BXP has several green roofs and 
has been a leader in urban beekeeping, with seven on-site 
apiaries. At our Bay Colony complex in Waltham, MA, 
BXP has installed bat houses to provide habitats for 
North American bats while also naturally reducing the 
number of insects on the waterfront property. We have 
also commissioned four urban farms in our Boston and 
Washington, DC markets that provide food for local charities. 
In 2024, BXP did not have any environmental violations.
Sustainable Sites
All of BXP's new development projects must target a minimum 
of LEED BD+C - Gold, which includes the achievement of 
the LEED Sustainable Sites (SS) prerequisites and applicable 
credits. The SS credit category was created to ensure 
that a projects natural environment would be valued and 
respected throughout every step of the building process, 
from planning to construction to management, and help 
avoid harming habitats, biodiversity, open space, and 
water bodies. At a minimum, all LEED BD+C projects must 
meet the SS Prerequisites: Construction Activity Pollution 
Prevention and Environmental Site Assessment, which 
provide safeguards for avoiding adverse impacts on the 
environment and society.
Wildlife Habitat Council Certification and 
BOMA Recognition
BXP’s 560-acre Carnegie Center site has earned the Wildlife 
Habitat Council’s Conservation Certification at the highest 
Gold level. Carnegie Center is the only multi-tenant office 
park in the Northeast with this distinction. As BXP’s first 
biodiversity certification, the project exhibits oustanding 
avian, mammal, pollinator, reptile, and amphibian habitat 
conservation efforts, in addition to conserving and monitoring 
several forest, grassland, and wetland locations throughout 
the site. In recognition of this effort, BXP has earned three 
awards from BOMA NJ which recognize our biodiversity

As developers and managers of buildings, and occupiers 
of many of those buildings, we are keenly aware of the 
influence of buildings on human health. In 2018, we announced 
a partnership with Fitwel, a leading healthy building 
certification system, to support healthy building design and 
operational practices across our portfolio and became a 
Fitwel Champion. Since then, we have certified 26.9 million 
SF under the Fitwel rating system, representing 49% of

Indoor Air Quality
Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) refers to the air quality within 
and around a building as it relates to the health and 
comfort of the occupants.
At BXP, we are committed to developing and maintaining 
sustainable properties while simultaneously providing 
healthy indoor environments for our clients, employees, 
contractors, and other visitors at our properties. As 
part of a smart-building strategy, our management and 
engineering teams use real-time energy consumption 
data to optimize facility operations, including IAQ, and 
to control energy consumption, GHG emissions, and 
utility costs. Increasingly, the energy we are using is from 
renewable sources.
SOCIAL IMPACT
Monitoring
BXP manages thermal comfort and air 
distribution by continuously monitoring 
space temperature set points and HVAC 
equipment performance using advanced 
building management systems. Rigorous 
air and water quality testing is conducted 
biannually at a minimum, with samples 
taken from throughout the building. 
Results are available upon request.
MERV filtration
All our properties are provided with 
filtration which is certified to at least 
a MERV-13 rating and to a MERV-14 
or MERV-15 rating.
HEPA Filters
Portable hospital grade 
HEPA filters are provided 
in our amenity conference 
rooms, cafes, and fitness 
centers.
Consumption
Our management and
engineering teams use 
real-time energy 
consumption data to
optimize facility operations 
and control utility costs.
Since 2008
We've reduced operational energy intensity by 39% 
and water intensity by 49%. Today, 96% of our 
actively managed office portfolio is LEED, ENERGY 
STAR, and/or Fitwel certified. 26.8 M SF of which is 
at the highest LEED Gold & Platinum levels.1
Fresh air rate
BXP has confirmed that all 
base-building systems can 
exceed the ventilation 
standard, ASHRAE 62.1. The 
median fresh air rate capacity 
at BXP office properties is 36 
CFM per person at 200 square 
feet per person (54 CFM at 
300 square feet per person).
Healthy building 
certification
In response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, BXP achieved Fitwel 
Viral Response Module enterprise 
certification and building-level 
certification at all actively managed 
office properties. The Viral Response 
Module was created to operationalize 
policies and practices to mitigate 
the spread of infectious disease in 
buildings.

Green Cleaning 
All six regions have formalized a Green Cleaning 
requirement with our cleaning vendors to minimize the 
impact of cleaning products on the environment. 
Aspects of this requirement include using Green Seal® 
certified cleaning products, High-Efficiency Particulate 
Air (HEPA) vacuums, dry cleaning for carpets, and 
restroom supply products made from recycled materials. 
Our Green Cleaning program benefits both the janitorial 
workers within our buildings and our clients because 
the cleaning methods and products used do not include 
toxic chemicals that can cause respiratory and 
dermatological problems. Indoor air quality has also 
improved because of the use of HEPA vacuums.
SOCIAL IMPACT
LIVING GREEN WALLS   |  As part of our healthy building and IAQ strategy, several BXP buildings include living green walls as an amenity in our lobbies. Living green walls offer many benefits, including purifying the air, increasing well-being,
reducing ambient noise and temperature, and offering a healing environment.

Our culture supports and nurtures our employees. 
Our employees are a significant distinguishing factor 
that sets BXP apart. As of December 31, 2024, we 
had 710 non-union employees (816 total employees, 
inclusive of union employees). Our operational and 
financial performance depends on their talents, energy, 
experience, and well-being. Our ability to attract 
and retain talented people depends on several factors, 
including work environment, career development and 
professional training, compensation and benefits, and 
the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. 
We have an established reputation for excellence and 
integrity; these core values are inherent in our culture 
and play a critical role in achieving our goals and overall 
success.
We believe that the success of our business is tied to 
the quality of our workforce. We strive to maintain a 
corporate environment without losing the entrepreneurial 
spirit with which we were founded more than 50 years 
ago. By providing a quality workplace and comprehensive 
benefit programs, we recognize the commitment of our 
employees to bring their talent, energy, and experience 
to us. Our continued success is attributable to our 
employees’ expertise and dedication.
We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys 
to monitor our employees’ satisfaction in different aspects 
of their employment, including company performance, 
leadership, communication, career development, and 
benefits offerings. Past employee responsiveness to the 
engagement surveys has been consistently high and 
the results help inform us on matters that our employees 
view as key contributors to a positive work experience. 
Based on the most recent Employee Engagement Survey 
conducted in 2022, with 96% responsiveness, the overall 
company-wide favorability result was a “favorable” rating. 
We intend to continue to periodically evaluate employee 
engagement as needed on a meaningful basis.
Another indicator of the success of our efforts in the 
workplace is the long tenure of our employees, 34% of 
whom have worked at BXP for ten or more years. 
The average tenure of our employees is approximately 
9.5 years and that of our officers is 18.4 years. In 2024, 
our voluntary workforce turnover rate was 10.8%.1 
No substantial portion of our work is performed by workers 
who are legally recognized as self-employed, or by 
individuals other than employees or supervised workers, 
including employees and supervised employees of 
contractors. We are not reporting on the work performed 
by third-party vendors and contractors in the construction 
and operation of our buildings.
As of the end of 2024, BXP had 808 full-time employees 
and 8 part-time employees, inclusive of intern employees 
and union employees. Excluding intern employees and 
union employees, BXP had 702 full-time employees and 
8 part-time employees. Approximately 13% of our total 
employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Our workforce provides a strategic business advantage, as 
it is one of our most valuable assets. We are committed 
to the quality, growth, and development of our people as 
part of our strategy to drive long-term value for our 
shareholders. We aim to ensure that all employees have 
the opportunity to make their maximum contribution

rules, or regulations. Our employment practices do 
not, and have not, included quotas or numerical targets 
based on any of these characteristics.
Belonging & Impact Council
BXP’s Belonging & Impact Council (the “Council”) is an 
executive-sponsored, employee-led, voluntary committee 
unified by BXP’s mission to promote a sense of belonging 
and transparency as part of our organization’s culture, 
while also providing a mechanism for positive impact in 
the communities in which we operate. The Council consists 
of more than 40 employees across our six regions, and 
each Council member contributes to the overall mission 
through leadership in one or more of the Council’s 
committees and/or four ERGs.
In 2024, the Council continued its focus on enhancing 
employees’ sense of belonging through educational 
opportunities for professional growth and cultural 
awareness, as well as positively impacting the community 
within BXP and the communities in which we operate. 
These efforts are important to the continued success and 
strength of our Company. Most notably in 2024, we:
•	 Strengthened Community
	› Strengthened the BXP community through fostering 
a foundation of trust among employees, which provided 
them with meaningful interactions and participation in 
numerous educational and professional development 
trainings.
•	 Provided Programs & Opportunities
	› Offered a wide breadth of programming and opportunities 
for involvement throughout the year that resonated with 
employees, including numerous volunteer opportunities 
in each of our regions.
•	 Aligned Resourced & Initiatives
	› With a focus on maintaining an impactful and sustainable 
program, refined our communication channels and 
program cadence, and aligned the Council’s initiatives 
with the resources available to support the Council’s 
mission, which included the issuance of a quarterly 
Belonging & Impact Newsletter.

All eligible employees receive an annual performance 
review. These evaluations are done in the same time 
frame as the review of annual incentive compensation. 
One of the general factors on the performance review 
requires the supervisor to address whether the employee 
has a fundamental understanding of our business and a 
demonstrated commitment to company policies.
We foster an environment of growth and internal promotion 
and strive for a best-in-class candidate experience for 
our internal applicants. Open positions are posted, and 
employees are highly encouraged to apply for promotion 
within the organization. In 2024, 6.3% of our employees 
were promoted to elevated roles within our organization. 
Of the employees promoted, 51% were women and 44% 
were ethnically diverse.1
Training & Education  
We invest significant resources in our employees’ personal 
and professional growth and development and provide

SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT REPORT
CONTENTS

To support the achievement of the Company’s 
overarching sustainability goals, the performance 
of each member of our executive team is assessed 
annually against pre-established corporate, operational, 
and management goals, and factors such as individual 
contributions to overall Company results are considered 
in our executive compensation program. Annually, 
at least one of these pre-established goals focuses on 
sustainability accomplishments across our portfolio.  
In 2024, these goals were formulated by the Chairman 
and CEO, President, and Senior Vice President, 
Sustainability. Sustainability targets and objectives are 
also communicated to senior management in weekly 
and monthly meetings, with progress monitored through 
weekly and monthly reports. With a wide range of 
department representatives in attendance, sustainability 
objectives are effectively communicated to the Board, 
senior management, and throughout the Company on 
a consistent basis.

SUSTAINABILITY & IMPACT REPORT
CONTENTS

For more than five decades, BXP and our employees have 
maintained the highest standards of integrity and ethics. 
We take pride in our traditions of responsibility and 
accountability. We also believe that transparent disclosure 
of our corporate governance policies is fundamentally 
important to maintaining our well-established reputation 
and preserving the trust of our investors. We believe this 
sets a “tone at the top” for good governance and includes 
the appropriate checks and balances that a formalized 
system of governance should have.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
BXP has established clear policies, administration, 
communication, training, and enforcement of a 
set of strict rules and regulations, found in our Code 
of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is publicly 
available on the Company’s website. The Code governs 
business decisions made and actions taken by our 
directors, officers, and employees and is an expression 
of the Company’s fundamental and core values, which 
include: (1) integrity and honesty in the Company’s and its 
employees’ dealings with clients, suppliers, co-venturers, 
competitors, shareholders, and the community; (2) 
respect for individuality and personal experience and 
background; and (3) support of the communities 
where the Company operates and its employee's work. 
Bribery and Corruption
BXP has a strong commitment to minimizing our 
exposure to bribery, corruption, and conflicts of interest. 
The Company requires strict adherence to the U.S. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 
2010, where applicable, and any similar anti-corruption 
and anti-bribery laws of the United States and other 
nations. Among other things, employees are prohibited 
from, directly or indirectly through a third party (1) 
offering, authorizing, promising, directing, or providing 
anything of value to any government official for the 
purpose of influencing that person to assist the Company 
in obtaining or retaining business or securing an 
improper business advantage, or (2) otherwise offering 
or giving anything to any person in connection with 
Company business that could be perceived as a bribe. 
Employee Business Conduct and Ethics Training 
and Whistleblower Mechanism
Across the Company, every employee receives online 
training regarding their obligations under the Code 
annually. Employees who deal specifically with the 
government also receive in-person training regarding 
the requirements of the Code as it relates to the 
Federal Government annually. Additionally, all employees 
must certify in writing at the time they are hired that 
they will abide by the Code, and each employee must 
provide a re-certification every time they are trained. 
BXP requires employees to report any suspected 
violations of the Code, including using the EthicsPointTM 
Reporting System. Through EthicsPoint, any employee 
can anonymously report any suspected or observed 
violations of the Code 24 hours per day, 365 days 
per year, either online or via telephone. In addition, BXP 
includes a provision highlighting the requirements 
of our Code in vendor contracts, including how to file 
a complaint on our hotline if they become aware of 
any inappropriate activity by an employee. We remain 
committed to adhering to these policies and principles 
and are confident that our employees will continue to 
conduct themselves in a manner consistent with 
these policies and ideals. 
Political Spending
The Company has established a Policy on Company 
Political Spending, publicly posted on our website, which 
requires the prior approval of our Chief Legal Officer, 
in consultation with our Chairman and CEO and President, 
of any political contributions made by the Company. 
The policy is available under the "Governance" section 
of our website. In the interest of transparent reporting 
of political contributions of the Company, beginning in 
2025, BXP biannually publishes on our website the 
names of all recipients of Company political spending and 
the amounts contributed in accordance with our policy.

BXP continually invests in maintaining the security and 
integrity of our IT networks, systems, and applications to 
mitigate the risk of a security compromise or breach 
on our corporate operations and/or our buildings. Like 
all organizations, we face the risks associated with 
security breaches, whether through cyber attacks or cyber 
intrusions over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, 
attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or 
persons with access to systems inside our organization, 
and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and 
related systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, 
particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, has 
increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of 
attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world 
have increased. BXP’s IT networks and related systems 
are essential to the operation of our business, ability to 
perform day-to-day operations, and management of 
our building systems. To this end, BXP maintains a robust 
set of security protections, expertise, and programs 
centered on mitigating risk across our entire enterprise 
ranging from awareness training to advanced firewalls 
to layered monitoring programs.
The Audit Committee of BXP’s Board of Directors oversees 
our risk management processes related to cybersecurity. 
It meets no less frequently than annually with our IT 
personnel and senior management to discuss recent trends 
in cyber risks and our strategy to defend our IT networks, 
business systems, and information against cyber attacks 
and intrusions. Under the oversight of the Audit Committee, 
we established our overall cybersecurity program and its 
standards by reference to the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology (“NIST”) Cyber Security Framework. The 
program also responds to changing local, state, and 
national regulations including the disclosure rules adopted 
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023.

NIST FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT  |  BXP’s Cybersecurity program is aligned 
with NIST, which helps businesses of all sizes better understand, manage, 
and reduce their cybersecurity risk and protect their networks and data. 
The five elements of the NIST Framework include identifying vital systems, 
protecting those systems, detecting cyber threats, responding to such threats, 
and the ability to recover via well-established business continuity plans.

ASSURANCE STATEMENT
Independent Assurance Statement
Boston Properties, Inc (“BXP”) commissioned DNV Business Assurance USA, Inc. (“DNV”, “we”, or “us”) to undertake 
independent assurance of the 2024 BXP Sustainability and Impact Report (the “Report”) and to carry out an independent 
verification for selected performance indicators from January 1st, 2024 to December 31st, 2024.
Our Opinion: On the basis of the work undertaken, nothing came to our attention to suggest that
the Report does not properly describe BXP’s adherence to the Principles described below. In
terms of reliability of the performance data, nothing came to our attention to suggest that these 
data have not been properly collated from information reported at operational level, nor that the
assumptions used were inappropriate. In our opinion, the Report provides sufficient information 
for readers to understand the company’s management approach to its most material issues and
impacts.
Without affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations:
Stakeholder Inclusiveness
The participation of stakeholdersin developing and achieving an
accountable and strategic responseto sustainability.
BXPremains committed to engaging a rangeof internal and external
stakeholders, including clients, investors, and employees. This
commitment is evident in the company’s ongoing efforts to expand
investor engagement on critical sustainability and impact (S&I)‐related
issues, as well as its active participation in industry associations, which
enhances its understanding of best practices and emerging S&I trends.
Building on these engagements, BXPcontinues to leverage stakeholder
feedback to refine its sustainability strategy, for example, by
emphasizing green leasing and improving the portfolio’s sustainable
performance to drive positive outcomes. In 2024,BXP’sBelonging &
Impact Council remains actively engaged with employees, fostering a
supportive and inclusive workplace. Additionally, BXP regularly
assessesemployee engagement, demonstrating its commitment to
understanding key factors thatcontribute to a positive work
experience. Our review confirms that stakeholder priorities and
perspectives have significantly influenced decision‐making across the
business and are reflected throughout this report.
Materiality
The processfor determining the issuesthat aremostrelevant to an
organiation and its stakeholders.
In our opinion, the report addressesthe most material topics for the
company and its stakeholders.In 2024,BXPdetermined thata revision
to its materiality matrix wasnot needed and continued to incorporate
the results of 2022materiality assessment to confirm S&I‐related
performance indicators, prioritize resource allocation, and determine
the content of the report. BXPcontinues to refine its process for
defining materiality by evaluating the S&I interests, topics, and
indicators raised by stakeholders and the top issues, including the
economic performance, ethical business conduct, carbon emissions,
and customer satisfaction,remain amongst the most material for 2024.
The assessment process, including an overview of stakeholder groups
engaged in the materiality refresh processof 2019and 2022,is
described in the report.
Responsiveness
Timely and relevant reaction to material sustainability topics and
their relatedimpacts.
Stakeholder concerns and priorities play a pivotal role in shaping
decision‐making across BXP’sbusiness operations. DNV has observed
thatBXP is actively gathering information and closely monitoring the
evolving regulatory landscapearound critical issues in the real estate
sector, such asclimate risks. In 2024,BXPengaged First Street to assess
forward‐looking physical climate risk acrossits entire portfolio and the
analysis identified no material findings. BXPis committed to using
these results to inform its climate resilience strategyand guide future
investment decisions. The company demonstrates a strong
commitment to continuous improvement, working to ensure a
proactive and transparentapproach in addressing key stakeholder
concerns.
Completeness
Howmuch of all the information that has beenidentified as material
to the organization and itsstakeholdersis reported.
The report is comprehensive and provides insight into how BXP
continues to manage and monitor its most material issues throughout
the reporting period. Additionally, the report highlights BXP’s
Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee and Company‐Wide
Sustainable Operations Committee, outlining the company’s
governance approach to sustainability. Based on our assessment, we
found no evidence thatBXPhasoverlooked or failed to report on any
of its material issues.
Neutrality
The disclosure of a balanced account of performancein a neutral
tone.
BXP’sreport provides an unbiased and comprehensive accountof its
S&I performance. The company presents both achievements, future
targets, and areasneeding continuous improvement with equal
transparency,avoiding overly positive or negative language. This
balanced approachensures stakeholders receive an accurate and fair
representation of BXP’sS&I initiatives and outcomes.
Statement No.DNV‐2025‐ASR‐769045

ASSURANCE STATEMENT
Sustainability Context
The presentation of the organization’s performancein the wider
contextof sustainability.
BXPremains up to datein its disclosure of performanceon key issues
relevant to thereal estatesector. In 2024,the company continues to
align with global frameworks, including the TaskForce on Climate‐
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals(SDGs), to guide its decision‐making processes.
Notably, the company has further strengthened its reporting and
commitment to achieving carbon‐neutral operations by disclosing its
Carbon‐NeutralManagement Report, aligned with ISO 14068. DNV
also confirms that the Science‐based Targets initiative (SBTi) Target
Validation Team hasclassified BXP’stargetambitions asa science‐
basedpathwayand determined thatthey arein line with a 1.5°C
trajectory,the most ambitious designation available at the time of
submission.
Given BXP’ssector and operational footprint, we consider the
disclosures within the report to be appropriateand reflective of its
sustainability context.
Reliability and quality
The accuracy and comparability of information presentedin the
Report, aswell asthequality of underlying data management
systems.
Overall, we haveconfidence in the processesin place to ensure
reasonable accuracyfor the information presented in the Report and
datamanagement systems. Goalsand performance dataare
presented objectively, with a clear, comprehensive, and balanced
representation of 2024performance.
Our review of the specified datapresented in the report resulted in
minimal technical errors being identified basedon our sampling. These
errorshave been correctedfor the final report.
Basedon the processes and procedures conducted with a limited
assurance,there is no evidence thatthe GHGassertions and
environmental footprint dataarenotmaterially correct, arenota fair
representation of GHGand environmental dataand thatinformation
hasnot been prepared with the calculation method referenced.
Scope and Approach
We performed our work using DNV’s assurance methodology VeriSustainTM, which is
based on our professional experience, international assurance best practice including
the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (“ISAE 3000”), and the
Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.
DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality
control, which are based on the principles enclosed with the ISO IEC 17029:2019 ‐
Conformity Assessment – General principles and requirements for validation and
verification bodies, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory
requirements.
We evaluated the Report for adherence to the VeriSustainTM Principles (the
“Principles”) of stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, sustainability context,
completeness, and reliability. We evaluated the performance data using the
reliability principle together with BXP’S data protocols for how the data are
measured, recorded and reported. The reporting criteria against which the GHG
verification was conducted is the World Business Council for Sustainable
Development (WBSCD)/World Resources Institute (WRI) Greenhouse Gas –
Corporate Accounting Standard.
With the exception of Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the boundary of our work
is restricted to occupied (defined as no more than 50 percent vacancy) and actively
managed multi‐tenant office buildings in BXP’s portfolio where the company has
operational control. The boundary includes all eligible buildings that meet these
criteria that have remained within the company ownership for full calendar 2024.
This includes 75 buildings which account for 73 percent of the total in‐service
portfolio by area.
We understand that the reported financial data and information are based on data
from BXP’s 10‐K, which is subject to a separate independent audit process. The
review of financial data taken from the 10‐K is not within the scope of our work. In
addition, claims and assertions related to the company’s Green Bond and use of
proceeds are outside the scope this assurance.
BXP has sole responsibility for the
preparation of the Report. In
performing our assurance work, our
responsibility is to the management of
BXP; however, our statement
represents our independent opinion
and is intended to inform all
stakeholders. DNV was not involved in
the preparation of any statements or
data included in the Report except for
this Assurance Statement. We have no
other contract with BXP. This is our
sixth year providing assurance for
BXP’s Report. In addition, DNV
conducted limited level assurance over
BXP’s carbon neutrality claim. Our
opinion can be found in Statement No.

ASSURANCE STATEMENT
Independent Limited Assurance Statement
to the Management of BXP, Inc.
BXP, Inc. (BXP) commissioned DNV Business Assurance USA, Inc (“DNV”, “us” or “we”) to conduct a limited assurance engagement over 
the carbon neutrality claim related to Carbon‐Neutral Operations (the “Claim”) in the Carbon‐Neutral Management Report (the 
“Report”)1 for BXP (NYSE: BXP) for the reporting period starting from January 1, 2024, and ending on December 31, 2024.
Scope of work
The scope and boundary of our work is restricted to assessing that the calculation approach used by BXP to achieve Carbon‐Neutral 
Operations with reference to ISO 14068‐1:2023, Climate change management — Transition to net zero —Part 1: Carbon neutrality 
standard (the “Criteria”). We verified the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions against the requirement provided by WRI & WBCSD 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard Revised edition. 
The scope of the Carbon‐Neutral Operations claim is related to Direct (Scope 1) and Indirect (Scope 2) emissions for the organization of 
BXP, Inc. (NYSE: BXP) based in United States of America. This is DNV’s first year conducting assurance of BXP’s Carbon‐Neutral 
Operations claim. In addition, this is our sixth year providing assurance for BXP’s Sustainability and Impact Report. Our opinion can be 
found in Statement No. DNV‐2025‐ASR‐769045, dated April 17, 2025. 
We have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published outside of the
Report and/or on BXP’s websites for the current reporting period or for previous periods related to carbon neutrality claims against the 
Criteria. Our work also excluded assessing the reliability of the inputs of the carbon footprint model. 
Basis of Our Conclusion
We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Report and the Claim. Our 
work included, but was not restricted to: 
For the 2024 Report:

Interviews with top management at BXP to confirm:
•
the commitment to BXP’s Carbon‐Neutral Operations for the organization, the description, and the boundary
•
who is responsible for the delivery of the carbon neutrality management plan

Review of the methodology used for the carbon footprint quantification

Review of the type of GHG emission reductions in absolute emissions

Evaluation of activities to achieve GHG emission reductions
For the 2024 Claim

Evaluation of the boundary of the Claim, defined by BXP as “Carbon‐Neutral Operations” comprised of Direct (Scope 1) and
Indirect (Scope 2) emissions, including offsetting of the residual emissions

Evaluation of the organization’s approach to addressing 2024 residual emissions through the use of carbon offsets, Renewable
Energy Certificates (RECs) or equivalent energy attribute instruments

Assessment of the above instruments against the quality and eligibility criteria set out in the Criteria, reviewed the number of
carbon credits used by registry and type, including their unique serial number

Determination of whether the Claim is substantiated by the evidence provided, and aligned with the principles of transparency, 
consistency, relevance, and accuracy set out in the Criteria.
Scope Limitations

The review of the Report and the Claim is limited to the 2024 reported Carbon‐Neutral Operations only and excludes forward‐
looking information related to BXP’s carbon neutrality objectives

The Claim considers Direct (Scope 1) and Indirect (Scope 2) emissions only, with other Indirect (Scope 3) emissions excluded

While these limitations do not impact our opinion on the 2024 Direct (Scope 1) and Indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions claim
(Carbon‐Neutral Operations claim), they represent deviations related to carbon neutrality management over time as per ISO
14068‐1:2023
Our Conclusion: Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Claim is not fairly stated and has 
not been prepared, in all material respects, with reference to the Criteria.
This conclusion relates only to the Claim, and is to be read in the context of this Independent Limited 
Assurance Statement, in particular the scope limitations and the inherent limitations explained below. 
Inherent Limitations
All assurance engagements are subject to inherent limitations as selective testing (sampling) may not detect errors, fraud or other 
irregularities. Non‐financial data may be subject to greater inherent uncertainty than financial data, given the nature and methods 
used for calculating, estimating and determining such data. The selection of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques may 
result in different quantifications between different entities.
Our assurance relies on the premise that the data and information provided to us by BXP have been provided in good faith. DNV 
expressly disclaims any liability or co‐responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Independent
Limited Assurance Statement.

ASSURANCE STATEMENT
Standard and Level of Assurance 
We performed a limited assurance engagement using DNV’s 
assurance protocol VeriSustainTM, which is based on international 
assurance best practice including the International Standard on 
Assurance Engagements 3000 revised (“ISAE 3000”) and the Global 
Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.
This standard requires that we comply with ethical requirements and 
plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited 
assurance.
DNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies 
for quality control, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17029:2019 ‐
Conformity Assessment Requirements for bodies providing audit and 
certification of management systems, and accordingly maintains a 
comprehensive system of quality control including documented 
policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical 
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements.
We are providing a ‘limited level’ of assurance, and we planned and 
performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary 
to provide a basis for our assurance opinion, so that the risk of this 
conclusion being in error is reduced, but not reduced completely. The 
procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in 
nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable 
assurance engagement. A ‘reasonable level’ of assurance would have 
required additional work at headquarters and site levels to gain 
further evidence to support the basis of our assurance opinion.
Responsibilities of  BXP Management and DNV
The Management of BXP have sole responsibility for:

Preparing and presenting the Report in accordance 
with the Criteria;

Designing, implementing and maintaining effective 
internal controls over the information and data, 
resulting in the preparation of the Report that is free 
from material misstatements;

Measuring and reporting the Report’s data based on 
the established Criteria; and

Contents and statements contained within the Report.
Our responsibility is to plan and perform our work to 
obtain limited assurance about whether the Claim has 
been prepared in accordance with the Criteria and to 
report to BXP in the form of an Independent Limited 
Assurance Statement, based on the work performed and
the evidence obtained. We have not been responsible for 
the preparation of the Report.
