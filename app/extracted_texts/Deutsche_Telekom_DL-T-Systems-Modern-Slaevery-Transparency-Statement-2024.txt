Introduction 
 
This document is published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, 
Part 6, Transparency in Supply Chains etc. and constitutes T-Systems 
Limited’s (hereinafter “T-Systems”) slavery and human trafficking statement 
for the year ending 31 December 2023  
 
T-Systems in no way accepts modern slavery or human trafficking in our 
organisation or in our supply chain. 
 
T-Systems’ Code of Conduct and Code of Human Rights and Social Principles 
sets out the standards expected of all staff, and opposes illegal and inhumane 
behaviour practices, including slavery, servitude, forced or compulsory labour 
and human trafficking. The Code of Conduct and Code of Human Rights and 
Social Principles makes clear that we support universal human rights, including 
equal employment, freedom of speech and of association, and cultural, 
economic, and social well-being.  
 
 
T-Systems management openly discusses the topic of Modern Slavery with its 
employees and emphasises the importance of adherence to the code. It is also 
ensuring transparency within its Suppliers and ensures that they sign up to 
relevant contractual clauses and our Code of Conduct. Whilst the reputation of 
T-Systems and the trust and confidence of our customers and stakeholders is 
central to the continued success of our business, we are committed to ensuring 
that the operation of this business is not founded on any elements of Modern 
Slavery.  
 
Section 54(2) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 governs the activities of T-
Systems.

Organisational Structure 
 
T-Systems Limited, a private limited company incorporated in England and 
Wales, is a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Systems International GmbH; both 
are members of the Deutsche Telekom AG (“DTAG”) Group of companies.  
 
As a subsidiary of DTAG Group, T-Systems is a provider of IT services to 
customers both in the locally and internationally. The services delivered are 
provided entirely locally or with the collaboration of other DTAG Group 
companies and/or with the use of our external partner eco-system.  
 
T-Systems does not participate in the manufacture of any goods.  
 
T-Systems’ Board of Directors takes its commitments to preventing modern 
slavery and protecting human rights very seriously and has responsibility for 
producing this statement.  
 
Compliance, Finance, HR, Legal, Marketing, and Procurement functions, as 
well as all senior management, have responsibility for ensuring T-Systems 
meet these standards, that our workers are protected, and that risks are 
identified and appropriately mitigated. All staff throughout our organisation 
have responsibility for adhering to the standards set out in this statement. 
 
 
Policies in Relation to Slavery 
 
T-Systems has published a UK Modern Slavery Act policy.  
 
All members of the DTAG Group operate in accordance with the DTAG Code 
of Conduct, DTAG Code of Human Rights and Social Principles and the DTAG 
Supplier Code of Conduct. These taken together reflect the groups commitment 
to behaving ethically and conducting itself with integrity in all our business 
relationships. We have a zero-tolerance approach to abuse of human rights 
and to ensuring that measures are in place to recognise and prevent Modern 
Slavery.  
 
DTAG operate a whistle-blowing policy, “Tell Me”, which encourages 
employees to confidentially report any wrongdoing in relation to Modern 
Slavery and all reports are fully investigated and appropriate remedial actions 
taken where necessary.

Due Diligence Processes 
 
As part of the due diligence processes for on-boarding suppliers, a review of 
the controls connected to slavery and human trafficking undertaken by the 
supplier will always be conducted. T-Systems will not support or deal with any 
business knowingly involved in slavery or human trafficking. 
 
T-Systems’ Vendor Service Agreement has a Modern Slavery Act clause 
which suppliers must agree to when they sign up to T-Systems’ contracts. 
Any supplier who signed a contract has confirmed their acceptance of the 
clause. 
 
Within the T-Systems’ Request for Proposal (RFP), a prospective supplier 
must confirm that they are acting in accordance with the requirements of the 
Modern Slavery Act to be able to continue in the tender process. 
 
 
Ongoing Risk Assessment  
 
All providers of goods or services to T-Systems are required to provide a 
copy of their own slavery and human trafficking statement and these are kept 
on file. During scheduled periodic reviews of supplier performance checks are 
carried out to ensure the full supply-chain is maintaining compliance with their 
own policies and current legislation. 
 
T-Systems subscribes to the National Living Wage. T-Systems actively 
contracts for personnel support on this basis.

Training on Slavery and Human Trafficking 
 
When the Modern Slavery Act 2015 was first implemented all current T-
Systems staff and contractors were required to undertake a bespoke slavery 
and human trafficking training module within the DTAG on-line training facility 
“HR Suite”. The requirements of the Modern Slavery Act and developments 
thereto were again presented to staff in 2023 at a ‘Campfire’ communication 
session. Refresher training, this time in video form, was also made available in 
2023 to each member of staff and it is known that 74% of employees have 
undertaken this training.  
 
 
 
 
Steps to Measure Effectiveness 
 
Periodic reminders of the Company commitment to Modern Slavery are sent 
out on e-mail to employees and published on our Intranet.  
 
 
Continuous Diligence 
 
T-Systems continues to operate a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery 
and human trafficking in our organisation and in our supply chain, and commits 
to: 
 
1. Identify, assessing and monitoring potential risk areas in our own 
business and our supply chains and taking appropriate action.  
2. Ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of slavery and human 
trafficking by providing advice and training to our employees. 
 
In 2024, T-Systems plans to rerun its Modern Slavery training with particular 
reference to the activities to be undertaken by the House of Lords Select 
Committee, on strengthening the Modern Slavery Act.
