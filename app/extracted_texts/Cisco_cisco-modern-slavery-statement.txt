Cisco Statement on the Prevention of Modern 
Slavery and Human Trafficking 
At Cisco Systems, Inc. (and together with its subsidiaries, “Cisco”), labor and human rights are a top priority. We are committed to treating 
everyone who works at or with Cisco with dignity and respect. We explicitly prohibit human trafficking, child labor, and the use of involuntary 
labor within our supply base, and this extends to forced, bonded, or indentured labor, involuntary or exploitative prison labor, and other forms of 
modern slavery. 
We are committed to working with industry partners and our supply chain to drive high standards in the industry. By collaborating with other 
thought leaders across the industry, we can increase our positive impact.  
This statement is designed to meet Cisco’s reporting obligations under the Canadian Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply 
Chains Act1, the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth)2, the UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015, Articles 964j-l of the Swiss Code of Obligation and 
the Ordinance on Due Diligence and Transparency in relation to Minerals and Metals from Conflict-Affected Areas and Child Labor (DDTrO) 
(2021)3, and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Cisco provides this statement for itself and on behalf of certain directly and 
indirectly controlled foreign subsidiaries that are directly covered by a disclosure obligation in their respective jurisdictions. Currently this includes 
Cisco Systems Canada Co. and Accedian Networks Inc. pursuant to the Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act; Cisco 
International Limited, AppDynamics UK Ltd., AppDynamics International Ltd., IMImobile Europe Limited and IMImobile Limited pursuant to the UK 
Modern Slavery Act of 2015; Cisco Systems GmbH and Cisco Systems International Sarl pursuant to the DDTrO, and Cisco Systems Australia Pty 
Limited which is the only reporting entity for the purpose of the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth). Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries 
share the same core business operations and supply chains, policies prohibiting modern slavery, and supporting processes further described in 
this statement. The below statement covers Cisco’s fiscal year ended July 27, 2024 (“FY 2024”). During FY 2024, Cisco completed its acquisition of 
Splunk Inc. Cisco is currently working to integrate Splunk Inc. into its company-wide anti-modern slavery program, and this work will continue in 
FY 2025.4 During FY 2024, Cisco also completed its acquisition of Accedian Networks Inc. and is working to fully integrate Accedian's supply chain 
in FY 2025.  
This statement communicates Cisco's policies and practices to respect human rights, how we identify and address potential impacts, and how we 
mitigate risks. Cisco upholds and respects human rights as contained in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); and 
the eight Core Labour Conventions developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO), including Conventions No.29 and No.105 on the 
elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour. Cisco’s approach is informed by the documents identified above, grounded in the 
framework set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and 
Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct (OECD Guidance), and includes ongoing engagement of potentially 
impacted stakeholders or their legitimate representatives.

Cisco’s Policies 
Cisco's policies and approach to preventing involuntary labor and human trafficking have been developed based on international labor and human 
rights standards, as well as best practices across the global business community. These policies apply to the whole Cisco group and all local 
subsidiaries, including Cisco Switzerland, Cisco Australia,7 and Cisco Canada, are expected to adhere to them. These policies establish our baseline 
expectations as well as communicate our values and help promote trust and collaboration as a key underpinning of our many business and 
stakeholder relationships. Cisco’s specific policies include: 
• 
Global Human Rights Policy: Our commitment to upholding and respecting human rights is stated in our Global Human Rights Policy. Our 
approach is governed by international human rights frameworks, including the UDHR, ICCPR, ICESCR, the ILO core labor standards, and 
is aligned to the UNGPs. A dedicated Business and Human Rights (BHR) team is responsible for implementation of this policy, which we 
review on a regular basis. Our Human Rights Advisory Committee (HRAC) advises the BHR team on issues related to Cisco’s support of 
and respect for human rights. Our HRAC includes leadership from functions across the business.  
• 
Code of Business Conduct (COBC): Our COBC is a crucial part of our company culture that provides employees with a clear 
understanding of our core values and the high standards for ethical conduct by which we conduct our business, including respect for 
human rights. 
• 
Supplier Code of Conduct: Cisco has adopted the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct as its own (the Supplier Code of 
Conduct). The Supplier Code of Conduct (available in more than 20 languages) prohibits workers from paying fees for their employment 
at any time, as outlined in the Definition of Fees. The Supplier Code of Conduct defines Cisco’s requirement for suppliers to implement 
 
5 For the purpose of the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth), Cisco Australia conducts business for Cisco in Australia as a subsidiary. It has a number of direct and indirect subsidiaries 
(see footnote number 7). Cisco Australia’s principal activities are to market, distribute and sell ICT products and services including networking, collaboration, security, wireless and mobility, 
data center, IoT, video, analytics, and products, services and solutions in Australia. For the purpose of the Canadian Fighting Against Forced Labour and Child Labour in Supply Chains Act,

management systems to protect workers’ rights and prohibit forced labor. The Supplier Code of Conduct prohibits the use of forced, 
bonded (including debt bondage) and indentured labor, involuntary or exploitative prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons, and 
prohibits unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement as well as child labor. Cisco suppliers are required to 
acknowledge the Supplier Code of Conduct as part of doing business with Cisco. Furthermore, the Supplier Code of Conduct is a 
foundational element of our Supplier Ethics Policy (outlined below). Our Supplier Code of Conduct aligns with the ILO Indicators of 
Forced Labour so that when supplier sites are assessed for Supplier Code of Conduct conformance, indicators such as deception during 
recruitment, identity document retention, wage withholding, debt bondage, abusive conditions, and restriction of movement are 
examined. 
• 
Respecting the Rights of Vulnerable Groups Policy: This policy sets forth principles for protecting the most vulnerable individuals in our 
supply chain and guiding our suppliers and partners to do the same. The policy includes specific expectations for prohibiting all forms of 
forced labor and respecting the rights of vulnerable groups, including children, and those most vulnerable to forced labor risks. 
• 
Supplier Ethics Policy: Our Supplier Ethics Policy requires Cisco suppliers and their employees to conduct themselves with the highest 
standards of honesty, fairness, and personal integrity. Suppliers must ensure that their employees, subcontractors, agents, and third 
parties assigned to provide services or products to Cisco act consistently with this policy. This policy also is incorporated within standard 
terms and conditions for Cisco’s global affiliates that supply Cisco’s products and Cisco’s indirect procurement suppliers. Furthermore, 
suppliers acknowledge and commit to the Supplier Code of Conduct when they agree to the Supplier Ethics Policy.  
• 
Juvenile Labor Policy and Expectations: Our Juvenile Labor Policy and Expectations require suppliers to uphold the human rights of 
children, juvenile or young workers, students, interns, and apprentices. Our policy and due diligence are informed by international 
standards such as the ILO-IOE Child Labor Guidance for Business. Pursuant to the policy, Cisco suppliers must have procedures that 
facilitate the immediate remediation and protection of the well-being of children, in case they are found working onsite. Cisco’s priority 
is to help ensure that any solution must improve the child’s situation and that the child is not made more vulnerable to abuse. Cisco 
further commits to uphold the eight ILO Core Conventions, including Conventions 132 and 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
(1999) and Convention 138 on Minimum Age (1973). 
• 
Responsible Minerals Policy: Cisco’s Responsible Mineral Policy aligns with our long-standing commitment to uphold and respect human 
rights for all people, including those who work in our supply chain. Our goal is to work collaboratively through the supply chain to source 
minerals consistent with our values around human rights. Pursuant to this policy, Cisco commits to conduct due diligence to identify and 
mitigate risks in our supply chain for relevant minerals following the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of 
Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs), including all risks identified in Annex II of the OECD guidance which 
include forced labor and the worst forms of child labor. Cisco requires our suppliers to maintain policies and programs to do the same. 
 
Risks of Modern Slavery, Human Trafficking, and Child Labor 
Cisco continually works to identify and mitigate potential human rights risks linked to our business. We conduct human rights due diligence and 
human rights impact assessments in our own operations and across our value chain to identify, prevent, mitigate, and work to address human 
rights risks. Based on our ongoing human rights due diligence, we have determined that the risk of modern slavery, human trafficking, and child 
labor occurring is likely to be highest in our supply chain. These risks are likely to be lower in our own operations.  
Due to the extensive nature of our materials supply chain network, business is conducted with suppliers in a variety of global contexts, including in 
countries where local law may not exist or may not be enforced effectively to protect populations vulnerable to forced labor, child labor or human 
trafficking risks. Due to constraints in local labor markets, suppliers may deploy workforce strategies to recruit foreign or domestic migrant 
workers using labor recruitment agencies. As a result, workers could potentially be subject to conditions that may contribute to forced labor such 
as debt bondage, by paying excessive recruitment fees; passport withholding; a lack of transparency of terms and conditions in their contracts if 
those contracts are not in their own language or are not fully explained before they commence employment; and lack of legal protections in the 
countries where they work or from where they migrated. While child labor is less likely in the electronics sector than other sectors, suppliers may 
recruit young workers aged 15-18, students, interns, and apprentices to mitigate labor shortages. In addition, there are potential risks that these 
workers could be conducting hazardous work that could harm their long-term health and well-being.

Our supply chain network also includes a complex mineral supply chain. Like many companies in the electronics industry, our products contain 
various minerals necessary for functionality. Cisco does not directly procure minerals from mines, or from the smelters or refiners that process 
them. However, some mine operations can pose serious human rights risks, including forced labor, child labor and other risks for the workers and 
communities at the beginning of the electronics supply chain.  
In addition to outlining Cisco’s expectations for suppliers to uphold human rights through policy, Cisco undertakes a variety of actions to address 
and mitigate these risks.  
Cisco’s Actions 
Cisco takes multiple approaches to help protect workers from forced labor, child labor, slavery and human trafficking in our own business and 
materials supply chain. We publish detailed information about our program on our Purpose Reporting Hub, which is updated annually. We take 
the following activities with our direct material suppliers: 
● Verification: We evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery through conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct and 
using a risk-based approach. When new suppliers are onboarded, Cisco assesses for modern slavery and child labor risks, which includes 
an assessment of whether the supplier employs vulnerable workers (for example, foreign migrant workers and young workers). If risks are 
identified, we follow up to determine if impacts need to be addressed prior to scaling business with the supplier. 
For existing suppliers and supplier entities that are integrated through acquisitions, Cisco follows its standard programs and due diligence 
processes, as follows: Cisco conducts an annual risk assessment by evaluating the supply base on social and environmental risk factors. 
This evaluation includes indicators for forced labor, child labor, and human trafficking risks in addition to the potential presence of 
vulnerable worker groups. The outputs of the risk assessment identify which suppliers we will ask to demonstrate their conformance to 
the Code, using RBA’s assessment tools, such as the Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), Validated Audit Process (VAP), or its 
equivalent. Cisco assesses the effectiveness of the risk assessment process and continuously works to improve the process, including an 
annual review to maintain relevance to our operations with updated risk indicators, newly available data, and accounts for lessons learned 
over the past year. We also regularly convene or attend teleconferences, trainings, webinars, and other meetings so that we may better 
understand and monitor risks associated with labor recruitment practices.  
● Audits: We conduct third-party supplier audits using the VAP, or its equivalent, or review audit reports through the RBA’s audit sharing 
system and conduct unannounced audits as necessary. The audit process includes on-site inspections, document reviews, and worker and 
management interviews. We report aggregated results of these audits in our Purpose Reporting Hub. 
● Certification: Suppliers must agree to comply with the Supplier Code of Conduct as well as international standards and applicable laws 
and regulations when they enter into master purchasing agreements or equivalent terms and conditions with Cisco. This creates legally 
enforceable obligations, including in cases where the law is silent or allows practices that violate Cisco policies. We require suppliers to 
acknowledge the Supplier Code of Conduct at the onset of the relationship.  
● Accountability: Non-conformance with the Supplier Code of Conduct is taken very seriously. Cisco works with suppliers to develop 
Corrective Action Plans (CAPs), identify the root cause of the non-conformance, and strives to ensure that corrective actions are 
implemented in the shortest possible timeline. Corrective actions may include the immediate return of passports or facilitating 
reimbursement of paid recruitment fees within 90 days of discovery. Corrective actions are followed by preventative actions to ensure 
that non-conformances do not reoccur and to reduce future risk. Such actions may include ensuring the facility has a policy in place and 
workers are aware of the policy, and that contracts are clear and in a language workers can understand. Multiple teams collaborate to 
hold suppliers accountable and to help ensure actions are completed by specified deadlines. Cisco’s approach is to drive continuous 
improvement with suppliers and engage them with short and long-term improvement plans, as needed. To help make lasting 
improvements, Cisco will monitor and coach suppliers across multiple years, as is appropriate. 
Cisco uses supplier scorecards to help measure and manage suppliers' conformance to Cisco's environmental and human rights 
requirements. Scorecards factor into Cisco's supply chain business processes for sourcing and procurement decisions and are discussed 
with suppliers during business reviews. Suppliers are scored on factors such as audit performance and closing nonconformances on time,

including nonconformances for the prohibition of forced labor or young workers. Having Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) 
metrics alongside cost, quality, and service delivery allows managers to make informed decisions when awarding business to suppliers. 
When Cisco’s standards are not met, we may disqualify the supplier from consideration for future business or terminate the supplier’s 
relationship with Cisco. 
Additionally, our Supply Chain ESG Committee is a committee comprised of senior members of management that helps assure progress 
against our priorities, including forced labor due diligence. This committee establishes management oversight of human rights risks and 
opportunities within the supply chain. The committee oversees the integration of human rights policies and priorities into business 
operations and regularly reviews due diligence results including audit nonconformances, forced labor allegations, and minerals supply 
chain risks. The committee convenes our Senior Vice President of Supply Chain Operations and other management representing Global 
Manufacturing Operations, Global Supplier Management, Services and Logistics, Technology and Quality, Product and Component 
Operations, Supply Chain Transformation, and Legal.  
As well as conducting its own standard due diligence, Cisco investigates and addresses allegations brought to our attention from internal 
and external channels, such as Cisco EthicsLine. Issues detected outside of the Verification and Audit processes outlined above are tracked 
through our incident management system and assessed against our policies and commitments. We investigate further to assess the 
validity of allegations, assess for human rights risks and impacts and determine the severity of the violation. If impacts have occurred, we 
implement corrective actions that aim to stop the harm of workers and prevent future harm to workers according to the closure timelines 
that we follow in our regular due diligence processes. When possible, we work to provide access to remedy.  
Cisco EthicsLine is a publicly available multilingual ethics and business conduct reporting tool which allows anonymous reporting of 
alleged illegal or unethical behavior. It is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, worldwide. Cisco believes our employees, 
customers, partners, suppliers, shareholders, and stakeholders have a responsibility to speak up promptly about any conduct or 
circumstances they believe, in good faith, may constitute a violation of the Code of Business Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, or 
any other Cisco policy. Anyone can raise concerns if they become aware of possibly unlawful or unethical conduct or suspect there has 
been a violation of Cisco’s Code of Business Conduct or any company policies. Information on accessing EthicsLines and the rules of 
procedure are publicly available in written Cisco policies and on Cisco’s EthicsLine webpage. Issues are documented by a highly trained 
impartial interview specialist and disseminated to appropriate Cisco management who will promptly address the matter as per the 
publicly posted written rules of procedure. EthicsLine is available in more than 20 languages and interpreters are additionally available to 
assist with the interview if deemed necessary by the caller. Cisco has a strict nonretaliation policy, meaning that employees who report 
business conduct violations in good faith cannot be subject to any adverse employment action, including separation, demotion, 
suspension, or loss of benefits because of the report. Cisco's Global Reporting and Anti-Retaliation Policy is on the Cisco website and 
further details Cisco's protection of whistleblowers. Cisco respects the confidentiality of stakeholders who report business conduct 
violations.  
Furthermore, for our own employees, we require compliance with our COBC, and employees certify compliance annually. Our COBC 
describes how to raise concerns, which are tracked at both regional and corporate levels. 
● Training: Our strategy includes capacity strengthening for our suppliers and employees. We regularly engage suppliers across the globe 
for training on Code fundamentals. This helps us build awareness, propagate best practices, and focus on continuous improvement. RBA 
workshops and training content are mutually beneficial for Cisco and our suppliers, ensuring understanding of policies and standards, and 
supporting the uptake of tools and resources for identifying, addressing, and mitigating risks. RBA’s Learning Academy provides online 
trainings on a range of topics, including methods to combat trafficking and forced labor in the supply chain. As part of our audit process, 
suppliers are directed to training resources related to an audit nonconformance and are expected to complete the training. When 
appropriate, Cisco also collaborates with RBA members to conduct focused trainings with high-risk suppliers and share best practices. For 
our own employees, our COBC training helps guide our employees to make ethical, professional, and respectful choices. Since FY2020, 
Cisco has provided internal training about human rights issues that can be found in supply chains to raise awareness and educate 
employees on how they can play a role in helping Cisco follow through on our human rights commitments. This training covers how to 
interpret our policies on key issues such as forced labor and child labor, detect warning signs of risks such as forced labor and child labor,

how to report if they suspect violations of Cisco’s standards and policies, and how they can support work to help hold suppliers 
accountable. These trainings are incorporated into Cisco’s internal Education Management System and are required to be taken every two 
years by employees of Supply Chain Operations – which includes employees responsible for sourcing and procurement, supplier 
management, planning, manufacturing, logistics, quality and other employees around the world who are most likely to encounter human 
rights issues in day-to-day supply chain operations. 
Cisco provides additional details and annual updates about our supplier engagement process and actions regarding forced labor, in our Purpose 
Reporting Hub. 
Actions taken during Fiscal Year 2024 
In FY 2024, we launched a steering committee to embed human rights in Supply Chain Operations. Its charter is to integrate human rights into 
business strategies and operations with the intent to reduce harm, prevent risks, and effect positive outcomes for workers. The committee is 
comprised of senior leaders in Cisco’s Supply Chain and Human Rights functions with the necessary expertise and influence to set and drive the 
strategy.  
Each year, we audit suppliers to assess their conformance to the Supplier Code of Conduct and identify and address any gaps. Risks for child labor 
are assessed under the Young Workers provision whereas risks to forced labor assessed under the Prohibition of Forced Labor provision to our 
Supplier Code of Conduct. When nonconformances are identified, we address them according to the steps outlined in our Supplier Code of 
Conduct and policies. This includes removing impacted workers from harm, addressing impacts, and remediating where applicable. 
In FY 2024, Cisco did not observe cases of underage child labor (workers under the age of 15). Nonconformances with our Supplier Code of 
Conduct that were identified included young workers not receiving legally mandated health checks and suppliers with incomplete policies and 
procedures for managing interns and student workers. In these instances, we worked with our suppliers and opened Corrective Action Plans for 
those nonconformances which are closed or on track to closure.  
In FY 2024, audits continued to uncover nonconformances to our Supplier Code of Conduct for the Prohibition of Forced Labor in multiple tiers of 
our supply chain, including manufacturing partners, components suppliers, and sub-tier. These nonconformances ranged in severity from Priority 
to Major to Minor.   
Most Major and Minor nonconformances to the prohibition of forced labor were related to workers paying small fees in the recruitment process, 
such as one-time fees for health examinations, deposits, or transportation fees. These fees often amount to less than 5% of the worker’s monthly 
salary. Some suppliers had the practice of reimbursing workers after commencement of employment, but this is still not in conformance to the 
Code and our expectations. Our teams work with suppliers to implement employer payment of these fees directly, rather than reimbursing 
workers.  
Less often, we saw Priority level findings, some of which identified risks of bonded labor, a type of forced labor. Typically, this involved foreign 
migrant workers who paid excessive recruitment fees equivalent to a month or more of their gross wages. It is strictly prohibited for workers to 
pay these fees and there is a serious risk of workers becoming bonded by debt and forced to work to repay loans or excessive fees to labor 
brokers.    
When bonded labor issues are identified, we take steps to address them, which may include the following:   
1. 
Institute the Employer Pays Principle. This entails having suppliers develop policies and procedures to stop forced labor risks and stop 
the fees being charged to workers. These supplier actions can include: instituting a “no fees” policy; instituting a due diligence process 
for assessing labor brokers; amending agreements and contracts with labor brokers so that the employer pays all fees; or amending 
workers’ contracts so that they are prohibited from paying fees. When policies are adjusted, workers should be trained and informed 
about the "no fee" policies in a language they can understand. This training is also integrated into the recruitment process for future 
workers. 
2. 
Conduct an RBA-approved third-party fees investigation. This deeper investigation assesses the scale and scope of impacted workers 
who have paid fees amounting to more than one month’s salary. Workers are interviewed with a goal of identifying fees they paid along

their recruitment journey from the country of departure to the destination country of employment, recurring fees deducted from their 
paychecks, or fees paid to other intermediaries or for travel. As a result, Cisco gains information on how many workers were impacted 
and how much money they might have paid, and suppliers better understand how workers were affected through dialogues with them. 
After the fee investigation, suppliers must submit a reimbursement plan to RBA for approval.  
3. 
Work with the supplier employer to reimburse. A direct outcome of the investigation is to calculate the total reimbursement to affected 
workers, develop a plan to reimburse, and determine the actual cost of recruitment moving forward. Cisco helps suppliers develop and 
implement the reimbursement plan in a timely manner and works to monitor the plan until all workers have been repaid. To ensure 
mutual agreement on reimbursement amounts, Cisco’s standard operating procedure also involves asking suppliers to have workers 
sign a letter acknowledging they understand why they’re being reimbursed, the amount, and that it includes all fees paid during the 
recruitment process. Cisco reviews these signed letters alongside further supporting evidence of repayment such as pay slips and bank 
transfer reports. While Cisco asks all suppliers to do this, not all suppliers are able to do so, such as in instances when they have already 
completed the reimbursement by the time Cisco receives the case. In other cases, workers have already departed the supplier and Cisco 
or the supplier are unable to locate all of these departed workers. Subsequent RBA audits validate that the affected workers were 
adequately remediated.  
During FY 2024, we pursued corrective actions for nonconformances identified in China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, 
including driving more than US$1.7 million in fee reimbursements to 2,290 workers across our direct and sub-tier suppliers for recruitment fees 
occurring in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. Meanwhile, 100% of forced labor Priority Nonconformances are closed or in progress of being 
remediated. An overview of the number of RBA nonconformances found related to forced labor can be seen in our published audit data, including 
geographic distribution. 
Each year, we aim to continuously improve our due diligence processes based on what we have learned. Recently, forced labor risks have been 
uncovered most commonly in assessments of new components suppliers, new facility locations, and extend our reach into our sub-tier suppliers 
with whom we do not have direct contractual relationships. Accordingly, we have strengthened our due diligence during our new supplier and 
new site onboarding processes and during acquisition integration processes. Through these processes, we identified forced labor risks at three 
prospective supplier sites prior to production during FY24. By identifying, addressing, and remediating these risks ahead of launching or scaling 
business with the supplier, we avoid contributing to harm of these workers.  
We continue to work on increasing awareness of international expectations around human rights due diligence, forced labor due diligence, and 
building the capabilities of suppliers to address these issues more broadly and deeper within the supply chain. This prevents risks in our own 
supply chain and propagates international standards so that they are followed throughout the industry for the betterment of all electronics 
workers.  
We view collaboration with manufacturing partners as pivotal to our ability to address systemic issues, including forced labor, in the sub-tier 
supply chain. In FY 2024, we partnered with manufacturing partners in Taiwan to train their suppliers on forced labor issues.  Thirty participants 
from 19 suppliers attended Cisco-sponsored Forced Labor training sessions, 12 suppliers of which were sub-tier suppliers to Cisco. The two-day 
training was focused on the RBA Code of Conduct expectations and RBA tools for forced labor due diligence, such as a Responsible Recruitment 
Due Diligence Toolkit. Cisco is continuing this work to train our direct and sub-tier suppliers to identify, remediate, and prevent forced labor in 
their recruitment and employment practices throughout fiscal 2025.   
We frequently publish case studies about our work to address forced labor as part of our commitment to continuous improvement and with the 
intent to share our learnings with others. See case studies here.   
Sourcing Minerals Responsibly 
To help address the human rights risks in our complex mineral supply chain, Cisco has implemented a comprehensive due diligence process. The 
Cisco Responsible Minerals Program aligns to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for

Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from CAHRAs. Details about this program including due diligence strategy, efforts to hold suppliers 
accountable, and results of our work can be found in our calendar year 2023 Conflict Minerals Report.   
Commitment to Leadership Through Collaboration and Transparency  
We are actively involved in advancing industry-wide responsible practices through our engagement in the RBA, a nonprofit alliance of leading 
companies dedicated to respecting the rights and promoting well-being of workers and communities engaged in the global electronics supply 
chain. Cisco is a founding member of the RBA and contributes to the development and periodic revision of the RBA Code of Conduct and 
guidance. Cisco also participates in RBA’s Responsible Labor Initiative, a multi-stakeholder initiative focused on ensuring the rights of workers 
vulnerable to forced labor in global supply chains are consistently respected and promoted. Since FY2023, Cisco has served on the RLI Steering 
Committee which is responsible for the strategic guidance and direction of the RLI and reports to the RBA Board of Directors. Through our 
participation, we aim to collaborate with peers to strengthen collective impact and drive solutions at scale to address forced labor risks in global 
supply chains. 
Cisco also participates in the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) and leverages its tools and programs to advance responsible sourcing.  
We are committed to transparently communicating our actions. For further information on Cisco’s work to maintain a socially responsible supply 
chain, refer to our  Purpose Reporting Hub. 
Assessing Cisco’s Effectiveness  
Cisco has measures to assess the effectiveness of its actions including tracking the number of internal trainings on human rights in supply chains 
that we have rolled out and the number of CAPs and preventative actions we have developed and implemented with our suppliers. We 
communicate our program metrics in our Purpose Reporting Hub and also summarize these metrics in the chart below:
