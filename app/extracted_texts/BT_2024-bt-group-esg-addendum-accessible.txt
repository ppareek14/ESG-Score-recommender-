BT Group plc ESG Addendum to the BT Group plc Annual Report 2024
“As a responsible business, we 
openly and regularly share the 
progress we are making on the 
BT Group Manifesto and in 
support of our purpose, to 
connect for good.
Simon Lowth
Chief Financial Officer
Being transparent through our ESG 
disclosures is essential in building trust 
with all of our stakeholders. It provides 
tangible proof of how we’re making a 
positive contribution to society and 
the environment, and helps us to grow 
our business, reduce risk, and attract 
and retain diverse talent. 
We report on material ESG topics in our 
Annual Report; this Addendum offers 
more detailed data and disclosures to 
meet growing expectations for 
enhanced transparency on ESG topics. 
Oversight of progress on the Manifesto 
and our ESG reporting is integrated 
across our governance structures.
Over recent years, we’ve seen a huge 
shift in the ESG reporting landscape, 
which advance the range of disclosures 
that we and other businesses make. 
We’d like to see greater levels of 
consistency and further coordination 
among regulators and standard-
setters, to enable us to provide the 
most meaningful, comparable and 
efficient response.

Governance
Our Board-level Responsible Business 
Committee oversees our BT Group 
Manifesto and responsible business 
strategy, and tracks progress towards 
our related targets and ambitions.
Our BT Group Chief Executive Allison 
Kirkby takes strategic decisions, 
exercising delegated authority from 
the Board, with assistance from the 
Executive Committee in development 
and execution of the strategy and risk 
management.
We integrate ESG into our reward 
approach. We have a sustainability 
underpin for awards made under our 
Restricted Share Plan for executive 
directors. This means that we must 
have made sufficient progress towards 
our sustainability commitments for 
awards to be made. This could include 
progress made on our carbon 
emissions, carbon avoidance and 
circularity goals.

BT Group plc ESG Addendum to the BT Group plc Annual Report 2024
Identifying our ESG priorities
We prioritise the environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics that are most 
impactful to our business and our stakeholders – 
our material issues.
We conduct a materiality assessment every other 
year to inform our strategy and reporting.
The assessment, guided by AccountAbility’s 
AA1000ASv3 accounting standard, used 
quantitative and qualitative data from sources 
including social media listings and interviews with 
key internal stakeholders, as well as industry 
collaborations, reports, studies and surveys.
Further details of the sources used and 
approach taken can be seen in our 
BT Group social and environment 
reporting methodology 2024, 
at bt.com/esgaddendum
In 2023, we conducted analysis to understand 
our most material ESG topics. Across a range of 
relevant sustainability topics, we considered:
–	 the internal impact on our business – from a 
financial and risk perspective
–	 the importance of each topic to our key 
stakeholder groups – colleagues, customers, 
investors, suppliers, government and 
regulatory bodies.
Both aspects are captured in the ‘Materiality 
analysis 2023’ chart on the following page.
The analysis showed that our most material ESG 
topics remained broadly consistent with those 
reported in our previous 2021 analysis.
Our most significantly material issues remained 
as Customer experience, Data / cyber security, 
Network investment, and Economic impacts 
– these general topic areas are covered throughout 
our BT Group Annual Report 2024 (AR).
The topics of Digital skills and Business ethics 
also retained high stakeholder importance and 
high business impact scores, topics that are 
integral to our responsible business agenda, 
and our BT Group Manifesto, launched in 2021.
We engage regularly with stakeholders to 
understand what’s important to them and ESG 
has remained high on the agenda again this year 
for investors and other stakeholders.
In order to comply with future EU Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive legislation, 
we are currently conducting a double materiality 
analysis, which will consider, across a range of ESG 
topics, our impacts on people and planet, and their 
financial impacts on our operations. We’re involving 
our key stakeholders throughout that process. 
The results and outputs of that double materiality 
analysis will be built into our future reporting.
Ongoing stakeholder dialogue also enables us to 
share plans and progress, accelerates innovation 
and partnerships, and keeps us accountable.
Read more on how we connect with 
stakeholders in our AR pages 40-45
Many of our material ESG topics are linked directly to our BT Group Manifesto key 
pillars of Responsible, Inclusive and Sustainable:

BT Group plc ESG Addendum to the BT Group plc Annual Report 2024
Our social and economic contribution
This year, we’ve continued to deliver social and economic value by:
Supporting the UK economy
According to a report commissioned in 2023, we supported a total of 284,000 total full time equivalent jobs in the UK (directly and indirectly) in one year, that’s 1 in every 90 
employees working in the UK economy. There was a £24 billion total Gross Value Added (GVA) impact associated with BT Group activities, supporting £1 in every £80 of UK 
GVA. We spent over £9.3bn a year with UK-based suppliers.
Read more about how we contribute to the UK economy in our Economic Impact Report, prepared by independent consultancy firm Hatch UK Economic Impact 
Report 2023
Paying our taxes
Our tax strategy sits at the heart of our business responsibility agenda, ensuring that we pay our fair share of taxes and that we conduct our tax affairs ethically and with integrity. 
The taxes we pay in the countries in which we operate contribute to the local economies and people’s lives. We’re proud to be a major contributor of taxes in the UK – the One 
Hundred Group 2023 Total Tax Contribution survey ranked us as the seventh highest UK contributor. Our BT Group plc Tax strategy provides details on our overall approach, 
as well as specific information relating to our UK tax contribution. Taxes paid during FY24 are covered in our AR.
Read more on tax in our AR pages 164-167 
Read more about our approach in our Tax Strategy
Supporting our suppliers
Our suppliers want us to pay them in line with our agreed terms, help them optimise their own supply chains and cash flow management, and act ethically and transparently.
We support the Government’s Prompt Payment Code (PPC) in the UK, and we’re a current signatory. In the latest half year reporting period H2, we paid 97% of all our supplier 
invoices on time, 96% of all supplier invoices within 60 days, and more than 98% of our small and micro suppliers within 30 days. We temporarily fell short of our PPC targets for 
H1 due to system migration and transformation issues, but we managed to recover performance by September. We will build on this through further improvement initiatives on 
supplier payment in line with the new Government guidelines to achieve average days to pay of 45 or less going forward. 
We are compliant in accurately reporting supplier payment performance as part of the mandatory UK Duty To Report requirements
Read more on how we engage with our suppliers in our AR page 44
Keeping the nation and our 
customers safe
Our networks, and the data that flows through them, are the core of our business, and protecting these assets is vital. Over the last year, we identified and blocked or sent to 
spam folders over 14bn suspicious attempts to email our customers. We also blocked more than 140m unwanted calls, 76m spam SMS messages, and over 8,000 phishing 
sites that were targeting our customers. We employ some 3,600 cyber security professionals and have a 76-person strong team of ‘ethical hackers’ constantly probing our 
own security. We were awarded the prestigious Prime Minister’s Award for Cyber, for helping customers avoid text message scams.
We’re also the first voice heard when someone in the UK calls the 999 emergency service – in FY24 we took over 40m 999 calls, answering each in under one second on average.
Respecting privacy
As a network and service provider, it’s important to keep our customers’ information safe so they can communicate freely. By safeguarding our customers’ privacy and security 
online, we in turn support their right to free expression. Read more about our approach to privacy and free expression, including how we safeguard customers privacy, how we 
balance privacy with government investigatory powers, and how we address online harms and illegal content.
bt.com/privacy-and-free-expression and bt.com/privacy
Partnering with charities
Through our charity partnership with Home-Start UK, we’ve provided support for families struggling with digital exclusion, isolation, physical health problems and many 
other issues – our gift-in-kind contributions, fundraising and donations for Home-Start UK totalled more than £134,000 this year. We work with our international charity partner 
UNICEF, where we provided funding support for their Digital Learning Passport – a tech platform which enables online and offline access to quality educational resources for 
young people. Our colleagues donated over £1.3m to more than 1,100 charities through payroll contributions. BT Group received the Payroll Giving Silver Award quality mark 
from HM Government, awarded to employers that have succeeded in generating sustainable income sources for UK charities through Payroll Giving.
We began a partnership with The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, where we provide financial contributions to the charity and volunteering opportunities for colleagues.
Volunteering time and expertise This year, our colleagues volunteered over 53,000 hours to support our charity partners and communities – including sharing their skills and expertise through mentoring and 
digital skills training programmes.

Environmental management
We’ve made bold carbon reduction and circular commitments as part of the BT Group Manifesto, but we also manage other environmental impacts and risks 
to ensure our progress is built on strong foundations
Certifying environmental 
management systems
Our environmental management system (EMS) in the UK, Ireland, Benelux, France, Germany, Italy and Spain are certified to ISO 14001:2015. Our energy management systems 
in the UK and Germany are certified to ISO 50001.
We publish our UK quality assurance certifications at bt.com/quality
Ensuring environmental 
compliance
We always aim to comply with relevant environmental legislation for our operations and products. This includes making sure our products and any electrical or electronic 
equipment sold to our UK business comply with regulations on waste electrical equipment, hazardous substances, chemicals and packaging. If any issues occur, we work with 
the relevant authorities to resolve them. We aim to meet our commitments under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 
2005. No major environmental breaches have occurred this year.
Managing environmental risk
We take a consistent approach to addressing risks, impacts and regulatory compliance through our Health Safety and Environment Group Policy Statement and EMS. 
Our Group Health Safety and Environment subcommittee, chaired by the Chief Security and Networks Officer, has responsibility for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on 
the effectiveness of the EMS, as well as being the focus for encouraging leadership, accountability and commitment in the effective management of risks in respect of Health, 
Safety and Environment across the group. The subcommittee reports to the Executive Committee every six months.
Read more in our AR page 46
Managing fuel storage risks
We have around 6,500 fuel storage tanks across the UK to fuel the diesel generators we use as back up during power cuts and to keep our customers connected in remote 
locations. We monitor, maintain and upgrade these tanks and pipework. If there’s a spill, we use specialist contractors to make sure it’s cleaned up carefully and we report any 
major leaks to the regulator. No incidents at BT Group sites have been subject to investigation or legal proceedings from any of the UK regulators for several years.
Mitigating and adapting 
to climate risk
We report on how we’re responding to climate-related risks and opportunities across a range of future climate scenarios, under the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial 
Disclosure recommendations.
Read more in our AR pages 72-81
Tackling air pollution
Our transition to electric vehicles is helping to reduce air pollutants from combustion engines as well as cutting carbon. 
Read more in our AR page 37
Nurturing biodiversity 
and nature
We use our EMS to help us manage biodiversity impacts, and we monitor wildlife-related incidents or risks at our sites. This year, we’ve been working with Little Blue Research Ltd 
to help develop our future strategy on biodiversity and nature-related disclosures, aligned to the draft Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures framework 
requirements, and to better understand BT Group’s risks and opportunities relating to nature. Openreach is also a member of the UK Business and Biodiversity Forum.
As well as BT Group partnering with The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts to offer financial support and colleague volunteering opportunities to our colleagues, Openreach has 
created a Business Conservation Partnership with the RSPB, to ensure that, moving forward, they are better placed to implement nature-positive actions as part of the overall 
fibre build programme.
Openreach also worked closely with NatureScot and National Trust for Scotland this year as part of the fibre build to Fair Isle (situated between Orkney and Shetland). They 
scheduled their build to ensure nesting birds were left undisturbed during the breeding season, and worked together to minimise impacts on native plant species.

Water consumption
Our UK water use fell this year by 12% to 1,349,324m3, due mainly to operating our adiabatic cooling units more efficiently within network equipment environmental limits, and 
dealing effectively with leaks. Using water self-supply has helped us save over £3.6m since 2019, and has allowed us to improve how we monitor water usage, pinpoint areas of 
concern and fix leaks in order to minimise water wastage.
Helping customer 
save carbon
We’ve helped customers avoid 1,517,299 tonnes of carbon this year, mainly through full fibre broadband reducing personal or work-related travel. As we develop more products 
and services, like Internet of Things and AI, we expect this number to grow. Associated revenues from carbon-saving products amounted to £6bn this year.
Circularity
Globally, we generated 69,000 tonnes of waste this year, of which 65.2% was recycled, 5.5% was reused, and 19.7% was recovered – the remaining 9.6% went to landfill. 
For the UK, our total recycling, reuse and recovery rate was 92.1%. This year, our total waste decreased (14% less than FY23). Our target is to achieve zero waste to landfill 
by 2030, by increasing the amount we reuse and recycle whilst limiting our use of energy from waste disposal routes to only where it is unavoidable. 
3,300 tonnes of network equipment has been reused or recycled this year, the majority of which was through our Exchange Clearance Operations programme, working with 
partners n2s and TXO. We also recovered over 2,400 tonnes of batteries for recycling. Our Network teams used over 10,000 pieces of refurbished network equipment within 
our operation, of which 17% were recovered from within BT Group’s own network. 
We’ve agreed a deal with a leading bank and global recycler EMR until 2028, to support the extraction and recycling of copper cable from our legacy network. Copper is a key 
material for the energy transition1, and the scaling up of its extraction from our networks will ensure it can be fed back into the supply chain for reutilisation. 
Our return rate for leased customer premises equipment was 67% for 2023 (our target is 75% by FY26). 
Over 2.4m home hubs and set-top boxes were returned to us, and of those that went through our refurbishment operation, 71% were reused, with the remainder being 
responsibly recycled. We expanded our refurbishment operation to now include our BT Business hubs. We also began converting surplus BT Smart Hub 2s to create fully 
refurbished Plusnet Hub 2 routers, this avoided over 94,000 routers being manufactured from new. We collected a total of nearly 166,000 mobile devices through our consumer 
and business trade-in schemes, over 96% of these were reused, with the rest being recycled. This equates to a take-back rate of 5.2% for distributed mobile devices; we have 
a target to increase this to at least 20% by 2030, forming part of our GSMA commitment to drive towards a circular economy on mobile devices. The EE Trade-In service also 
surpassed the 1m device traded-in milestone since its launch in 2023 during the year.
Working with our catering partner, Lexington, we launched CauliBox across 12 BT Group UK locations. This reusable container solution helps replace single-use takeaway boxes 
and cups, reducing unnecessary waste and encouraging a reuse culture. Since its launch in January, over 7,600 reusable containers have been borrowed. This followed on from 
the introduction earlier in the year of a 20p surcharge for all takeaway containers in catered offices. Our catered sites also diverted 2,120kg of coffee grounds from waste and 
saved over 16.2t of CO2e from recycling used cooking oil.

Pay gap – supplementary data1
Pay gap information is an important measure of progress towards our Inclusion, Equity and Diversity 
goals. We have a legal obligation to analyse and report on our gender pay gap. Since 2021 we have 
reported our ethnicity pay gap, and this year we publish our disability pay gap for the first time.
For our pay gap statements, refer to bt.com/genderpaygap. We include some further supplementary 
information in the tables below.

Inclusion, equity and diversity initiatives – supplementary
BT Group has partnered with several organisations to increase our reach and attraction: 
We’re working with a number of external partners to showcase our employment opportunities, and to 
provide internships or permanent roles. They include Women Returners, Code First Girls, 10,000 Black 
Interns, 10,000 Able Interns, and the Aleto Leadership Programme. 
We’ve partnered with McKinsey & Co to launch the Connected Leaders Academy with the aim to 
accelerate racial equity. The academy offers course content relevant to Asian, Black, Hispanic and 
Latino leaders, with a focus on early professionals, midcareer managers, and senior executives.
Our Carers Network partnered with Carers UK to support the lobbying for The Carer’s Leave Act 2023. 
Supporting our leaders to create an inclusive environment for all:
We’ve expanded diverse shortlisting, previously only at Senior Manager roles but now throughout all 
levels, and use it to address the under-representation of specific groups within BT Group where it’s the 
most appropriate course of action.
This year we launched ‘Leading Inclusively & Safely’, a 10-month learning programme for our senior 
leaders to build more inclusive leadership practices, with over 80% of leaders enrolled so far. The 
programme focuses on creating an inclusive climate, building psychological safety, developing a 
sense of belonging and learning how to have conversations about inclusion. 
We continue to invest in our diverse talent through targeted programmes:
Disability Career Development Programme: we’ve run a development programme pilot specifically 
aimed at junior disabled colleagues, to help them grow and develop.
Connect with Respect, an Openreach Field Inclusion Programme: a team-based intervention focused 
on respectful and inclusive behaviour and team contracting on microaggressions.
Career Returner programme, Networks and Business: helping parents who have been out of the 
workplace onto a supported programme, which resulted in 18 of them joining as BT Group employees.
BT Group maintains a very active set of award-winning colleague-driven people networks who 
continue to raise awareness and advocate for change both within and outside the group: 
The BT Group Ethnic Diversity Network were awarded the best People Network at the Ethnicity Awards, 
a UK-wide organisation that celebrates individuals and organisations that support Black, Asian and 
diverse Ethnic communities. 
Pride (LGBTQ+) – Employee Network of the Year at the DIVA Awards
Our Able2 (Disability) network nominated for best network at the British Diversity Awards 
International Women’s Day – our Gender network partnered with Women@Tech and hosted a global 
panel event with over 3,000 colleagues from 17 global offices, and virtually with panelists from 
BT Group, Openreach, Meta, Cisco, Colt, Amazon and Google. 
Our Gender Network have started a Senior Women’s Network, bringing together our senior women to 
create a safe space to feel supported and support each other as an underrepresented group, and to 
motivate them to lead similar events for women in their part of the business.
International Day of Disabled People – to celebrate, BT Group and Openreach held a shared event with 
Breaking Boundaries Awards, powered by our Able2 (Disability) network, on the theme of ‘Confident 
Conversations’ at the BT Tower. 
Through the Pride Network, the BT Group-supported LGBT Switchboard celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of running their helpline that has supported an estimated 4m people, with an event at BT Tower. We 
continue to support the charity with connectivity, technology and service requirements as well as 
volunteers from our LGBTQ+ community. 
During Pride season 2023, around 1,200 of our colleagues marched throughout the UK.

Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) index
The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is an independent non-profit organisation that sets standards to guide the disclosure of financially material sustainability information by 
companies to their investors. SASB Standards identify the subset of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues most relevant to financial performance in each of 77 industries.
The table below cross-references the SASB accounting metrics with where that information can be found in BT Group’s AR, ESG Addendum, or other publications, and covers the financial year ending 
31 March 2024, unless otherwise stated.

1)	Number of law enforcement requests for 
customer information
2)	Number of customers whose information 
was requested
3)	Percentage resulting in disclosure
Quantitative
Number
In the UK, secrecy rules (under the Investigatory 
Powers Act 2016) prevent operators from 
confirming or denying the existence of certain 
investigatory powers requests. With industry, we 
have considered whether the Investigatory Powers 
(Disclosure of Statistical Information) Regulations 
2018 provide any additional avenue for disclosure. 
BT Group’s view is that the current approach (where 
the regulator discloses information centrally, on 
behalf of all industry) is the better approach to give 
a full and timely picture, given the secrecy 
provisions which remain in terms of certain requests 
for data. We do speak with the regulator to review 
this position and to consider ways to increase the 
effectiveness of that regulatory disclosure.

We report qualifying incidents to the relevant

where we are legally required to do so and within 
the timeframes mandated. To the extent that the 
relevant regulators ever find fault with our data 
breach management and/or data security 
practices, they publish their findings/sanctions – 
typically in their Annual Reports and on their 
websites. There were no such sanctions in FY21, 
FY22, FY23 or FY24.

N/A
We adhere to the current EU net neutrality 
regulation which has been transposed into UK law. 
In October 2023, Ofcom published its updated 
guidance on how the net neutrality rules should 
apply, providing additional clarity to enable ISPs 
to innovate and manage their networks more 
efficiently. We welcome the flexibility in Ofcom’s 
guidance, but it is our view that a full Government 
review is required in order to ensure the rules remain 
fit for purpose for today’s internet ecosystem.
